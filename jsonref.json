The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

Photograph: MaxwellsLeaving Cert students and their families are being urged to take extra caution in the run-up to the exams to help minimise the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks.Minister for Education Norma Foley said students have done an “amazing job” in complying with public health measures so far and she has every confidence this will continue over the coming weeks.She made the comments after official State Examinations Commission guidance to schools confirmed that students should not sit the exams if they have Covid-19 symptoms.“I am very conscious that - particularly for the Leaving Certificate students - we are moving to a very critical period and we are advising them once again that they would be mindful, that they keep their social distance, wear masks, reduce contacts,” Ms Foley said.“We’re extending that to family members, and to people they meet within the community that there would be a heightened awareness and consciousness around the Leaving Certificate.“But I have every confidence in them. I think we are very proud of all that has been achieved by young people in our schools and I’ve every confidence that they will continue to do what needs to be done.”When asked if there were concerns that some students could be tempted to sit exams even if they should be self-isolating, Ms Foley said the vast majority of pupils have followed public health guidance to date.Best practice“On a daily basis, they’ve been advised not to come to schools if they have symptoms... They have, in the main, done that... This is a about reinforcing best practice around what they have been doing up to this point - and I have confidence that they will do that.”Teachers, meanwhile, are due to begin the process of estimating their students’ marks as part of the new accredited grades system being introduced this year.Under this model, students have the option of choosing an accredited grade or sitting them exam in each subject and being credited with the highest results.When asked if she was concerned that this approach could result in even greater grade inflation than last year, Ms Foley said schools were being given clear guidance on how to approach marking their students.Teachers and school leaders were very conscious of the need to ensure students are awarded “realistic” marks and the need for accurate information in the standardisation process, she said.“I have every confidence that that process will operate as it should operate,” she said.Ms Foley was speaking during a visit to Pobalscoil Neásain in Dublin 13, where she met sixth year students and staff.Most sixth year students are due to finish their classes over the coming days and many schools are organising socially-distanced school graduation ceremonies.‘Damp squib’Principal Pat McKenna said there was a strange atmosphere in school with many students feeling anxious ahead of the start of the exams against the backdrop of the pandemic.“You’re not sensing the normal end-of-school excitement. It’s a little bit of a damp squib. There’s anxiety about how it’s going to go, but having the accredited grades in the back pocket is giving many a level of confidence.”On a positive note, he said, students have learned to become more independent learners due to the disruption to the school year, while the school has developed new ways of including students’ voices in the running of school.Students and the Leaving Cert: ‘I’m feeling stressed and nervous... I’m worried Covid could disrupt everything’ Even in normal times the Leaving Cert is a stressful rite of passage for most students .Uncertainty around whether Covid-19 cases could detail some students’ hopes of sitting the exams has added yet another layer of anxiety into the mix.“I’m definitely worried,” says Cian Doran, a sixth year student at Pobalscoil Neásain. “It could disrupt everything, which is worrying, so I’m trying to reduce my social contacts.”Student Karl Fitzpatrick is planning to sit all his written exams to ensure he maximises his chances of gaining CAO points, but the pressure is taking its toll“The exams are stressful enough as it is. To have the added issue of Covid on top of it all is a bit over-bearing,” he says.He wants to study for an arts degree in Irish and geography and go onto become a teacher. Rachelle Biayi, however, feels the chances of her exams being disrupted by Covid-19 are low due to the precautions being taken by students and the school.“Everyone will be wearing masks, they’ll be physically spaced out, so I think we’ll be sitting the exams without any problem,” she says.“Yes, I’m feeling stressed and nervous, but I’m channelling all that adrenaline into motivating me to do the best I can do.”Like many students at Pobalscoil Neásain, Vicky Ogundipe is planning to sit all her written exams and avail of accredited grades. Nonetheless, she is feeling anxious.“I’m really nervous and stressed,” she says. “There are a lot more people applying to the CAO this year and limited space on courses, but all I can do is try my very best.”The possibility of contracting Covid or being designated as a close contact is an occasional worry.“ I’ll keep doing what I’m doing to stay safe and make sure I can go ahead sit my exams. Our schools has done a good job of keeping us safe from Covid so far,” she adds.Mark Roche is also nervous, but his concerns are more focused on CAO points going up this year.“ I’m going for bio-medicine, so I’m worried it will go even higher than last year.“I’m sitting four exams, so I can focus on the ones I don’t do quite as well in to try to boost my points,” he says.Sophie Kelly is also hoping to score highly i given that medicine is her first choice.“I want to sit all the exams so I know that I’ll have done everything I could to secure my points rather than leaving it up to teachers.” she says.“I always wanted to go into medicine. Looking at stories on the news around the doctors and nurses who are working so hard show they are real-life super heroes. I’d love to go into that area.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoIf we don\u0026rsquot fix it, it will fix us,\u0026rsquo Prof Katharine Hayhoe tells Dublin Climate DialoguesECB chief economist suggests pledges need to match rollout policiesBurning fossil fuels in stoves contributes to 1.6m premature deaths of women annually"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 north s vaccination programme extended to people aged 25 29","story":"A vaccinator draws up the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Hexham, England. File photograph: Ian ForsythGetty ImagesThe North’s Covid-19 vaccination programme has been extended to people aged between 25 and 29. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland announced the expansion of the vaccination programme as of Thursday. Anyone born between May 1st, 1991, and July 31st, 1996, can now book an appointment at one of the regional trust vaccination centres, the department said, but warned that vaccine supplies remain limited. People are asked to be patient in waiting for their vaccines, with additional vaccination slots for following weeks being released every Thursday. The ongoing rollout of the vaccination programme in the North continues to be dependent on the availability of vaccine supplies, the department said. In accordance with the latest advice from the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), people under 40 who book to receive their vaccination at one of the trust centres receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Those under 40 who wish to make an “informed decision” to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine can book available slots at the SSE Arena in Belfast and at participating community pharmacies.Under current advice from the JCVI people aged under 40 in the North are to be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine where available because of a possible link between it and extremely rare blood clots. ‘Successful delivery’The North’s Minister for Health, Robin Swann, said the expansion of the programme was “a further testament to the successful delivery of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland”. More than 1 million people, or approximately 70 per cent of the North’s adult population, have so far received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland, and more than 500,000 have received their second. The Minister appealed to everyone who is eligible to book an appointment to receive the vaccine. This was echoed by the North’s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, who said that while the risk of severe disease was lower in younger people, some of them may get very sick. “There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post-Covid syndrome, or ‘long Covid’, which can be very debilitating for some,” he said.On Wednesday no further Covid-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland, while a further 107 people tested positive for the virus there. In the Republic, there was also no further deaths from Covid-19 announced, but 503 new cases were confirmed.Air qualityAs plans continue for further reopening of Irish society, an Oireachtas health committee heard on Wednesday that Ireland’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic had not placed enough focus on examining air quality and promoting good ventilation.Orla Hegarty, of University College Dublin’s school of architecture, planning and environmental policy, said the public health advice has failed to get across the importance of good ventilation in preventing the spread of the disease.Ms Hegarty, a member of the Expert Advisory Group on Ventilation and Covid-19, said there initially was “resistance” to admitting Covid-19 spreads through aerosols and that the main focus had been on hand hygiene.Ms Hegarty said ventilation had formed a key part of the initial pandemic response in Asian countries but this had not been the case in most English-speaking western countries.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures.

The construction representative group said the Government’s shared equity scheme will help middle-income earners buy homes. It has called for an extension of the Help to Buy scheme that offers tax relief to help first-time buyers secure a mortgage and to buy or build a house. More affordableTo help make mortgages more affordable, the builders’ group said that discretion lending exemptions should be considered to allow first-time buyers borrow more of the value of the property or more than the 3½ times the current annual income limit.Mr O’Neill said that while calling for a relaxation of lending rules, house-builders did not want “massive highs and massive lows” of fluctuating house prices seen over the past 15 years. “We don’t want massive price inflation because that’s not helpful either to our business. We just want sustainable house prices that people can afford.” The IHBA said in its production inflation tracker and cost impact assessment that increased global demand, especially in the US and China, which is partly driven by home upgrades and increased disposable income during lockdowns, has contributed to the rising cost of materials. Further cost increases are expected due to supply shortages in the second half of the year. Mr O’Neill said materials were costing more and becoming “harder to source”, and as a result builders would find it difficult to source funding for further housing developments or further phases of home-building projects if they have to absorb these higher costs. IHBA director James Benson said these shortages would delay building projects that had not secured existing supplies. Prices and rentsRonan Lyons, economics professor at Trinity College Dublin, said constructions costs were “the single most important determinant” of housing supply, which set purchases prices and rents, and that higher costs would affect Ireland more as it was already one of the most expensive places for house-building.“This is going to hurt us more than it will hurt other places. Every time you push up the cost you are going further and further up the income distribution in terms of who is viable to build for, and we are already higher up than where we want to be.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics how not to be wrong with james o brien","story":"British broadcaster and writer James O’Brien has built a loyal listenership on his LBC radio programme, dissecting the opinions of callers live on air every day.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said there is a need to resume travel and aviation and said there will be a “comprehensive statement” next week on how this will be done later in the summer.Mr Martin also told a private meeting of Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party that the announcement will also include plans for the future of mandatory hotel quarantine as well as sports and entertainment as part of the next phase of reopening for June and July.It is understood Mr Martin pointed to plans for the EU’s digital green certificate as offering a framework for the resumption of international travel as well as progress on Ireland’s vaccination programme.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, EU member states agreed to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-EU visitors ahead of the summer tourist season.EU countries approved a European Commission proposal to loosen the criteria to determine “safe” countries and to let in fully vaccinated tourists from elsewhere, EU sources said.They are expected to set a new list this week or early next week.Mr Martin said there was much work being done to evaluate mandatory hotel quarantine and spoke of the need to ensure connectivity for tourism, the economy and future growth.He gave what was described as an “upbeat” assessment of the vaccine rollout saying there was 280,000 jabs last week, the same number expected this week and up to 1 million doses to be administered in May.Mr Martin also told TDs and Senators it was the intention to offer vaccinations to teenagers if the clinical trials indicated it could be done.PfizerHe also hailed the\u0026nbspannouncement by Pfizer that it was to manufacture a component of the company’s vaccines in Ireland, saying it showed confidence in Ireland’s economy.On another Covid-19 related issue, Senator Lisa Chambers highlighted restrictions on the partners of pregnant women accompanying them to some hospitals. She said that there were anecdotal reports that women were being examined to determine how dilated they were before their partner was allowed on the labour ward.Mr Martin is said to have told the meeting short of visiting each maternity hospital himself he had been very clear on the need for restrictions to be lifted.\u0026nbspCathal Crowe, a Clare TD, said additional supports for Aer Lingus should include some conditionality related to the retention of air routes, protecting staff and the base at Shannon.He also argued that mandatory hotel quarantine is “excessive” given the current level of Covid-19 in Ireland and should be wound down.Clare-based Senator Timmy Dooley said there should be “very significant financial support” for Shannon and key routes to London Heathrow and the US must be protected.He also criticised Transport Minister Eamon Ryan claiming the Green Party leader has not delivered a plan for reopening aviation.EngagementCork East TD James O’Connor questioned if Mr Ryan has had enough engagement with stakeholders in the aviation sector and said there must be a strong marketing plan for Shannon Airport to boost transatlantic business ahead of the 2027 Ryder Cup golf tournament to be held in Co Limerick. \u0026nbspBoth the Taoiseach and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath defended the level of support offered to Aer Lingus and Mr Martin said he has plans to meet representatives from the air line.Mr Martin told the meeting the\u0026nbspGovernment was committed to regional connectivity and Shannon airport.The Taoiseach said the cyberattack on the HSE was extremely serious and he denounced the criminals that carried it out.He said hundreds of people including external expertise are involved in working on the issue and seeking to rebuild the IT system and restore health services.On housing Senior Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan told a private meeting of his party that Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits) should be banned from buying any residential property, but still be allowed to build housing units.He said housing will be the biggest issue in the upcoming Dublin Bay South by-election.GenerationMr Martin is said to have told the meeting that housing is the social issue of this generation and he outlined his party’s long-standing commitment to built social and affordable homes and to home ownership.He told the meeting he wants supply to be increased to 40,000 homes a year over the next decade and that the Government is approaching housing like Brexit and Covid-19 with “all hands are on deck”.He hit out at what he claimed was a lack of detail in Sinn Féin’s housing policy and arguing it is against any private sector delivery of homes and it would only exacerbate supply issues.Minister for Housing Mr O’Brien also addressed the meeting outlining his plans to boost supply."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

The promise is of cheaper food, closer economic ties with one of our historic allies, and yet more free trade deals to come. It may surprise you to know that I am not one of those farmers who is against freer trade. But let’s be clear: there will be consequences for farming, and the whole rural economy, particularly in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, if this is mishandled.The Government should not pretend that, without mitigating measures, untrammelled free trade would be anything other than existential for the beef industry, and by extension dairy farmers for whom beef is an important by-product. There is the doleful precedent of the agricultural depression after the repeal of the Corn Laws, deepened by the invention of refrigeration and the influx of tariff-free meat from the new world. Australian beef has recently competed on price on UK shelves despite a 20 per cent tariff and shipping costs.The threat was acknowledged in Brexit planning when the former Defra secretary Owen Paterson published a plan for generous subsidies for upland farmers, following the Swiss model, to allow them to continue farming for socio-economic reasons and to safeguard the landscape for tourism. Those plans need to be dusted down urgently.We also need realism. The Government should accept that British farmers cannot be expected to change their systems to find Australian-style efficiencies. The British public is unlikely to tolerate family farms disappearing and being replaced by corporates with low levels of stockmanship on vast ranches at one end, and animal welfare shortcuts and environmental compromises on huge feedlots at the other.There is no excuse in the digital age for lacking full traceability from field to plate and inspection of production standards. If these were enforced to current UK regulations, I would guess that most Australian farmers would conclude that selling into the British market was not worth the hassle. There needs to be honesty about this and the Government needs to put inspection resources where its mouth is on food standards and be far stricter on labelling – at the moment Australian beef can be labelled as British if processed here.But farmers also need to be realistic. The promise of cheap food was central to the Brexit offer and the public voted for this when they elected Boris Johnson on a mandate to “get Brexit done”. And we have become inefficient while in the EU. The conventional British model is still to pump grain into cattle and produce meat that is poorly differentiated from Australian feedlot beef. Livestock farmers need to embrace change. We can never compete head to head but we can produce beef from grass better than most of the world can, a premium product that is healthier, more ethical and very environmentally sustainable. We should be able to exploit new export markets with it.The Government therefore has a choice: it can help to invest in change and subsidise where there are genuine competitive disadvantages, or drive a wedge between Westminster and the North and West of the UK, undermining the Union.Jamie Blackett is the author of Red Rag to a Bull, Rural Life in an Urban Age (Quiller)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona bruce questioned bbc chairmans praise womanising genius","story":"The chairman of the BBC was taken to task by Fiona Bruce after holding up a famously sexist US physicist as the epitome of genius.Richard Sharp’s praise for Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Laureate, raised eyebrows during a BBC event.Mr Sharp was taking part in an online Q\u0026ampA with staff, hosted by Bruce, when he spoke approvingly of Feynman’s achievements while acknowledging that he was a womaniser.Bruce, the Question Time host, responded by asking if Mr Sharp was advocating the womanising aspect of Feynman’s character. Mr Sharp assured her that he was not.In his memoir, Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman!, the physicist detailed the womanising ways of his youth and set out his early technique of seducing “worthless bitches”.An amateur artist, he produced a portrait of “a beautiful blonde woman” during a life drawing class and named it after Marie Curie, saying: “Nobody thinks of Madame Curie as a woman, as feminine, with beautiful hair, bare breasts and all that. They only think of the radium part.”Mr Sharp brought up Feynman’s name when a staff member taking part in the Q\u0026ampA asked him how he would define genius. The chairman directed staff to watch a 1981 BBC Horizon documentary, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.Feynman, who died in 1988, was regarded in his day as a great wit and brilliant mind. He was a member of the team that developed the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos and taught at the California Institute of Technology.In 1986, sitting on the Presidential Commission into the Challenger space shuttle disaster, he conducted an impromptu experiment during a committee hearing that succinctly explained how the accident had occurred.A BBC spokesperson said: “At an internal staff event, the chairman was asked about how to measure genius. He responded by talking about the incredible talent within the BBC and recommended that staff watch the Richard Feynman Horizon interviews.“Describing someone as a genius is simply that - it’s not an endorsement of everything they may have said and done.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"freedom expression safety teachers should front centre batley","story":"The forthcoming Batley and Spen by-election gives the country a much-needed opportunity to have a long-delayed debate about freedom of speech in an age of religious intolerance. And if the parties want to avoid such a debate, the voters should force them to have it anyway.The constituency is home to Batley Grammar School, from which three teachers have been suspended following a religious education class in which pupils were shown cartoons of the prophet Muhammed that were initially published by the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The teachers were suspended and went into hiding, the school apologised – not to their staff but to angry parents who demanded the teachers’ dismissal.Charlie Hebdo paid a terrible price for offending sections of the Muslim community when Islamist terrorists brutally murdered 12 of its staff and injured 11 others in a raid in January 2015. So it’s understandable that the authorities treat such controversies like the one at Batley with sensitivity when they occur. The problem is that what appears to education and political leaders as sensitivity appears like capitulation and cowardice to the rest of us.Most Britons were first made aware of the threat of Islamic fundamentalism when, in 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa against the British novelist Salman Rushdie for alleged blasphemy.It was not the Left’s finest hour. I recall squirming with embarrassment as leading Labour Party figures performed intellectual contortions in an attempt to support freedom of expression while trying not to offend their Muslim electoral base. But it was clear which of those objectives mattered most to them.More than 30 years later the Labour Party is still refusing to accept (at least publicly) that there can be no compromise between western liberal values and religious fundamentalism.Britain took too long to consign to the history books the notion that iniduals could be punished by the law for blasphemy. For a significant proportion of the Muslim community, however, it is acceptable for a teacher who “disrespected” Islam to be hounded out of his job and sent into hiding for fear of his life.This is the story of three iniduals who have committed no crime, who are reportedly popular among their pupils, and who have been victimised and placed in fear of their lives by religious zealots. We should have been able to expect, at the very least, that their trade union would have done more to defend them.But even more depressing than the mealy-mouthed response of the main teachers’ union, the National Education Union (NEU), has been the response of politicians.The area’s former MP, Tracy Brabin – now the elected mayor of West Yorkshire – found it strangely difficult to respond to events. Her initial statement, issued on March 25, focussed on the “upset and offence this has caused” which was “understandable but it was also predictable.” Brabin was “pleased” that the school had recognised the depiction of Muhammad was “inappropriate” and that the school had apologised to the Muslim community. But a day later Brabin changed her tune, perhaps because her Conservative opponent in the mayoral election had issued a rather more forthright defence of the teachers than she had. Brabin now said: “No teacher should be facing intimidation or threats, there is no excuse for that.”Well, quite. Throughout this saga, local politicians, including Brabin, have sought to shut down the debate, criticising “Those who seek to fan the flames of ision”. We may assume that she means anyone who takes a stand in support of a teacher’s right to teach his pupils without pandering to the religious sensitivities of the local community.The by-election caused by Brabin’s resignation from parliament is a perfect opportunity for the political parties to have an honest, open debate about how serious we are about freedom of expression and whether any religion should have the right to regulate what is said in the classroom.It should be an opportunity for those who aspire to political office to take a stand, either in defence of liberties against the intolerance and extremism of religious fundamentalists, or to demand that freedom of speech can only extend as far as the religiously inclined are willing to allow it. The voters can be trusted to judge which approach they approve of.But we will not have that debate. Even as thousands of leafleters, canvassers and politicians traverse the constituency in the coming months, we will be told that to discuss such matters would be “disrespectful” and “isive”, even “racist”.We will not have it because such a debate is a bit awkward for our political leaders, who have better things to do than worry about basic human rights and who really don’t want to have uncomfortable arguments with people who, in normal circumstances, would be expected to vote for their party.In 1989 leading politicians, especially on the Labour side, worried too much about the Muslim vote and too little about the freedoms that make this country such an attractive home to Muslims escaping dictatorships in their own countries. In 2021, it’s in danger of making those same mistakes all over again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"knee jerk lockdowns not answer","story":"Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that deaths from Covid currently make up less than two per cent of all weekly fatalities. Yet despite the retreat of the pandemic in the face of a remarkably successful vaccination programme, the fear of a Covid upsurge continues to dominate debate around public health almost to the exclusion of all other considerations.The Prime Minister, who had been confident until recently that the “road map” to normality was on track, is now hedging his bets. Arguably the pace of the unlocking was already too cautious given the rapid decline in hospitalisations and fatalities – supposedly the two key metrics for deciding on the next steps.Where is any cost-benefit analysis of keeping these restrictions in place? Governments may legitimately take draconian action in the midst of a rapidly accelerating epidemic but it is unacceptable to continue with these constraints when the impact of the virus is both low and localised. Those who say the measures are justified in order to limit the risk of future infections need to ask themselves when this would end.Contingency plans that had been drawn up for dealing with pandemics were largely abandoned when the coronavirus hit. Lockdowns spread around the world from China and then Italy as hospitals came under massive pressure in some areas. But no one had ever carried out an assessment of the effect lockdowns would have on society beyond the public health benefit occasioned by keeping people apart.Fear of being blamed is at the heart of this. Dominic Cummings, the former No 10 aide, is promising to make startling revelations about what was done in the early stages of the pandemic when he appears before a select committee next week. As Clement Attlee once said of Harold Laski, a period of silence on his part would be welcome.Even though the most vulnerable people have been vaccinated, the Government’s concern appears to be the potential spread of a more virulent strain of Covid among the unvaccinated population, placing pressure once again on hospitals. But this should be addressed either by increasing capacity or developing triage procedures that allow people to be treated away from hospital.Moreover, why are the rules governing face coverings not being withdrawn? In America, where Covid rates are higher than here, Joe Biden has effectively bowed to the action already being taken by many US states and removed the requirement for vaccinated people to wear masks. Here, it is startling to see so few MPs in the Commons chamber, and for those who are there all to be masked, at a time when offices up and down the land are trying to get their employees to return to their desks. Vaccinated MPs who recently went into the chamber without a mask were upbraided by the Speaker who threatened to suspend the sitting. What example are our elected representatives setting? They are just projecting fear. If people want to carry on wearing masks, let them – but to insist that those who have been fully vaccinated must do so is perverse.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"netanyahu says hamas set back years gaza bombing","story":"Joe Biden, the US president, warned Israel that he expects to see a significant de-escalation in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, as pressure mounted on the Jewish state to call a ceasefire.Before the announcement, Mr Biden had been privately holding talks with Israel on an end to the violence and had resisted pressure from his Democrat party to adopt a tougher stance against the bombing campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 60 children.The United States also said on Wednesday that it would not support a United Nations Security Council draft resolution proposed by France calling for an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire, saying it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis. A source close to Mr Biden told the news website Axios that he was done kidding around and Israel needs to finish it.A senior Hamas official said on Wednesday that he expects Israel and Gaza militants to reach a ceasefire within a day or two that would end ten days of cross-border violence.There was no immediate sign of a lull in Gaza on Wednesday night, with Hamas continuing to fire rockets at Israel after Mr Biden\u0027s statement, though the volume of rockets has fallen significantly since last week.In northern Israel, the army fired artillery at the site of four rockets that had been launched from Lebanon towards Israel on Wednesday.It was the third time rockets had been fired from southern Lebanon since the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza erupted on May 10.Mr Biden\u0027s public admonishment came after Mr Netanyahu told foreign diplomats in Tel Aviv that he was prepared to conquer the Gaza Strip if rocket fire from Hamas continued.You can either conquer them, and that’s always an open possibility, or you can deter them, Mr Netanyahu said. “We are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say, we are not ruling out anything.When asked how much longer the conflict would last, Mr Netanyahu said he was not standing with a stopwatch and implied that it could continue for several more weeks.  Mr Netanyahu said he was determined to continue the military operation despite Mr Biden\u0027s intervention, though Israeli officials say they are assessing when is the right moment for a ceasefire.Health officials in Gaza said that 217 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, including 63 children, and more than 1,400 have been wounded.Israeli authorities say 12 people have been killed in Israel, including two children. The conflict continues to take a heavy toll on Palestinian children, with many of them already suffering PTSD from previous rounds of bombing over the past decade.In some cases, Palestinians have been buried under rubble for several hours before they are rescued. Israel insists it takes extreme care in avoiding civilian casualties.Human rights groups have warned that the conflict is deepening an already severe humanitarian crisis, with more than a dozen hospitals and clinics damaged by Israeli airstrikes, including the territory\u0027s only coronavirus testing lab.According to Oxfam, a number of water wells and pumping stations have also been damaged by Israeli strikes, potentially jeopardizing Palestinians\u0027 access to clean water.James Cleverly, the UK Middle East minister, said on Wednesday that London was supporting efforts to agree a ceasefire.“We are urging the parties to work with mediators towards an immediate ceasefire to prevent further loss of life and a worsening humanitarian situation,” he said.Israel said more than 3,450 rockets had been launched at it from Gaza, some falling short and others shot down by its Iron Dome air defences. It put the number of militants it has killed at about 160.Also on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had no involvement in an explosion that killed eight members of a Palestinian family on the first day of the conflict, and placed the blame on Hamas.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"taiwans covid stumble shows no country can open soon","story":"It had all been going so well. Until last weekend, the havoc of the pandemic was only evident at Taiwan’s borders, which were all but sealed to non-citizens and where arrivals had to endure strictly monitored quarantine for 14 days. Life inside the island bubble was otherwise normal for its 24 million people – children attended school, businesses thrived, restaurants were packed, the economy grew – until a series of small lapses in judgment allowed Covid to spread. In the past five days, a sudden surge of more than 1,200 infections after Taiwan successfully battled for 15 months to keep local transmissions below 100, is a cautionary tale that, until much of the world has been vaccinated, no country can afford to let its guard down. Once the poster child of pandemic responses, Taiwan faltered after it shortened quarantine for unvaccinated airline crews, and some tested positive after visiting bars. Then there was a spillover in a quarantine hotel which lodged both the airline crews and staycationers eager for a good deal, and by the time the leak was discovered, it had swept through the local chapter of a Lion Clubs International. Among those infected was a former president in his 60s, now called the ‘Lion King’, who contact tracers found had visited a “tea shop” in the capital, Taipei – a euphemism for premises where older men are intimately attended to by hostesses of a similar age, who may or may not actually pour tea. By now, the virus had well and truly taken hold, and the news knocked Taiwan’s public out of a creeping sense of complacency.The country can still pull itself back from the brink of a widespread epidemic.In a recent tweet, former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings praised Taiwan’s overall pandemic response and accused “SW1” of being “totally hostile to learning from East Asia.”The island is now in a semi-lockdown. Schools are closed for for two weeks and the public has been urged to remain at home, while the effects of panic buying can be seen across Taipei. It can still show how mistakes can be acknowledged, rectified and learned from. But its predicament has wider implications. As the main manufacturer of semiconductors - which are used in everything from electric cars to smartphones - moving into a full lockdown could create a bottleneck in global supply chains. And, crucially, if a pandemic poster child like Taiwan can succumb to a widespread outbreak, it reveals how far every country is from the finishing line. The US and UK have led the way in vaccine rollouts, but there can be no global normality or return to regular business and leisure travel while the rest of the world lags behind. Taiwan, like much of East and Southeast Asia, is struggling to inoculate its people because of the crunch in global vaccines supplies. Less than 1 per cent of its population has received a jab and it has appealed for a fairer international distribution. Like much of Asia, it performed well in the first phase of the pandemic, only to be hit by variants from countries that initially failed to curb the spread.The British variant has fuelled Covid-19 in Taiwan. Neighbouring Singapore, despite reaching one third of its population with at least one dose, has shut schools as the Indian variant races through the community.It’s a cycle that will be repeated until the world achieves the required level of immunity, and a timely reminder that no country can defeat the pandemic alone.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners urge government give 15bn","story":"NewsCampaigners urge Government to give £.bn supply ships deal to British workersEXCLUSIVE: Ministers have vowed to relaunch the competition for the Fleet Solid Support vessels this springmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY NewsThe tender to build three Fleet Solid Support ships is expected to be issued this spring\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions General Secretary Ian Waddell told the Mirror: If the Government fails to design and build these ships in Britain it will be a dereliction in its duty to British voters. “Now that we have left the EU it is inconceivable that a foreign-owned shipyard from a competitor country should play a leading role in the construction of these strategically important vessels. “The Government talked a lot about levelling-up in the elections and itaposs now time to put its money where its mouth is.  “These ships will drive regional economies pumping money into the high street and securing well-paid, skilled jobs for a generation. “If built in Britain, the Treasury will see a huge percentage ed through tax and national insurance from workers and companies throughout the UK supply chain, including British steel. “British taxpayers will not want to see that benefit go to Spain or anywhere . The ,-tonne Fleet Solid Support vessels, which will be part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, will resupply Royal Navy warships, including the £.bn Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, with food, ammunition and explosives.  The competition for the contract was initially offered worldwide, with companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea shortlisted, along with a UK consortium. The tendering process was halted suddenly in November  – raising hopes the terms could be reset to boost British firmsapos chances of winning the deal. The Ministry of Defence triggered fresh dismay last August when foreign companies were invited to take part in early plans to build the vessels. But in October, Mr Wallace delighted campaigners by officially designating them as “warships” – meaning they can be built in Britain without allowing overseas firms to bid. GMB union national officer Ross Murdoch said: The restart of the procurement process is not just needed – it is long overdue.  “Ministers must end the delays that have dogged this programme because our yards are crying out for work. “Ministers talk about supporting UK shipbuilding, but they are setting UK yards against each other. “Despite the grand words about making the UK into a ‘shipbuilding superpower,’ there is still no requirement that the bulk of the work will be fulfilled domestically. That’s why we are calling for the Government to favour a collaborative approach which makes use of the specialist skills in yards across the UK and deliver the jobs and apprenticeships for the next generation. This £.bn order is critical for the future of shipbuilding in the UK. “Our proud industry can have a bright future, but onlyministers do the right thing and back our yards.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnIan WaddellEuropean UnionRolls Royce PLCThe TreasuryBAE Systems plcGMB unionMinistry of DefenceRoyal NavyHarland and WolffArmed forcesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"locked down families take up","story":"NewsLocked down families take-up outdoor hobbies to boost health and wellbeing - pollA survey for the Angling Trust reveals fishing was one of the pastimes which saw a surge in popularitymirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video pandemic-hooks-people-into-fishing-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:kYQhblK,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Some  months after the first lockdown, the public are relishing being among nature, with % reporting feeling happier and “enjoying better wellbeing overall when spending time in green spaces”. An online OnePoll survey of , people this month found a boom in numbers taking to the outdoors. Two in five had done gardening or tended an allotment during the crisis, % had been cycling, % went running and % went hiking or birdwatching. Some % of those quizzed said they spent more time outdoors to improve physical health or take exercise, while % said it was to help their mental health and wellbeing.  Forty-one per cent said a “change of scenery has given me an escape from staying at home”, % said they “needed the ‘me time’” and a quarter wanted “time away from screens” such as Zoom meetings or smartphones. Fishing benefited from a rise in demand, with the Environment Agency issuing ,, freshwater licences in England in the year to April, compared with , in the previous  months – an increase of %. The Angling Trustaposs head of participation Clive Copeland said: Itaposs great to see the surging popularity of fishing and other outdoor pursuits continuing as we head into summer with people becoming much more engaged with nature and the benefits that participating in new activities provides. “Weaposre hearing reports that people are becoming more mindful of the environmental impact of outdoor activities and this, coupled with a willingness to try new experiences, is reflected in the types of sustainable activities that are becoming more popular.”Fishing fan Beverly Clford, a social media influencer with , Instagram followers, said: “Angling has seen a huge boost since the pandemic with people ing to fishing, and also coming into the sport for the first time. “We’ve seen a lot of women coming into the sport during this time and enjoying the many benefits of angling, such as reconnecting with nature, positive affect on mental health, as well as being a low-impact form of exercise and a great way to make new friends.” The Agency seized on the figures to trumpet the benefits of connecting with nature – a key plank of the Governmentaposs plan to cut infection numbers by encouraging people to enjoy fresh air and be outdoors. Its fisheries partnerships manager Heidi Stone said: “Fishing has benefited the mental health of hundreds of thousands of people in the past year and is a great option for people who are looking for a long-term connection with nature.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock claims travel rules","story":"NewsMatt Hancock claims travel rules are \"crystal clear\" despite days of confusionMinisters have given six dferent - and often contradictory - versions of the advice on travel to amber list countries.

Finally, Boris Johnson waded back in at Prime Ministeraposs Questions to say that people should not travel to amber list countries for holidays.

If you look at what the PM said last week, what I said at the weekend, what I said in the House on Monday, what the PM said at lunchtime today - weaposve been absolutely crystal clear, he said. You should not go to an amber or red list country on holiday. You should only go in exceptional circumstances. He suggested as examples that you could travel to visit a very ill family member or to go to a funeral.

Ministers will wait until June  to announce whether step four of Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap can go ahead as planned on June . Under the plan, all rules limiting social contact are due to be scrapped and businesses that are still mothballed like nightclubs will open up. But the Health Secretary said it was too early to say at the moment whether the last step of unlocking could take place amid fears that the spread of the Indian Covid iant could derail lting the last lockdown rules. Nearly , cases of the Indian strain have been identied, pitting the UK in a race against time to vaccinate the public to prevent its spread.  Mr Hancock told a No press conference: We have set out that we will take step four not before June  and we will give a decision on that on June , using all the information we have up until then. Clearly, every day we are getting more information, getting more information about how many are in hospital in the areas where there are hotspots of this new iant and we are getting more scientic information. Scientists are expecting greater clarity on how infectious the new strain is within days. SAGE experts have warned it could be up to % as transmissible as the Kent iant, which ripped through the UK in December and January. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said: I think scientists are sure that this virus is more transmissible than the strain that it is beginning to replace, which is the old Kent B. strain.  The million dollar question is how much more transmissible - we donapost have that yet. We have a credible range that goes from a few percent more transmissible through to % more transmissible - I think most people feel it is going to be somewhere in the middle... but it is just too early. The best estimate that I can give you is that the data will begin to firm up some time next week and I think next week will be the first time when we have a ranging shot at what the transmissibility increase is. Prof Van Tam said the spread of the new iant is not inevitable and it can be slowed down through cautious behaviour.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MPBreaking News"},{"url":null,"title":"race report chair says religious","story":"NewsRace report chair says religious minorities set for Oxbridge as theyre good at ritualDr Tony Sewell argued religious pupils from ethnic minorities are very good at \"having dinners and whatever and standing up and down and putting your hands on your head\"mirrorShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDr Tony Sewell was behind the widely criticised race report commissioned by Boris Johnson \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dr Tony Sewell chaired the PMaposs Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities - which was behind a report earlier this year which was widely accused of diminishing the impact of systemic racism in Britain, and of putting a positive spin on slavery. Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered by racists in , said the report gave a green light to racists. Today, Dr Sewell suggested religion is part of the immigrant optimism which can lead to higher attainment among some ethnic groups at school, adding it can also help with discipline. Addressing MPs on the education select committee, Dr Sewell said he did not agree with stereotypes that ethnic minority pupils are likely to feel isolated at Oxford as they are not accustomed to rituals. The reportaposs conclusion, which lined up with the view of Mr Johnsonaposs government, was that geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion all impact le chances more than racism. When asked whether religion had an input in disparities in pupil attainment, Dr Sewell told MPs: I think we can see that it can be a positive effect. I do think particularly from ethnic minorities.  Sometimes thereaposs stereotypes around the fact that weaposre not used to rituals. If you send an ethnic minority pupil to Oxford University, theyaposre going to kind of feel isolated. Culturallyyou come from a religious background you are used to ritualistic backgrounds. So, having dinners and whatever and standing up and down and putting your hands on your head - all those kinds of things that you would do in a context that might be dficult - I find that in fact weaposre very good at that. Discipline as well - it helps in discipline. So I can see how, in a very positive way, religion is part of, almost, that immigrant optimism. Martyn Oliver, a commissioner for the race report and chief executive of Outwood Grange Academies Trust, said: I think that equally being a part of a community cohesive group is hugely important. MPs on the education select committee questioned the commissioners as part of their inquiry into left-behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  During the hearing, Dr Sewell suggested that state schools should have teachers who are dedicated to getting pupils into Oxbridge and other top universities from early on, like in the private sector. He said: Maybe itaposs shared within an academy or whatever, but really working with those young people from upstream, beginning to build that aspiration with them, but particularly with their families. Thataposs another intervention that you work with the families to understand the real value of higher education and we think that would work particularly with white pupils from poor backgrounds. Dr Sewell said that in some private schools - where they have dedicated staff who talk to pupils about Oxbridge early - children have a real academic confidence and know about the colleges by Year . Why should that just be for one group  Maybe we have those kinds of teachers, or that kind of resource, in our state schools, he added.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsMore OnDoreen LawrenceBoris JohnsonStephen LawrenceUnited NationsOxford UniversityEducationSchoolsPoliticsRacism"},{"url":null,"title":"youngsters job hopes crushed coronavirus","story":"NewsYoungsters job hopes crushed by coronavirus pandemic, warns youth expertThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs outlined recommendations to help young people battle back from the crisismirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY NewsA report lays bare the dficulties facing youngsters as Britain emerges from the crisis\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A cross-party  of MPs and peers reveals “young people are in dire need of support at almost every juncture” as the country battles back from the crisis. Publishing its aposSummary of Generation Covid: The Economic Impact of Covid- on young people in the United Kingdomapos report, Westminsteraposs All-Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs said that “in addition to job losses, educational disruption and financial pressures, young people have also experienced increased family strain, heightened anxiety and exacerbated mental health issues as a result of the pandemic”. The issues were “inexorably interlinked” and “further compounded by the overall uncertainty of employment prospects for young people in the future”, the APPG warns. Chairman and Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: “This latest report shows that young people as a generation have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  “Young people are in dire need of support at almost every juncture. “Investing in the future of young people not only helps to clear a path of recovery for them but also for the country, as a strong youth workforce with a bright economic future will feed into and benefit from the UK economy as a whole. “There is real potential to create an efficient and constructive cycle of education, employment and support for young people, and now is the time to set it in motion.” The group calls for businesses to be given financial incentives to keep on youngsters after placement schemes finish. It also wants a “dedicated youth strategy” to be unveiled, “providing long-term, stable funding for universal youth service provision”. Youngsters should also be involved in policy decisions which affect them, it says. They should also be taught about managing finances as part of the National Curriculum from age +.  Lessons would include “advice on financial products, budgeting, and living costs”. It also calls on ministers to axe plans to scrap the £-a-week hike in Universal Credit. YMCA chief executive Denise Hatton said: “Covid- has inflicted serious damage on young people. “Not only has it left them isolated, anxious and fearful of the future, it has created and exacerbated financial hardships and crushed employment opportunities. “Wrap-around support is needed in order to restore young people’s confidence and ultimately strengthen their educational and employment potential.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationJob lossesMental healthBritish economyPoliticsRedundancyCoronavirusYouth Service Cuts"},{"url":null,"title":"your utterly unhelpful guide travel","story":"NewsYour utterly unhelpful guide to travel this summer from  dferent Tory ministersIts time for a summer holiday!

Wait, no we arenapost. Or are we  Maybe a bit. Foreign travel reopened on Monday - and so did the floodgates of confusion from Tory ministers. Brits can go to green list countries without having to quarantine on their . But apart from Portugal, almost the entire green list is impractical or impossible to visit. So reports have emerged of thousands flying out to amber list nations - despite the fact theyaposll have to quarantine at home for  days when they get back to the UK. So what is the governmentaposs advice on all this You shouldnapost go to amber nations at all. But seeing friends and family is okay. But onlyitaposs not a holiday. It has to be essential. But some people think holidays ARE essential. But actually donapost travel abroad at all this year - itaposs dangerous. All these are statements that have come from the mouths of Tory ministers in the last  hours. The actual rules are like this. Since Monday  May, itaposs no longer been illegal to make a non-essential journey overseas. But all travel, green amber or red, comes with testing on yourwhich you must pay for. If you travel to an amber country, you must isolate in your home for  days on . For a red country you must isolate in a £, mandatory hotel. The government is telling people to, please, not go on holiday to amber nations. But itaposs not illegal.  And that leaves rather a bit gap in the policy. Which has been filled by a iety of Tory ministers.At Prime Ministeraposs Questions Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: The Government has lost control of the messaging. He added: Since the Government loosened travel restrictions,  flights a day are going to amber list countries and travel agents are reporting surges in holiday bookings to those countries. So what have ministers said to calm this all down  Hereaposs their handy handy advice... aposNo travel to the amber listapos Matt Hancock , Health Secretary, told the Commons: The official Government advice is very clear that people should not travel to amber or red-list countries or territories.People should not travel to amber-list countries for a holiday. aposBut you can visit friends and familyapos George Eustice , Environment Secretary, told the BBC: The reason we have the amber list is there will be reasons why people feel they need to travel - either to visit family or indeed to visit friends.They can travel to those countries but they then have to observe quarantine when theyand have two tests after ing. So people can travel to those areas, yes, but they then have to subject themselves to quarantine requirements on their . Prime Minister Boris Johnson then intervened, saying: I think itaposs very important for people to grasp what an amber list country is: it is not somewhere where you should be going on holiday, let me be very clear about that.Andpeople do go to an amber list country - they absolutely have to for some pressing family or urgent business reason -they have to go to an amber list country, then please bear in mind that you will have to self-isolate, youaposll have to take tests and do your passenger locator form and all the rest of it, but you also have to self-isolate for  days when you get back. And that period of self-isolation, that period of quarantine, will be enforced with fines of up to £,. The PM later insisted the position was very clear and people should only travel to an amber list country for some extreme circumstance, such as the serious illness of a family member. You should not be going to an amber list country on holiday, the Prime Minister told MPs at PMQs. Simon Hart, Welsh Secretary, told Times Radio: “Some people might think a holiday is essential. I can think of a quite a lot of people who do think that.“But itaposs about common sense weaposre good at common sense. Weaposre good at common sense as a population, and, and, and I think that, I think it is absolutely clear what Matt and what the PM have in mind here. “So I donapost think we can again create a confusion where none exists.” aposActually, no, travel is DANGEROUS and you shouldnapost go abroad this year at allapos Lord Bethell, Health Minister, told the House of Lords: Segregation is unbelievably dficult during travel. It is very dficult to segregate amber list and red list passengers on a plane, train or ferry.Within an airport it is very dficult to segregate people, because of the physical proximity. That is why travelling is dangerous, why we tell people not to travel and why, when people do travel, we tell them to isolate. Travelling is dangerous, and that is not news to us or to the people who get on those planes in the first place. The ultimate sanction here is that, particularly as we go into the summer, we tell people: travelling is not for this year. Please stay in this country. aposBusiness, care and funerals are fine - but no holsapos Skills Minister Gillian Keegan told Times Radio: What weaposre saying to people is, the amber list countries are there for a reason.Theyaposre there so that you can travel for business you can travel for particular situations you have funerals,thereaposs some specic care issues or that in your family that you know there are some exceptions.

But her group leader Laura was on hand to give Maureen the supportive push she needed and she eventually joined in January . Maureen added: Laura made me feel comfortable, and it started from there.”  After going to her first meeting, determined Maureen cut out takeaways and biscuits and swapped out foods like white bread for healthier alternatives. She also swapped jars of sauce from the supermarket for homemade versions, so she knew exactly what was going into them. As she stuck to a healthier eating pattern, she says her husband and daughter began to make healthier choices too. Before going to Slimming World, Maureen admits she did eat unhealthily. However, she has now learned more about nutrition and is still able to enjoy meals while making healthier choices.  Since starting on her weight loss journey just  months ago, Maureen has shed an incredible st lbs and now weighs st lbs. Itaposs a whole person really, when you think about it, she said. She has also dropped seven dress sizes and can now fit into size  clothes. Of course, it hasnapost always been plain sailing, and Maureen has had her setbacks along the way. Last year she had to have two operations on her leg which put her on bed rest for more than  weeks. Luckily, her husband was on hand to help, making her healthy breakfasts in bed and using Slimming World recipes to cook her dinner every day. Now, Maureen is feeling more confident than ever and is looking forward to le getting back to normal after lockdown. She said: I’ve got a -year-old daughter and we’re so looking forward to going out shopping together. Iaposm so excited to go out for a bite to eat, and just feel comfortable enough. Iaposm happier again.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSlimming WorldWeight loss success stories"},{"url":null,"title":"touching simple question meghan asked","story":"NewsTouching and simple question Meghan asked before entering relationship with Prince HarryBefore the engagement, the fairytale wedding, and becoming a parent, Meghan asked her friend a simple question to make sure Harry was the perfect matchmirrorShareCommentsByLaurie Churchman:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBefore deciding to enter a relationship with Prince Harry, Meghan asked their mutual friend a simple question \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

With the birth of their son Archie, another baby on the way, and a new chapter ahead as they forge their futures in the USA, the couple have much to celebrate.The pair had a star-studded fairytale wedding on May , , getting married in St Georgeaposs Chapel, Windsor Castle.They had been introduced by a mutual friend - whose identity remains unknown - in July . But before deciding to enter a relationship with the prince, Meghan asked her pal a simple question about Harry. She wanted to know whether he would be kind.  In a BBC interview at the time of their engagement, Meghan said: Because I’m from the States, you don’t grow up with the same understanding of the royal family. I didn’t know much about him, so the only thing that I had asked [my friend] when she said that she wanted to set us up, was, ‘Well is he nice ’ aposCausehe wasn’t kind, it just didn’t seem like it would make sense.  The two apparently met for a drink and hit it off immediately. Meghan explained: “I think very quickly into that we said, ‘Well what are we doing tomorrow  We should meet again. They went on a second date before Harry asked Meghan to join him on a trip to Africa a month later.  He would go on to propose in secret before announcing their engagement in November . A few days after their wedding anniversary, Harry and Meghan will appear in the first episode of the princeaposs Apple TV+ mental health documentary series with Oprah Winfrey. It follows the coupleaposs bombshell Oprah interview earlier this year, in which the couple opened up about their decision to leave the Royal Family for the US. Meghan, who is expecting a daughter in the summer, spoke of the intense pressures, and claimed she had been left feeling suicidal. She said racist comments were made to Harry about the potential skin colour of their then-unborn child Archie, and the couple said a Royal Family member had expressed concerns over how dark their sonaposs skin might be.  In the interview Harry also spoke of his troubled relationship with his father, saying Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls after the coupleaposs shock break from the Royal Family. Prince Harry recently gave another explosive podcast interview in which he explained his decision to leave.He discussed his struggles growing up in the spotlight, saying it had felt like a mixture between The Truman Show and being in a zoo.  He told the Armchair Expert Podcast he would think: I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mum. How am I ever going to settle down and have a we and family when I know itaposs going to happen again. And he touched on the effect of Prince Charlesaposs distant parenting style, saying he wanted to break the cycle of suffering when it comes to his own children. He told host and actor Dax Shepard: When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAppleBBCDax ShepardPrince HarryOprah WinfreyPrince Charles, Prince of WalesApple TVDocumentariesBabiesMarriageRoyal FamilyMental healthCelebrity love livesCelebrity weddingsParenting"},{"url":null,"title":"23 areas more half covid","story":"NewsThe  areas where more than half of Covid cases now Indian iant - full listAn official briefing identies Indian coronavirus iant hotspots including Bolton in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, and Sefton, and two London boroughs are also moving up the rankingsmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-fails-rule-out-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:voZxFs,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A full list of places where the strain is taking the lead in new infections in the period May - is contained in a Public Health Englandtechnical briefing. The report presented to SAGE identies virus hotspots, with Bolton in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, Sefton in Merseyside and Bedford, Bedfordshire leading the tables as authorities target the locations with surge testing. The most recent publicly available figures show  cases in Bolton where the iant makes up .% of cases,  in Blackburn with Darwen where it makes up  ,  in Seftonand  in Bedford . Also creeping up the rankings are Nottingham, South Northampton, and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Hounslow, according to the PHE figures. Boris Johnson is under fire after it emerged last night that more than  plane-loads of passengers had travelled into the UK from the virus-devastated country since it had been added to the governmentaposs travel aposred list.aposScroll down for the full list...The measure came into force on April , but was not accompanied by a ban on direct flights, with  touching down in the three-and-a-half weeks since, analysis by LBC found.The Prime Minister has faced criticism for not shutting the border to flights from India sooner as the new iant emerged that is being presented as a potential threat to Englandaposs fourth and final unlocking date.

The government has hastened the UKaposs vaccine rollout in hopes of curbing the iantaposs spread in Britain, expanding first jabs to people aged over  this week and ramping up efforts to give second doses to the most vulnerable groups.This week Matt Hancock told the Commons there were now five or more cases in  council areas, and said there had been a % increase in confirmed cases of the iant over the last five days. He told MPs there were now , confirmed cases of the iant in the UK, adding it was now the dominant strain of the virus in Bolton as well as Blackburn with Darwen, and its incidence was rising in all age groups. Bedford in Bedfordshire was also becoming a hotspot, the Health Secretary also told MPs. That means in some areas it has now outstripped the previously dominant Kent strain, which first emerged in south-east England before Christmas before spreading through the UK and to parts of the rest of the world. Mr Hancock claimed most people in hospital in the hotspot areas had been eligible for a jab but had chosen not to have it. He urged anyone not sure whether to get their vaccine to look at whataposs happening in Bolton. Nearly million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine in the UK, according to official figures. Case numbers have risen very slightly in recent weeks, with , new positive tests reported Tuesday, May , as infection numbers remain at levels similar to last Augustaposs.

Boustead’s Bar in Carlisle, Cumbria, was a favourite haunt for men working in Gretna during the Great War, who would head to the city by train after work. Evening sht workers were so desperate to get to the pub before closing, they would even bribe the train driver to get there in plenty of time. It soon became clear the city - and Britain - had a serious drink problem. In , David Lloyd George, who was Minister for Munitions before becoming Prime Minister, declared: “We are fighting Germans, Austrians and drink, and so far as I can see the greatest of these deadly foes is drink.”  Carlilse couldn’t cope with the drunken disorder, which led to poor productivity at the munitions factory. Horried by the drunks, Bramwell Evens, a Methodist minister, said of the situation in Carlilse: “Scenes of the most nauseating and degrading character became a common occurrence. “Men fought like beasts fierce fights raged around the doors of the public houses. “The diminished police force were unable to cope with the situation. Almost every alley was littered with prostrate drunken men.  “The main thoroughfare of Carlisle was bedlam and the ing trains to Gretna, with their living freight of cursing, vomiting, filthy-mannered men, are memories that cause one to shudder.” It led the Government to crack down on Britain’s boozers and a decision to nationalise them in the State Management Pubs scheme. Now, as the country celebrates going back into our favourite boozers for the first time since lockdown, Historic England has published the first comprehensive study of the ‘Carlilse Experiment’ which changed our pubs forever. Before the transformation, pubs were “overcrowded spaces with small areas or snugs capable of hiding misbehaviour, while back doors allowed iniduals to enter and leave unnoticed and provided a means by which illegal sales might be carried out after hours,” Historic England’s report - ‘Countering the ‘deadliest of foes’: Public houses of the Central Control Board and the State Management Scheme - - says.  In July , the Government brought in new measures to public houses which resemble the boozers we know and love today. Comfy seating was added, along with tables and chairs for dining. Punters were encouraged to have a pie or sandwich with their drinks to line their stomachs and board games and newspapers were introduced so people would take their time. Advertising was removed from the outside of Carlisle’s pubs with only simple name signs allowed.  Bar staff were encouraged to throw drunks out from pubs, turn away prostitutes, chasers were banned and ‘no spirit Saturdays’ were introduced from February . Family-orientated activities and spaces were also created, such as bowling greens, and toilets were provided at some venues for the first time. “It was a social project,” Anne-Marie Knowles, curator of the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, said. “They were trying to change people’s behaviour and get them to go out on an evening and have a nice time socialising instead of binge drinking.  “A lot of people in Carlisle won’t realise just how important a part the city played in developing the drinking culture in the pubs we have here today.” One of the pubs, The Pheasant, on Church Street, created ‘A Working Girls’ Café’ on the first floor which sold cheap hot meals at lunchtime and was very popular with local mill girls. There were also reading and writing rooms on both the first and second floors. Other rules meant pubs had to stick to included strict opening hours on weekdays .am-pm and .-pm and on Sundays .pm-.pm and -pm.  Credit was refused and spirits were served in large glasses so they could be diluted with water. Even buying rounds was banned. Carlilse was the main focus of the experiment but it also reached Enfield Lock in Middlesex, now Greater London, and Cromarty Firth in Northern Scotland. By the end of the war the scheme had proved so successful that the Government decided to keep the pubs in state ownership and extend the programme of public-house reform further.  Under the direction of architect Harry Redfern, many of the pubs retained for nationalisation were rebuilt and redesigned. No two designs were quite the same and the architect went to great s to make sure locals’ needs were catered for. There was a revolution of his ‘New Model Inn’,  of which were built in the wider Carlisle district, and which had a huge influence of the design of pubs across the country. The Apple Tree on Lowther Street in Carlisle was the first of the new improved public houses built under the scheme.  Located on the street corner, it was easy for the authorities to monitor who was entering and leaving with no access possible through back doors, and the layout was considered innovative, catering for combinations of genders and classes in separate rooms. Dylan Mckenzie, general manager at The Apple Tree, said: “The story of the Apple Tree is part of Carlisle’s rich heritage, and we’re thrilled to be throwing open our doors once again for customers to enjoy themselves in the surroundings of this special building.” But the scheme was constantly being called into question by the government, who felt there was no longer a need for it after the war. It was eventually shut down by Ted Heath’s Tory government in  and the pubs were sold off.

Conservative Home Secretary Reginald Maudling told the House of Commons: “We should be clear that this experiment was never intended to be an experiment to determine whether the State can successfully run a liquor business.” It had served its purpose. While our locals might still get a bit rowdy on a Friday and Saturday night, the experiment changed the beloved British pub for the better. And we can all raise a glass to that.

Penn had pinned the blame on the boy’s mum Kelly Ann Cope, , who defended herself saying I couldnapost kill a spider. Penn initially claimed to medics the boy had suffered a choking episode but he died two days later in hospital. The dad showed no emotion as he was found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow of culpable homicide and a separate charge of assault to Kalebaposs severe injury and danger of le.He had originally been charged with murder and a further allegation of attempted murder.  He will be sentenced next month. Kalebaposs mum told jurors in evidence Penn woke her up on the morning of his death asking her to phone . Miss Cope said: “He said the wean wasn’t breathing. I was in bed and Kaleb was in his arms at the bedroom door.” Prosecutor Erin Campbell asked how Kaleb was and she replied: “I put my hand on his heart and it was still beating but I couldn’t understand why he wasn’t breathing. “His eyes were rolling to the back of his head.”Miss Cope said she could not watch as mercy crews tended to Kaleb and rushed him to hospital.It was put to Miss Cope that she knew about Kaleb choking on prune juice as she said it during the  call. Miss Cope was asked how she knew and she replied: “Brian came in and I asked what happened and he said Kaleb choked on prune juice but I didn’t know more about it.” She later added: “He said he patted his back and said he stfened up, his body went flimsy then realised he wasn’t breathing.” Miss Cope said she was beside Penn when he told medical staff that he dropped Kaleb on a changing mat weeks before. It was also put to the mum that she told police in a statement that Kaleb had a bump on the back of his head. Miss Cope said she had not known him to hit his head. Miss Campbell asked: “Did you forget or deliberately not tell them ” Miss Cope said: “I did forget as my head was discombobulated as my thoughts were to see my son.” Miss Cope denied causing Kalebaposs injuries stating: I wouldnapost harm anyone, I couldnapost kill a spider. Nurse Carol McNeill earlier told jurors that she spoke to Penn after Kaleb arrived at the hospital. Mrs McNeill stated: He said that he had been feeding the baby and there had been a choking episode. Hehad vomited, but that it was not vomit. Consultant neuropathologist professor Colin Smith, , who examined Kalebaposs brain after his death, gave evidence at the trial. He said: [Kalebaposs injuries] are only seen in a setting of severe trauma, this is either a fall from a height or road traffic incident. Prof Smith also claimed there was evidence of previous bleeding to the brain dated seven to  days before Kalebaposs death. He was then asked: We may hear evidence that three weeks before his death, he may have been dropped from about  inches to the ground. Was a fall like that likely to have caused the injuries to the brain  Prof Smith replied: “It is possible.” Miss Campbell asked: Would it be clear the level of brain injury you identied in this case would have led Kaleb to be unresponsive  Prof Smith replied: Thataposs my opinion. Penn - represented by QC Brian McConnachie - did not give evidence during the trial, but had lodged an incrimination claiming Miss Cope was responsible. Sentence was deferred until next month for background reports by judge Lord Weir who remanded Penn in custody meantime.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnDaily RecordHospitalsCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"doctor makes miracle recovery covid","story":"NewsDoctor makes miracle recovery from Covid after saying final goodbyes to family on phoneDr Anushua Gupta, , was admitted to hospital with coronavirus on April  last year and after four days her condition had deteriorated and she ended up in a comamirrorShareCommentsByEmily ChudyWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsShe was in a coma for two months \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dr Anushua Gupta, , was admitted to hospital on April  last year and after four days her condition had deteriorated and she needed to be ventilated. She ended up in a coma for two months, needing a le support machine as she only got worse. After a long and arduous battle where her husband was told she may not survive she eventually began to pull through and recover. Recalling her terrying ordeal the GP from Cheshire said: Deep inside I was thinking that thataposs probably the end for me now. Inside I was thinking Iaposm not going to be able to see my daughter, Iaposm not going to be able to see her entire adult le, I wonapost be able to live my le with my husband. It was terrible.  After being fully vaccinated and on the road to recovery she said she wants to share her story in order to tell people to take heed as weaposre not out of the woods yet. She said she was first infected during the initial wave of the pandemic last year, quickly becoming so ill she started to experience hallucinations due to low oxygen levels. She was transferred to the ICU for ventilation, requiring a medically-induced coma with no guarantee of survival. My worst fears were coming true she said. I telephoned my husband Ankur, and asked to see our daughter Ariana - just  months old at that time - on a video call, as I thought that I would never get to see her again. At that time no one was allowed any visitors, so all communications were over the phone. I was petried. I just thought I needed to see her before I went on the ventilator, I didnapost know I would ever see them again.  Dr Gupta was in the coma for two months, requiring a le support machine as her condition worsened. She said: My husband was requested to come in to discuss further treatment because I was just not making much progress. At that point it was looking like I would probably not survive, a lot of the doctors are probably going to say itaposs a miracle you are alive. It was really dficult for him to be told that possibly your spouse, your le partner, may not survive. Luckily after a few days I started to pull through, I started making improvements. She added: Now I just appreciate le in a completely dferent way. Every dayaposs a blessing.Dr Gupta was one of the first patients in the UK to be treated for coronavirus with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , special equipment that completely takes over theof the lungs and is seen as a last resort option. Dr Gupta explained that while the ECMO treatment saved her le, her road to recovery was very dficult. When I woke up from the coma was I realised that I had no voice. I couldnapost speak, I couldnapost swallow, I couldnapost move my arms, my legs. I felt like I was paralysed, she said. Being in the ICU can be very traumatising, you know when you wake up to all these machines... but I got immense support from every department, and every aspect of the team. I had so much family support from my husband, my daughter... when you come home you need that family support, because it just keeps you going. Dr Gupta said that she has now ed to some of the things that bring her joy, including cooking and singing with Ariana, who is now two-and-a-half. My motive is not to provide anyone with a scare story or a horror story, but itaposs really to let people know that this virus is very good at mutating and changing. I think people should take heed still weaposre not out of the woods yet.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"ex council leader tells grenfell","story":"NewsEx-council leader tells Grenfell inquiry hes desperately sorry for victimsNicholas Paget-Brown told an inquiry systemic failure had occurred and the Tory is now very nervous about high-rises after the utterly, utterly terrible blaze in West London in June  claimed  livesmirrorShareCommentsByHelen William:,  MAY NewsFormer leader of Kensington and Cha council Nicholas Paget-Brown outside his Cha home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The blaze in West London in June  claimed  lives. Mr Paget-Brown said: “I was very proud to be leader of Kensington and Cha. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  I am desperately sorry for everybody who was in the tower on the morning of June . I will never forget what I saw. It was utterly, utterly terrible. “The memorial to those who lost their lives and lost everything and have had their lives ruined must be the work this inquiry is doing to find out what happened.  I am so sorry for all of them.” The inquiry has heard Grenfell was clad in a polyethylene core between aluminium composite material .

Recently, Harry, , revealed how the pair even met up in secret for a date in a supermarket as they worked at keeping their growing bond under the radar.After six months of dating, the news was finally revealed that Prince Harry was in a relationship with Meghan - propelling them into the royal spotlight. In these early stages of their relationship, Meghan spoke about how they dealt with the attention while still getting to know one another - and possibly hinted at a change of direction for the couple - which ultimately came when they quit as senior royals in early . Meghan told Vanity Fair: Weaposre a couple. Weaposre in Love. Iaposm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell - but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. The relationship continued to blossom and in May , they got married in Windsor Castle before welcoming their first born, Archie almost exactly a year later.  Today, Meghan and Harry celebrate their third wedding anniversary. The couple married during a glittering ceremony on May ,  and are likely to mark their milestone privately at their Calornian home.

Then there have been times when I’ve had crushes on certain girls, only for those crushes to die upon finding out about her past or current ­experiences. Long story short, I keep searching for someone to share something special with, only to find that all I can be is just another notch on someone’s bedpost.I understand that jealousy is normal, and I definitely have insecurities.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  But I’d rather live with my insecurities than be with a girl who’s not a virgin, because I won’t be happy and, by extension, she won’t be either. I would be doing a disservice to myself and her by “settling”, especially considering she would most likely be a dream girl for someone . So, here I am, by myself, wonderingthere’s any chance at all that I’ll find what I’m looking for. Is there hope  Or am I on a wild goose chase here  Coleen saysOK, what’s behind this need  It doesn’t sound like it’s for religious reasons.It is almost like being a virgin is the top priority for you and crucial factors like character, personality, chemistry, passion and friendship are way down the list. I’d suggest you need to think about what a relationship is and adjust your priorities and expectations. You could meet a virgin tomorrow and she might be wrong for you in every other way, so the relationship would fail.

But I promise, when you meet the right girl and feel comfortable with each other, and the chemistry is there, you won’t feel intimidated. If she’s right for you, she’ll understand and sex will happen naturally – and it will be a lot of fun learning! You’re overthinking what will make you happy and you’re  steps ahead of yourself. I believe what will make you happy is to find a girl you connect with and fall in love with, regardless of whether she’s a virgin or not.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnColeen NolanRelationships"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park. All the situations in the advert show the kind of fantastic projects those who play The National Lottery are helping to fund – from community sports to keeping our beaches clean and safe, bringing history to le in museums and helping people explore the great outdoors.By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week*.

Kind-hearted Mark Farrier claims he felt compelled to buy the -year-old aposold fellaapos two pints of lager after watching him sitting alone at an empty table at the pub in Cardf, Wales, on Monday. The -year-old dad-of-three says the aposold boyapos, who had even polished his shoes for the outing, was unable to be served without the app and so sat with staff walking past him for  minutes, until Mark took action and bought him pints on his own device. A moving picture shows the elderly gentleman sat alone in the bar in his smart jacket and polished shoes - finally with two lagers purchased by Mark.Mark, a thermal insulation engineer, shared the image on social media, where he was praised for his act of kindness, with others accusing pubs of aposforgettingapos about elderly people. Wetherspoons applauded Markaposs generosity but explained customers could not order at the bar due to Covid restrictions however said people can order from both staff and using the app. Mark, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear, said: I just felt a bit sorry for him. He looked like he needed a bit of company. He looked like heaposd polished his shoes and got a little bit dressed up. He said heaposd been sitting in the house on his own. I could see him trying to get the attention of the waiter and he just flew past him a few times. He was just trying to get their attention and they were just bombing past. I saw him sitting there looking into space on his own. I left it for five minutes, so I said letaposs get him a pint. We bought him two pints. I just posted to raise awareness and to help people out.  A lot of elderly people will be in this position this week. All I did was buy him a pint. He couldnapost use the app so I bought him a pint. Most people should be doing that. Now Mark has urged others to keep an eye out for the elderly over the coming weeks as those without smartphones may struggle to use technology in certain pubs and restaurants. Mark said: Iaposd just finished work and we were out after work. I stayed at the hotel around the corner from there. We always pop in and try and get dinner. I did ask them about it and they said there was only one person doing table service.  I know it was their first day opening and there was only one person doing table service, but they could have acknowledged him and said aposalright, give me five minutes and Iaposll take your orderapos. The staff were really nice and polite. When I confronted them, they apologised and said thereaposs only one person doing table service. On social media, people flocked to express their sadness at seeing the pensioner on his own without a drink, while others thanked Mark for helping the man out. Alan Daly said: Nice gesture. Well done. Daniella Blechner said: Itaposs exclusive and lacks the human connection we all crave. I really feel for this man. Rasmus Knutsson said: The elderly used to be sought out for advice, now they are treated as useless and troublesome. Even from a purely selfish standpoint mankind is pretty stupid. Because we are all heading there. Michele J. said: Thank you for sharing. It annoys and upsets me when businesses forget that not all people - especially the more mature of our country - donapost own computers smart phones  tablets .  They should not be excluded from our society just because itaposs easier for businesses to operate that way. I commend you Mark and your friends for making this gentleman feel included. Keith Foster said: We owe our past to people like him who are now marginalised and ignored. Wetherspoons have now applauded Mark for his aposlovely gestureapos and explained that customers should be able to pay with staff, as well as using the app. A spokesman for Wetherspoons, Eddie Gershon, said: At present, as a result of Covid restrictions, customers canapost order at the bar. Instead our pubs across the UK allow customers to pay and order with a member of staff as well as using the Wetherspoon app. We are not sure why this inidual customer was not served, but we can guarantee that he was not ignored by staff. It was a lovely gesture of the fellow customer to intervene and buy him a couple of pints.

Adrian Hoare, from Kent, was jailed for two years and nine months in May  after being found guilty of child cruelty by putting her son Alfie Lamb in harmaposs way when placing him into the footwell of an Audi in . The hairdresser, then , was also convicted for assaulting Emilie Williams, who was in the car when Alfie was fatally hurt, and admitted plotting to pervert the course of justice in the wake of her sonaposs death. Her boyfriend Stephen Waterson, from Croydon, was jailed for seven and a half years for manslaughter, plotting to pervert the course of justice and intimidating a witness after admitting squashing Alfie by reversing his car seat into him.  Hoare was initially freed from jail early in October  but her licence was revoked just three months later after she placed herself in a risky situation and had then lost touch with the probation service, the Parole Board said. She then remained unlawfully at large until she was taken back into custody in May . The Parole Board, which considers whether criminals who are recalled to prison can be re-released as part of its work, decided she is not yet suitable to be freed again.  However, she will be able to walk free in weeks because her sentence expires in July. A document setting out the Parole Boardaposs decision, issued on Wednesday, said: After considering the circumstances of her offending, the progress made while in custody and on licence, and the other evidence presented at the hearings and in the dossier, the  was not satisfied that Ms Hoare was suitable for release. At the time of her offending she was described as making poor decisions and acting impulsively at times, adding: She had been in relationships where she had been easily led and controlled or manipulated.  She had shown some aggression and even violence. Ms Hoare had misused illicit drugs and had mixed with like-minded, anti-social people. While the Parole Board was told of some progress she had made to address her behaviour, for example taking part in counselling, there were concerns about how open Ms Hoare might be with her supervising team. She was considered to show insufficient self-awareness or insight and to lack adequate self-control. Hoareaposs mum and Alfieaposs grandmother, Janis Templeton-Hoare, previously said she would never forgive her daughter for what happened.She told the Mirror in : My attitude is a le for a le. If you take a le, you give your le.It doesn’t matter who.

What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  A record , are now registered to work in Britain but the data suggests more are now over retirement age and may have stayed on only to help fight the Covid- pandemic. NMC polling showed that other than retirement at %, the key reasons for leaving the register was too much pressure at %. This was followed by % of respondents saying negative workplace culture was to blame. Andrea Sutclfe CBE, Chief Executive of the NMC, said: “There’s no doubt this has been a year unlike any other.  “We know from our leavers’ survey that workplace pressures and stress are among the key reasons for leaving. “As we begin to address the longer term effects of Covid- on our health and care services, it’s clear we must do all we can to support the physical and mental wellbeing of our professionals so they feel able to stay.” The NHS has , staffing vacancies with around , for nurses. Pat Cullen, general Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “This report confirms there is trouble on the horizon for people needing health and care services.  “Fewer nurses registered with the NMC this year than last. The register is growing nowhere near enough to meet patient demand. “The situation will get worse when one fth of the register retires in the next few years. “This doesn’t include those nursing staff planning to leave due to high stress, poor pay and benefits and a negative workplace culture.” It comes a day after Boris Johnson’s % pay proposal for the NHS officially became a real terms pay cut.  The Office for National Statisticssaid Consumer Price Indexinflation jumped from .% in March to .% in April. It means a % rise would be below inflation as unions warn of an increasing staff exodus without a fair pay rise. Rehana Azam, GMB National Secretary, said: “After today’s inflation figures it’s official - the Government’s pay offer to NHS workers is yet another steep real terms pay cut. “Our members in the NHS have risked their lives to fight the virus and keep us all safe. But the Conservatives think they don’t deserve a penny more for their efforts.  “After a decade of austerity, our NHS workers deserve pay justice, not yet more heartache.” The UK has one of the highest patient-per-nurse ratios compared to health systems in other EU countries. Data from Australia suggests smaller patient-per-nurse ratios are linked with lower Covid- death tolls. Suzie Bailey, director at The King’s Fund, said: “The increase in the number of nurses and midwives is obviously welcome, but the headline figure masks some worrying trends.  “The rate of growth has slowed and much-needed international recruitment has been brought to a near standstill by the pandemic. “Stress, absenteeism and turnover remains alarmingly high among nurses and midwives.” Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “The NHS is at a critical juncture and cannot afford to lose any more nurses, midwives, or nursing associates, all of whom are at the very heart of the NHS.” Boris Johnson acknowledged on Wednesday his “own huge debt” to NHS nurses after he was asked about Jenny McGee’s resignation.

He told the House of Commons: I certainly acknowledge my own huge personal debt and that’s why of all the professions in this country ... in very, very tough times, we have asked the public sector pay review board to look at an increase in pay for nurses. Care minister Helen Whately said: “I am incredibly grateful to all our remarkable NHS staff, and it’s tremendous to see the record numbers of nurses on the register. “It’s been a year like no other and thousands of nurses and midwives have worked flat out to tackle this virus. “We are committed to growing their numbers as we build back better, including delivering , more nurses by the end of this parliament. “We will continue to improve the support for nurses and midwives who have been through so much over the last year.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonNHSNursing and Midwery CouncilRoyal College of NursingHospitalsPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant woman sues boss boozy","story":"NewsPregnant woman wins compensation after complaining of too much drinking on work tripThe pregnant estate agent said she felt left out on the boozy trip to New York and after voicing her concern she claims her boss discriminated against her by denying her flexible working hoursmirrorShareByAdriana Elgueta:,  MAY NewsAlice Thomson resigned after the ordeal \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She says her boss then denied her flexible working because she spoke out about the boozy holiday. Alice Thompson said the late night dinners and drinking made her feel isolated on Manors estate agentaposs holiday to New York in the US. She eventually won a claim of indirect sex discrimination, as after the trip she was later refused flexible working hours. An employment tribunal, held in London, heard that Ms Thompson worked for Manors estate agents, based in Marylebone, London. The company had around  employees and catered to wealthy clients from overseas, particularly in the Middle East. Ms Thompson was employed as a sales manager and two years after first being recruited she was praised by her boss Paul Sellar, who told her thanks to you, the office is doing well.  Shortly after, Ms Thompson discovered she was pregnant and when she told Mr Sellar he took the whole company out to an exclusive private members club to celebrate. After she discovered she was expecting, in August , Mr Sellar arranged for the staff to go on an extravagant trip to New York City. On the trip however, Ms Thompson claimed she was isolated and became upset that the other staff members had a good time getting drunk late into the evening. She also claimed she had been excluded from a boat trip and alleged she was told that the boat companyaposs insurance did not cover pregnant women. The tribunal found however that she volunteered not to go on the activity and instead went out shopping in the city before heading back to the hotel. Employment Judge Sarah Goodman said: She may have felt excluded, but it was not because of any action on the part of the [company].  There is a more general complaint that the trip involved too many late nights and drinking, which a pregnant woman was unlikely to enjoy. However, [the woman], who had organised it, had consulted with everyone about their preferences for activities, and tried to accommodate a mix. The photographs show her smiling and confident at group meals. On the way back from the trip, Mr Sellar, who had booked himself a flight in first class, was joined by Ms Thompson who had paid for an upgrade due to her pregnancy.When he said she didnapost seem to have enjoyed the trip she became tearful and told him she felt left out. A few days later he suggested that perhaps she shouldnapost have come in the first place. The tribunal heard that after the trip relations between the pair soured afterwards and she accused him of monitoring her movements on CCTV and denying her snacks. In October, Ms Thompson went off on maternity leave, and gave birth in November . In August, she began to think about herto work and asked Mr Sellarshe could work flexible hours when she came back. She proposed extending her maternity leave by three months and askedshe could do four days a week, and finish at pm as her childaposs nursery was an hour away from the office and her husband worked until pm. She told him she would be available on her mobile phone from pm. Mr Sellar eventually sent a letter turning down her request saying additional costs and staff reorganisation made it unworkable. Shortly after this Ms Thompson resigned. Judge Sarah Goodman concluded that although the decision not to allow her flexible working hours was inappropriate, in general, Mr Sellar was a generous boss. She said: [Ms Thompson] did perceive Paul Sellar to be against her on grounds of pregnancy and maternity leave, but she was mistaken. Rather he was an employer who liked to be generous to staff and appreciated gratitude in . We can understand that Mr Sellar may have found her response [about the trip] ungrateful when the group trip had cost him £,. [The company] took steps to include [Ms Thompson] by bringing the trip forward, trying to arrange a programme in which she could participate, and in our finding it would not have been reasonable to require a programme of activity that excluded all late evening drinking when there were plenty of daytime and early evening trips and meals which included her. The tribunal ruled her claims of unfair dismissal and discrimination and harassment related to maternity and pregnancy failed. However, it ruled that she had won her claim for indirect discrimination on the basis she should have been allowed to work flexible hours. A further hearing will be held to decide how much compensation she is paid by Manors.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnPregnancyMaternity rightsTribunals"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry put place queen","story":"NewsPrince Harry put in place by Queen for rude language in Meghan wedding rowThe Queen is said to have called Prince Harry into a private meeting after he allegedly scolded her long-time dresser Angela Kelly during a row about Meghans wedding tiara, it is claimedmirrorShareCommentsByChiara FiorilloRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-says-harry-married-before-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:Kzyak,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The dorgi puppy was a gt from Prince Andrew, along with a corgi, Muick, when Philip was in hospital earlier this year. It was thought the Queen had given up on owning new pets after her beloved corgi Vulcan died last year. But she was said to be delighted when the puppies arrived at Windsor Castle.  In recent weeks, the Queen walked Fergus and Muick almost every day around the grounds of Windsor Castle to keep herself occupied as she mourned the Duke. The Queen has had a companionship with dogs ever since her childhood, according to royal author Penny Junor. She added that the Queen uses her dogs to aposput people at easeapos and said it is with the animals that aposshe herself can truly relax.aposWriting in the Daily , she said: Her bond with her dogs, though, reveals something essential about The Queen. She is an essentially shy woman, thrust into a public role at an early age that does not come naturally to her.Around her dogs she can be completely herself, sure in the knowledge that they love her for who she is, rather than what she is. That has made them her most trusted companions.  With almost every other person from her youth now gone – her parents, her sister, her husband, most of her close-knit circle of friends of similar age and background – it is one more blow that she will, in public at least, bear with the dignity and stoicism we all so admire in her. Prince Philip died on April , just weeks after he ed from a month-long stay in hospital. The father-of-four was the longest-serving consort in British history, dedicating decades of his le to royal duty, serving the nation at the monarchaposs side.

For those who were fortunate, painful commutes became a thing of the past, almost ­overnight. There was a flurry of activity in the ­property market as people, no longer bound to their workplace, moved to areas that were cheaper and nicer. But instead of having more free time on their hands, it’s led to a worrying trend of work hours increasing by up to %. The Office for National Statistics found that people working from home during lockdown were doing at least six extra hours of unpaid overtime a week.  So a new report from the World Health Organisation that reveals people who work  hours a week or more are at increased risk of stroke and heart disease is particularly worrying. The first worldwide study of its kind found that , people in  died due to diseases from working extra hours. These exhausting longer shts were responsible for about a third of all ­work-related illnesses. People in the UK were already putting in the longest working weeks in Europe, even before Covid. I’ve worked from home for several years. I felt like one of the lucky ones. Not having to commute or worrying about things like taking a one-hour lunch break meant I could pack much more work in. What I should have been doing is packing in more time away from my computer and phone. When it comes to how much extra work we do, we can point the finger of blame at technology. It’s never been easier for work to get hold of us and days are stacked with Zoom meetings that could have just been emails. Whatever happened to picking up the phone  If you’re like me, your phone doubles up as an alarm clock and so it becomes almost routine to check emails first thing in the morning as well as last thing at night. None of that is any good for our mental or physical well-being. As things start to open back up, I hope this worrying trend is reversed. If lockdown has taught us anything it’s the importance of taking our health ­seriously and spending time doing the things that really do matter. It shouldn’t be a lesson we quickly forget.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusStressHeart attackStrokeWork From Home"},{"url":null,"title":"woman who spent years trying","story":"NewsWoman who spent years trying to become mum almost dies giving birth to miracle babyHolly Campbell-Carden,  and from Wales, thanked doctors for saving her and her \"miracle\" newborn after she lost  litres of blood due to complications in her -hour labourmirrorShareCommentsByNathan Bevan:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsHolly Campbell-Carden woke up after  hours of labour to the devastating news she couldnt have kids anymore \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Recollecting how she was in and out of consciousness throughout the frightful experience, she remembers being in the theatre and asking her doctorI was going to die - he told me not to worry, that he wouldnapost let that happen.Holly had to have several transfusions and has praised the staff at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil for saving both her le and that of her long-awaited baby boy Rupert. Holly had been unable to conceive due to her polycystic oy syndrome as well as other infertility issues she said are yet to be diagnosed. The dental nurse said she and her husband had almost given up after five years of trying.. When the pandemic broke out they started looking into adoption, but they were then directed to a private IVF option which they could afford. They treatment was immediately successful as the couple ended up with four embryos, three of which were frozen while one was transferred to Hollyaposs uterus.  But the pregnancy would not be without serious complications. I had a very big bleed five weeks in, which made us think weaposd lost the baby, Holly said.Luckily that wasnapost the case although I also later suffered with high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, she added, the latter of which being when excess glucose develops during pregnancy.She also developed polyhydramnios – a condition where excess fluid builds up in the uterus, surrounding the baby. Holly continued: So last Wednesday the decision was made to induce me and, by mid-afternoon the following day, I was ready to push – although my temperature and blood pressure had risen by then and I was struggling to stay awake. What is more, no matter how much I pushed the baby would not move, which started causing his head to swell. So the doctors decided to give me an emergency C-section. From that point on Holly said she only remembers certain moments. I can vividly recall the consultant holding Rupert up and showing him to me. He was lbs oz. I also remember my husband getting very emotional, she continued.  But I was in and out of consciousness as they were stitching me back up. However the bleeding wouldnapost stop so they had to re-open me and try again. I had to have an anaesthetic but before I went under I asked the doctorI was going to die – he told me not to worry, that he wouldnapost let that happen. Holly was moved to intensive care later that evening only to end up being taken back down to theatre with more haemorrhaging. A vascular surgeon from Cardf was called to come and assist with the bleeding – that aposs the first time something like thataposs happened, I think, she said. Apparently I lost  litres of blood and needed several transfusions. I was in theatre for about  hours in total. And the worst news was to come when Holly finally woke up – the medics had been left with no choice but to give her a full hysterectomy, meaning her uterus and cervix had been removed. To be only  and told Iaposll never have another child, itaposs devastating, she said, speaking from the hospital bed where sheaposs still recovering. There is some comfort in knowing we still have three embryos frozen. That waywe ever want to try again biologically we can with the help of a surrogate. But, to be honest, the full extent of that news hasnapost completely sunk in yet. Holly was keen to praise the team at Prince Charles Hospital who worked so hard to deliver baby Rupert and save her le. My lovely consultant George Haroun and all the other doctors and nurses there that day – they deserve to be known in Wales as heroes, she said. If it wasnapost for them I would never have got to meet my little boy and my husband wouldaposve been made a widower at the same time he became a dad. I canapost thank them enough.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesHospitalsPregnancyBlood pressureGiving birthNewborn babyIVFSurrogacyFertility"},{"url":null,"title":"my best friend told cant","story":"NewsMy best friend told me I cant wear makeup to her wedding because Ill overshadow herA woman took to Reddit to ask users for advice after her friend dropped a bombshell in the run-up to her wedding that left her with no other option than to not attendmirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY NewsThe woman says her friend has often made rude comments about her appearance \" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

For context: I am a makeup artist, I wear makeup every day, and I am good at it, she explained. In my opinionI am signicantly more attractive with makeup on, and in all honestly I lack confidence without it. I also have a scar on my face that I hide with makeup, and am very insecure about. In the past, she claims her friend has made many comments about her appearance and her makeup to men sheaposs been interested in.  She says things like aposyou should see her without makeupapos when a guy expresses interest in me or talks about how aposit can be wiped awayaposa man calls me pretty beautul. Although she has apologised for the comments and opened up about how she was just jealous I got more male attention than her, the comments continued, even recently during her engagement. The woman continued: This morning, I woke up to a text from her thanking me for all my help these past months, and saying she had an important request for me. The bride-to-be asked her not to wear any makeup to her wedding. She saysI wear makeup I will aposovershadowaposher at her own wedding and it would be unfair because she wants to feel like the most beautul person in the room as the bride,” explained the poster. She told her that her request was ridiculous as everyone will be wearing makeup, and it would look oddshe was all dressed up and had a bare face. To try and keep the peace, she offered to do more natural makeup and said that she would use brighter colours to make her stand out since she is doing her makeup for her . But she turned this down. The woman added: She said I absolutely cannot wear makeup, it’s her wedding, a real friend would want her to have the perfect day, etc. She accused me of wanting to take the attention from her on her special day, etc. She absolutely refuses to compromise, despite not being able to answer why I specically can’t wear makeup but everyone  can… So, she asked users whether it would be unreasonable for her not to attend the wedding as her friend knows how self-conscious she is without it, and everyone agreed her friend was in the wrong.One person said:This person is not your friend. At all. Another person commented: She’s also unknowingly ruining all of her wedding photos that include [maid of honour] because everyone  will photograph well with makeup while looks so out of place, thus also taking attention away from the bride. This aposfriendapos has known from the beginning that she didnapost want [original poster] wearing make-up at the wedding but instead of saying so, she sat back and let her put all this work into organizing the wedding, said someone .Adding: Now at the last minute after milking OP for all sheaposs worth she demands that OP not wear make-up, the nerve of her.

And tourists flocking to the Algarve and other hot spots face  Euro finesthey refuse to comply. Eduardo Cabrita, Portugal’s minister for Internal Affairs, said: “Thisis not over yet, it is essential that tourists strictly respect the rules that Portugal make.” The news came as British holidaymakers were expected to get the green light to travel to European holiday hotspots using vaccine passports on Wednesday night. European diplomats are set to sign off plans to allow those who have had both jabs to from from the UK without having a test or having to self-isolate. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The UK could also be included on an extended Brussels ‘green list’ allowing holiday travel from non-EU countries with infection rates below  cases per , people. A spokesman for the EU presidency confirmed they had agreed “certain waivers for vaccinated persons [and] easing the criteria to lt restrictions for third countries”. But that will not be enough on its own to open up breaks to the Continent - as destinations will also need to be on the UK’s own ‘green list’. Portugal’s new Covid rules come into force on May  and will apply when the beaches are full and social distancing is dficult.  UK holiday bookings have soared for the first week of June, which is half-term for many schools, and some hotel chains are fully booked. But on the golden sands of Albufeira on Wednesday holidaymakers had plenty of room to spread their towels and bask under clear blue skies. Pals Jessica Allmark, , and Kim Steers, , originally from Liverpool but now living in London, had flown into Faro from Stansted and headed straight to the beach. The pair were thrilled to feel the sand between their toes after the long lockdown.  Beauty therapist Jessica grinned: “We are happy to wear masks anywhere - but not on the beach.” Kim said: “I was so excited. I was almost crying on the plane when we landed. I was that happy to be here.” She is a nurse caring for teenage cancer patients at University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, and had grabbed the chance of a last minute sunshine break with both hands. “I could not put into words how it has been over the past year. The hospital was full of Covid patients” she said. “You have got to get the most out of le. If you had seen some of the things I have seen, you would not believe it”  Fabian Fowler, , and Emma Kelleher, , from Bristol, had originally booked a holiday in Torquay this week. But once Portugal was placed on the government’s “green” list of approved destinations, they tore up their plans. And they were so desperate to feel the sun on their backs they drove to Birmingham for a flight on Monday, rather than wait for one from their home city the next day. “We could not wait  hours” laughed Fabian, who runs a loft conversion firm. Emma, a conveyancer, said: “The weather back home has been awful. It feels as though it has been a long lockdown.“I have been really busy in work so I definitely needed a holiday.” The couple said the bars and restaurants in the resort have insisted on customers wearing masks. Fabian said: “As soon as you enter the bar area, evenyou are outside, they ask you to put it on.” Emma added: “In the bars they are quite on it. You have to wear a maskyou stand up. It is the same as in England really. “But people don’t want to wear a mask on the beach.”  Covid warning signs next to the beach at the bottom of Albufeira’s famous ‘strip’ remind people to observe social distancing, wear masks and use hand sanitiser. Karen Miles, , and Stephen Halloways, , from Leeds, West Yorks, arrived in Portugal last October and had planned to stay for eight weeks. But a series of cancelled flights and the prospect of paying £, each to quarantine in a hotel on theirto the UK, persuaded them to stay. Karen, and former prison officer said: “We have had lockdowns here but the weather has made up for it.”  Retired postman Steve added: “There have been plenty of places to eat and drink outside so it has been fine.” He said Covid restrictions are enforced in Portugal and he fears when he s to the UK later this week people will not be taking the virus as seriously. “They do adhere to the rules here and I follow them as well, out of respect for the Portuguese” he said. Retired nurse Jean Credidio, , and ex retail worker Steve Moss, , from Liverpool, landed in Portugal last December for a short winter break and have been here ever since.  They were also put off by the prospect of an expensive stay in a quarantine hotel and are now flying home in early June. “We were supposed to go back in February but all the flights were cancelled” said Steve. Jean said they were happy to comply with the firm Covid rules during their prolonged vacation. “We would not dream of going into a shop here without wearing a mask” she said.

We have been told we will have to wear them on the beach but it is too hot to do that.” As well as compulsory mask wearing, other rules coming into force when the beaches are busy include the banning of kick-abouts with two or more people. And a traffic light system - green, amber and red - will be in place at the busiest spots, with fines for sunbathers who try to access congested areas. In neighbouring Spain health officials came under fire last month when they appeared to suggest masks should be worn on the country’s beaches. But the government later said they were not obligatorysocial distancing was maintained. Masks are compulsory for those inside or outside Spain’s bars and restaurants, except when eating or drinking.

They were fighting for a first Scottish Cup win under his stewardship after five previous failed attempts.However, it would be wee brother Tommy that would come out on top in front of over , at Hampden on May , .With the game poised at - headed into extra-time and #Well goalkeeper Ally Maxwell sporting a ruptured spleen and broken ribs after a collision with John Clark, Steve Kirk would find the goal that brought the cup back to Fir Park for the first time in  years.Maurice Malpas, who captained United that day, believes despite everything  going on, the loss would#ve stung his boss.“Knowing wee Jim and how he was with football, that wouldn’t have helped him,# the Tangerines legend said, speaking  years on.“I’m sure the upsetting week they had would’ve taken a wee bit of the edge off the disappointment but wee Jim would’ve been raging his brother won it and he didn’t, especially the number of times he’d taken Dundee United to a cup final.“In terms of the football, it was the same build-up. If Jim McLean had a job to do, he did it.“Obviously, it was an upsetting time for the family so, away from training, everything  was far more low key.“There was no glitz and glamour like previous cup finals. It was a case of leaving us to our own devices.“Guys like myself, Bow and Jim McInally, we’d been in that many cup finals there was a desperation to win.“We realised it was a dficult event for the McLean family. They’d lost their dad but my mind was on trying to win the cup.#Dave Bowman, who levelled the game at - for United after Iain Ferguson had given Motherwell the lead, concurred with Malpas.Bowman added: “Wee Jim, when it came to it with anybody, ultimately, he was a winner and wanted the best of things. That’s what he was.“Brother or not, it wouldn’t matter at all who it was. Especially with a prize like that, which he’d never won.“It was a big hurt of his and rightly so. I can see why, with all the really good teams he had and he didn’t manage to win the cup.“I was fortunate that I was still there a few years later when we managed to win it but, with wee Jim, I think about some of the players he had.“To think that Heggie , Davey Narey, Eamonn , Luggy , Holty– none of them picked up a Scottish Cup winners medal.“That’s ridiculous for the players they were.”Both Bowman and Malpas would go on to be a part of Ivan Golac#s team that defeated Rangers - to finally get their hands on the Scottish Cup in  # the season after Jim McLean moved to the boardroom.For former Terrors midfielder and current coach Bowman, the Motherwell defeat was fuel to the fire their passionate boss had lit under them for so many years.He continued: “Now they bring the cup about and everybody touches it but before you saw it on cup final day and that was it.“The cruellest thing, probably, in football is when you’ve got to go up, get your losers medal and walk by that trophy and down the stairs again.“I always remember saying to Mo : ‘Whatever happens I’m going to touch the cup’.“I might’ve been done in # for grabbing the cupwe hadn’t have won it!”Bowman#s highly-superstitious boss McLean wouldn#t have liked the idea of a premature stroke of silverware, that#s for sure.At the time, there was a belief his United team just couldn#t win a cup final at the national stadium # a phenomenon dubbed #The Hampden Hoodoo#.It was something the players never subscribed to but Bowman admits his gaffer may have been guilty of displaying some strange behaviour at times to avoid falling victim to it.“Maybe he did,# the -year-old said when askedMcLean believed in #The Hampden Hoodoo#.“Certainly, as players, it never came across our minds at all.“I never, ever went into finals or semi-finals thinking: ‘Oh god we’ve got this #Hampden Hoodoo# over us’.“I didn’t really believe that it was anything like that. Sometimes it’s just like sheer luck on the day or that wee rub of the green you maybe need.“Unfortunately, for numerous years we didn’t get it.”Elaborating on the s the late, great Tannadice boss would go to to manage his superstitions, Bowman continued: “We’d tried every hotel in Glasgow!“That’s why we were over in St Andrews , we were trying hotels anywhere.“Wee Jim was very superstitious soyou got beat somewhere you never went back!”Despite the zany behaviour, Malpas admits there was nothing the players could do to stop it without fear of retribution.“You were too scared to say anything or sit in the wrong place in case you got a roasting or got dropped,# he smiled.“That’s how he was, everybody knew he was superstitious and wanted things done a certain way.“It was to suit his superstition.#Following Bowman#s equaliser, Motherwell would race into a - lead thanks to goals from a young Phil O#Donnell and Ian Angus.John O#Neil would pull back one back quickly for the Terrors before, with virtually the last kick of the  minutes, Darren Jackson bravely crashed into walking wounded Maxwell to nod beyond the #Well keeper for -.Referee David Syme would blow for time and United headed into extra-time the more confident side.Bowman explains: “When Darren scored late on, Mo has a chance right after it, and I remember it at the time, but seeing it again it’s a great opportunity.“When it went - they must’ve been sick because they had the trophy in their hands and two or three minutes from the end of the game we equalise.“You then think: ‘We were in the ascendancy to try to win it’.”Alas, super-sub Kirk#s header would win the day as he nodded into an empty net with Alan Main in no man#s land.It is a moment Malpas hasn#t forgiven the Motherwell hero for until this day.“I think after being - down and looking as though we were well out of the game, we came back and Darren scored right at the death,# former Scotland full-back Malpas recalled.“You’d have thoughtany team had the upper hand it would’ve been us but Kirky went and scored a goal I’ll never forgive him for.“It was them that got the result they wanted and us that went home with our tails between our legs again.”Despite the disappointment was the clash the greatest Scottish Cup Final-ever Malpas, who turned out in tangerine for  years from -, sees the merits of the argument but can#t get over the dejection of losing the match.“The greatest Scottish Cup Final for me was the one that I won but you can understand people saying it’s one of the best cup finals,# he admitted.“There were a lot of neutrals there and it was a cracking game.“Seven goals in a cup final, end-to-end stuff and there was none of this tippy-tappy stuff.“There were plenty incidents in the game, plenty attempts at goal and that’s something football lacks nowadays, in my opinion.“I don’t think you’ll get a much better cup final than that.“There were , there, which was a great crowd considering none of the Old Firm were there.“It had the right tag – The Family Final.“I knew a lot of people who had nothing to do with Dundee United or Motherwell but wanted to go and see a Scottish Cup Final.“That was the game they went to and by god did they get a game to watch.”Of all the sub-plots billed before the game, an unexpected twist stole the show after United#s giant centre-half Clark went clattering into the Steelmen#s stopper Maxwell.In the days where goalkeepers were a far less protected species and teams only had two substitutes to call on, short of fielding Kirk in goals, Tommy McLean had to rely on Maxwell lasting the distance.He did exactly that # but not without putting himself through a whole world of pain a fact not lost on Bowman.“I’d rather have a crane land on the top of me than big Clarky,# he mused.“He landed right into him. I don’t think it was deliberate but he did some damage to Maxy.“It was his spleen he ruptured so fair play to him he played on there.“I think we thought at the time: ‘He’s milking that’.“You see the medical report and he maybe wasn’t!#Maxwell would sign for United in  and play alongside both Bowman and Malpas under Tommy McLean for two seasons.And Malpas was sure to remind the keeper of the incident.“We kid him on that he was never injured and it was just because he had a disaster for our last goal,# he said.“In that time, it was a case of you just get your head down and get on with it.“I think there was only two subs then and there definitely wasn’t one that was a goalkeeper.“Maxy had a couple of paracetamol and was told to get up and get on with it.“That’s what he did.”For all they have admiration for the way Maxwell carried on and helped his side to cup glory, both Bowman and Malpas believe that kind of physicality wouldn#t slide in today#s game.No matter how much they#d love to see it.“Collisions like that now and there’d be players rolling around for about a week – no chance of them getting up and playing,# Malpas joked.“That’s just how it is. Le’s changed as well.“Guys like Bow and Jim that was a massive part of their game and me, as a defender, a massive part of my game was intimidating the opposition.“Whether that’s kicking them or whatever but, nowadays that’s taken completely out of the game, whether that’s for the better of the game I don’t know.“I don’t think we get any more goals or excitement because of it.”Bowman added: “You’d have the sub goalie on and they’d be rolling about the goalmouth for  minutes like squealing nowadays.“It’s a bit dferent.”When all was said and done, the Family Final ended with Jim and Tommy McLean still brothers in arms. No doubt they were all too aware of the legacy they were building in our game.Five months on from his death, #wee Jim# is remembered as one of the greats and Tommy, long-since retired, will be forever an icon of Scottish football.All the stories surrounding that crazy  minutes  years ago aside, that#s simply all there is to it for Malpas.“Two football guys through and through,# he said of his former bosses.“What they didn’t know about football wasn’t worthwhile knowing, to be honest.“They had their silly streaks, their crazy streaks, major crazy streaks and a wicked temper but underneath all that they were footballing people.#Rangers broke Dundee United legend Jim McLean#s heart in forgotten #family final#\" title\"#Rangers broke Dundee United legend Jim McLean#s heart in forgotten

season!Dundee are just two performances away from ing to the top flight.If they can find a way past Kilmarnock, what a great thing it will be for the city.Big, big games on both sides of Sandeman Street with, hopefully, big away supports travelling up from Glasgow, Edinburgh and down from Aberdeen.That’s the prize on offer for James McPake and his players.It’s a huge one.And to win huge prizes, you have to put in huge performances.There is still a massive amount of work to be done for the Dark Blues to achieve their dream, however.Because Killie are big favourites, no doubt.They have real talent in their squad with the likes of Kyle Lafferty and Chris Burke.But they finished th for a reason.They aren’t a top, top team who were unlucky.The league table never lies and that’s what Dundee should take heart from.It will be a really, really tough one for McPake’s men but we have said all season they have the players who can hurt teams.That’s why I think a draw on Thursday at Dens would be a perfect result.A win would be amazing to take to Rugby Park.However – and I know this might sound strange – I think Dundee might do better going there on level terms.I’m not sure about the Dark Blues heading into the second leg with a lead to protect.My feeling is they would sit on it, invite pressure from Killie and it would end up going wrong.They’ve shown this season already that can happen. Conceding goals at times can affect them signicantly, though they have improved in that regard lately.However,they can go into the second leg asit’s a one-off do-or-die cup final, I think it might suit them better.With players like Charlie Adam, Jason Cummings, Osman Sow, Jordan McGhee, Lee Ashcroft and Paul McMullan they can win a one-off game against almost anybody, I would say.Maybe I am being a bit harsh on them but I can’t help but feel a draw on Thursday would be the perfect result.Their recent run has been really good but I don’t feel that can eradicate problems in a side completely.Lately they have improved and Saturday’s game against Raith Rovers will give them confidence.After winning the first leg so well and coming back with a - scoreline, I always felt a bit of a non-performance in the second leg was coming.It’s a hard game psychologically for players because you just know you have to stop them and that will always affect the way you play.Losing the goal early was the last thing they wanted but they saw the tie out quite comfortably and deserved to get through.Now comes a bigger test.The step up to Premiership teams is a big one but Dundee can definitely do it.I sincerely hope they do.It was good to see some youngsters given a chance to shine in the Dundee United first team last week.That’s a really positive thing, not just for the young players, but for the club, too.I was delighted to see Kerr Smith in the side on Sunday and in central defence, too.You don’t always see young players trusted in key positions so that bodes well for United and Smith.Then there’s Logan Chalmers and Archie Meekison featuring so prominently lately.Chalmers has obviously had injury problems to keep him out but he’s shown how big a player he could be next season.For Meekison, I’m not surprised to see him score.

Jamieson  Co., clothiers, but her choice shelter did not prove to be at all fortunate, for immediately thereafter the bear came snfing into the shop,# it continued.Disaster was averted when Bruin, the hapless bear, caught sight of himself in a mirror and stopped to admire his signicant proportions.Eventually a noose was put round his neck and he was taken to safety.The new statue depicts the bear chasing a man with a roll of material up an iceberg plinth onto its overhanging edge.Sculptor, Mr Annand, said that in all the work had taken around a year # but there had been a lot of delays due to Covid.He also had to put health and safety in place for the actual placing of the statue in Dundee.#It#s a crazy story but kind of brutal too,# Mr Annand added.#The idea of a polar bear being behind you in a shop in Dundee High Street is pretty terrying.#It was good to be asked to design the statue.#Mark Flynn, convener of Dundee City Council#s city development committee, said:#Public art is an important part of the way any city sees itself. It helps to tell interesting and signicant stories for residents and visitors alike.#The polar bear by David Annand is a great example of that.#Trip back in time: Photographic memories of the Swannie Ponds\" title\"#Trip back in time: Photographic memories of the Swannie Ponds# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp news local dundee  swannie-ponds embed # secretuyIEsxzHe\" data-secret\"uyIEsxzHe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

when coronavirus forces their gallery to close  Maja Zećo knows only too well#Maja, who became Aberdeen Art Gallery#s first-ever artist-in-residence earlier this year, had the challenge of celebrating the venue#s artworks when the gallery was closed earlier this year due to Covid- and she was unable to explore the gallery#s artworks in person.#I was supposed to have my studio in Aberdeen Art Gallery but unfortunately, the building was closed for a long time during this pandemic,# said Maja.#We decided it would be betterI worked from my space at The Anatomy Rooms studio facility managed by local organisation All in Ideas.##Each art residency is unique in offering artists time and support in developing their practice and research,# said Maja.#My residency with Aberdeen Art Gallery offers me a precious insight into ways how the art organisation works behind the scenes, which is something that not many artists get a chance to experience.#I combine activities of writing, making props, editing videos, recording sounds, working on my talks and presentations. I regularly share my progress on social media.#I aim to integrate artwork development and engagement while drawing on modernist pieces from the gallery’s collection.#Instead of showcasing her work in the city centre gallery, the sound and performance artist put on a range of attention-grabbing performances on north-east beaches and parks.Maja, who is from Bosnia and Herzegovina, was mainly inspired by two artworks on display at the Schoolhill attraction # Meditation by Barbara Hepworth and Eastre, Hymn to the Sun by JD Fergusson.She said: #Fergusson#s brass bust Eástre held my attention ever since I visited the venue for the very first time. Visually stunning, it represents a Saxon goddess of spring and it is believed to be a portrait of the artist’s partner # dancer Margaret Morris.#In my work, I reimagine the story of the goddess as a metaphor of migration, where myths of this powerful figure travelled from across Europe and the Middle East.#The golden costume is inspired by these stories while drawing from the modernist aesthetic. The artwork consists of the costume, live performances, and moving image work.#Maja also took inspiration from one of Barbara Hepworth#s most abstract works of art.She said: #The work inspired my research of the material culture of modernism and the ways I could explore it through ephemeral media of performance and sound.#Through video, I aimed to capture my search for silence in the current context of the pandemic.#Even though she is grateful she was able to create art during the ongoing coronavirus crisis, Maja hopes she will be able to exhibit and perform her work live in front of local audiences.She said: “Besides logistical challenges of filming and performing in a socially distanced way, working digitally is not always as satisfying as meeting the audience live.“I still hope that these works will be exhibited physically one day and that I would be able to perform in front of the public.”While this is the first time Aberdeen Art Gallery had an artist-in-residence, Maja, whose residency ends at the end of this month, believes the role is important in many ways.She said: #Artists can create new links between the public and the institution by attracting dferent demographics or sharing work in process.#There is also something remarkable in the museum opening its doors to an emerging contemporary artist.#There is a transfer of knowledge between curators, artists and our audience – children and adults from ious walks of le.#When asked to describe the art and cultural landscape in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Maja said that while Aberdeen had #potential and talent#, the city needed more #self-esteem to embrace a ersity of approaches#.She added: #I#ve heard many times that some themes are more suitable for Glasgow or London, but there is no reason to turn away from what a range of contemporary art practice can offer here in the north-east.#We can and we should work locally but with a global perspective. The challenges we face in , such as the pandemic and climate change teach us that.#And for that reason, Maja is thrilled the British Art Show # one of the largest touring exhibitions of contemporary art in the UK # will open in Aberdeen this summer.Organised every five years and now in its ninth edition, British Art Show  will bring innovative modern art produced in the UK to four cities, with Aberdeen being the only Scottish city on the art show#s tour.Locals will be able to see the exhibition in Aberdeen Art Gallery from July  to October  before it travels to Wolverhampton Art Gallery in January .Maja said: #I am excited about the British Art Show coming to Aberdeen.#I hope I will get the chance to meet some of the artists and experience the work in person.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Aberdeen-Areial-view-looking-nor_21908807-365x372.jpg ","title":"aberdeen youth hostel becomes citys latest covid casualty as building put on the market","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen Youth Hostel has become the city#s latest Covid casualty as its operators announced it is up for sale.Hostelling Scotland, which operates a network of nearly  youth and affiliate hostels throughout Scotland, have said its Aberdeen premises is now on the market.The  bedded hostel, situated on Queens Road, joined the network in September  and has been welcoming guests for more than  years.And in  the building underwent a major revamp, which included a redesign of the reception area, creating more open-plan living spaces and a cafe area.Eight new en-suite rooms were also built, as well as new flooring installed, double glazing, extended wi coverage as well as additional parking and landscaping to the grounds.But the impact of Covid- has meant the organisation has had to make many #extremely dficult decisions# over the course the last  months.The firm said coronavirus is the worst crisis it has faced since it was established in .An % drop in annual operational income has resulted in a massive swing from a £. million operational surplus in  to a £m operational loss in .It said the financial challenges of this period, along with the contraction of the oil industry in , had lead to this #extremely tough decision#.Margo Paterson, CEO of Hostelling Scotland, said: “It is with great regret we have to sell Aberdeen Youth Hostel.#The hostel will remain available for RentaHostel until sold and looking to the future, we are keen to attract affiliate partnerships with other organisations in Aberdeen.#This will include seeking opportunities to operate a summer hostel in the Aberdeen city area.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation.

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth.

frankly but calmly of their dferences as they held talks on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.ldquoWe seek a predictable, stable relationship with Russia, Mr Blinken told Mr Lavrov, echoing comments made by President Joe Biden, who has proposed a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin next month.ldquoWe think thatrsquos good for our people, good for Russian people and indeed good for the world.vw,vw,px, px\"Antony Blinken, left, meets Sergey Lavrov at the start of their meeting ldquoItrsquos also no secret that we have our dferences and

has demonstrated that in both word and deed, not for purposes of escalation, not to seek out conflict, but to defend our interests.The meeting took place just as the Biden administration notied Congress of new sanctions on Russia over a controversial European pipeline. The administration hit eight Russian companies and vessels with penalties for their involvement in the Nord Stream  pipeline, while sparing two German entities from similar penalties.ldquoWe have serious dferences in the assessment of the international situation, we have serious dferences in the approaches to the tasks which have to be solved for its normalisation, Lavrov said. ldquoOur position is very simple: We are ready to discuss all the issues without exception, but under perception that the discussion will be honest, with the facts on the table, and of course on the basis of mutual respect.Even before Wednesdayrsquos talks the two diplomats had laid down near diametrically opposed positions for the meeting, previewing what was likely to be a dficult and contentious exchange over myriad issues including Ukraine, the Arctic, Russiarsquos treatment of opposition figure Alexey Navalny and accusations of cyber malfeasance, including claims that Russia-based hackers were responsible for a ransomware attack on a key US pipeline.vw,vw,px, px\"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov The meeting also followed a spate of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions as US-Russian relations threaten ato Cold War lows.After the meeting, which ran for a longer-than-expected hour and  minutes, the State Department said Blinken had called for Russia to release two Americans it holds, Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. He also raised ldquodeep concerns about Russiarsquos military build-up on the Ukraine border and its actions against the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, the department said.Perhaps anticipating Mr Blinkenrsquos position and the expected sanctions announcement, Mr Lavrov had offered a prebuttal on Monday.ldquoApparently, adecision was made to promote stable, predictable relations with Russia, he told a news conference. ldquoHowever,this includes constant and predictable sanctions, thatrsquos not what we need.vw,vw,px, px\"The US is looking to move on from former president Donald Trumprsquos mixed legacy on Russia, which including a personal friendship with its president Vladimir Putin Mr Blinken said his meeting with Lavrov would be an important opportunity to test the proposition that the U.S. and Russia can work collaboratively on certain issues, like climate change, the Mideast, Iran and North Korea, despite bitter disagreements on others. The meeting comes as much of the world is focused on the Israel-Palestinian war.Mr Blinken noted that despite the vitriol, the US and Russia had agreed early in the Biden administration to a five-year extension of a key arms control pact that President Donald Trump had declined to renew before he left office.Mr Trump left a decidedly mixed legacy on Russia that included a friendly personal relationship with Mr Putin, while his administration still imposed sanctions and other punitive measures.Another, more immediate area of disagreement in Reykjavik is the Arctic, where Russia has been expanding its military presence and pursuing policies to expand its influence, to the alarm of the Americans..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: US and Russian diplomats spar firmly but politely in Iceland"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 23 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha, from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These campaigns testy not to an instinct for the #survival of the fittest# but to an inbuilt recognition that justice should be done.This should not be surprising. Our Creator is a God of justice made in his image, we reflect his character. He takes particular care to demand that minorities and vulnerable people receive, not just equality, but special respect and privilege and that justice should be upheld.Psalm : reads: #The Lord watches over the sojourners [racial minority], He upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked, he brings to ruin.# Justice is good.However, BLM and #Me Too aren#t sufficient to right society#s wrongs. Why  Because while pointing to the guilt of others, they fail to recognise we#re all guilty. We#ve all failed to love our neighbours as ourselves, we#ve all marginalised and discriminated against those not like us, even the protestor, even the victim perhaps not based on colour, but certainly on class, status or some other dference.This is where the Bible paints the full picture, justice is right, but reconciliation happens only through forgiveness. The Lord who leads in justice and who will judge all guilt, also leads in forgiveness. In the cross of Jesus, he absorbed the price of justice. He took the initiative. #While we were still sinners, Christ died for us#.The gt of God#s forgiveness is on offer. When we receive it and recognise all we#ve been forgiven, then forgiveness flows out to others and reconciliation begins."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema preparing to roll out the red carpet for reopening","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious. I have rarely met someone so filled with optimism.ldquoWith his lsquogo get lsquoemrsquo attitude, he settled into Ross High School very quickly and it was a pleasure to have him here.

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh: Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors: in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room.

Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She shouts over the clamour nonplussed - all that noise means action, le ing, businesses reopening.Not that her Borough Market restaurant, Mei Mei, has been dormant through the last year. Opening just a few months before the pandemic completely shuttered bars and restaurants, Haigh quickly pivoted to takeout, meal kits, and feeding the vulnerable and local key workers.Speaking a few days before outdoor dining resumed in England, shes buzzed. \"I cannot wait to share things on plates again Im sick to death of putting everything in takeaway packaging.\"Singapore-born Haigh, , trained as an architect before turning to food via a stint on MasterChef in . She went on to win a Michelin star while at Pidgin in Hackney. Now shes written her first cookbook, Makan, whose title means dinnertime, or lets eat. Haigh calls the book \"a love letter to my family\" and \"our Singaporean heritage\". Its packed with the Singaporean dishes she grew up eating , using seasonal ingredients found in Britain .In the book, she writes: When people move and mix together, food just gets better - and is adamant thats true, \"because food represents community. And without community, theres no food, theres no recipes, theres no knowledge of culture and dishes.\"She says peoples interpretation of Singaporean food is often confined to Singapore noodles, which is nonsense. \"One type of noodles in Singapore  It doesnt exist,\" Haigh scoffs. \"[That is] a fusion of someones idea of Singapore.\"While high streets tend to be brilliantly spiked with restaurants celebrating Indian, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese food, Singaporean restaurants often just arent in the mix. \"There are many great ones, but just not enough,\" says Haigh, and its that representation thats been missing.Partly its down to the exceptional culinary secret-keeping of Singaporean home cooks. \"Makan represents the culture of my mum,\" explains Haigh. \"She cooks a lot, like a lot of her generation, but they dont really pass on that knowledge because its just their way of showing love, that they do all the cooking.\"Haigh had to doggedly prise the knowledge out of her mum, but youll be glad she did. The recipes in the Nonya Secrets chapter, featuring her spiced chicken noodle soup, Gado Gado peanut salad, Malay hot and sour noodles, in particular are ones \"she would go probably to her grave withshe could I had to beg her to share them with me\".Telling her mum these very personal recipes were to be published in a book \"took some convincing\", but Haigh had a strategy. \"I promised a lot of cooking - and a dedication.\" It was also important to her to be able to make these dishes for her three-year-old son, Riley, so he could share them with his friends. \"Thats the way to get your mother, bribe her by using the grandson as leverage,\" she says wryly. \"I just wanted it to be normalised, so its a cuisine everyone recognises more, and that he can be proud of.\"In a climate where Asian hate is increasingly making headlines, exacerbated by Covid, and attacks on iniduals and businesses are escalating, representation is again crucial. \"Ive had that all my le, right \" says Haigh of anti-Asian racism. \"Im glad that everyones got more of a voice to stand up against it now, because its just not tolerable.\"If you normalise this style of cuisine and this food and people know more about Singaporean culture,\" she continues, \"it [becomes] normal. Its just representation it really does matter.\"Unravelling and then recreating her mothers recipes was a challenge in itself though Haigh had to translate her mums ingredient guestimation and dismantle some of the internal scaffolding of her own classical French training, \"building it back up again, as per how my mum wanted it to be\". She hadnt previously needed those recipes sequestered in her brain. \"Traditionally in my generation, not lots of Singaporeans cook,\" Haigh explains. \"In Singapore, were absolutely spoilt for choice by hawker food. Its more common to go eat somewhere because its so cheap.\"The homesickness involved in not being able to travel or access that delicious, clamorous street food world, was another motivation for Makan, \"to recreate those dishes and recreate those memories\".Ask her what shell do the second she can visit Singapore again, and Haigh is instantly imagining taking a taxi from the airport straight to her customary hawker. \"Ill probably be there with my dad, sitting at our usual table,\" she says. \"Well order all the satays, and a bucket of beer. And probably some barbecue chicken wings - everythings on the barbecue. And they have stingray as well, which is wrapped up in banana leaves and a layer of sambal tumis belacan [a spicy, limey sambal sauce with fermented shrimp paste]. And its just absolutely ine. For me, thats heaven. It hits you in the face, that chilli is so spicy. The chillies in Southeast Asia are just another level of heat.\"The moment dictates the meal: \"For Singaporeans, thats how we choose what we eat and when\". Soyou need something hearty, itd be her Hainanese chicken rice business on\" or a rendang. If under the weather, shed turn to noodle soups, and for celebrations, itd have to be Singapore chilli crab.Whatever the mood though, eating is paramount. Instead of saying Hello as a greeting, Singaporeans are likely to say, Are you hungry , or, Shall we get some food .\"Lets cut out the necessities,\" says Haigh with a laugh. \"Are we going to eat or not \" Andwhoever youre with isnt planning on eating, then \"its basically, Oh, are you gonna watch me eat \"Its that delight - in eating, cooking and trying food - that Haigh hopes to bestow. \"Im a feeder, just like my mum,\" she says. \"I wanted to write Makan so much because I wanted to share that joy.\" And you cant not feel it in every recipe.Makan: Recipes From The Heart Of Singapore by Elizabeth Haigh is published by Bloomsbury Absolute, priced pound.

In response, the Home Secretary promised \"a fairer, more compassionate Home Office\". But instead this plan creates a two-tier asylum system: preferential treatment for the small numbers who can travel here through official refugee resettlement schemes, and harsher treatment for those who travel on their own initiative and arrive in the UK via third countries.Those arriving on their own initiative will only get a right to remain for  months be regularly assessed for possible deportation receive fewer benefits than claimants who arrive by approved routes and have \"restricted\" family-unication rights. This is demonstrably neither fairer nor more compassionate.Further, despite being called a \"new plan for immigration\" the proposal fails to address some of the long-standing problems in our immigration system.It does nothing to help refugees who become homeless those who must leave supported accommodation at very short notice and have no money to pay for housing.It does nothing to address the dficulties faced by asylum seekers in supported accommodation, some of whom have been put into very poor-quality hotel rooms and offered little support, sometimes with tragic results.And it does nothing to prevent destitution among those with \"no recourse to public funds\" who canrsquot get benefits, eventhey have been legally working here. In fact, it is likely to put many more people into that predicament.Encouragingly, throughout the pandemic, public agencies were able to use public health legislation to bridge the gaps in the immigration rules and ensure that many people had safe, secure housing rather than being forced to remain homeless.However, instead of building on this experience and giving public bodies greater discretion to support those at risk of destitution, this Home Office plan would extend the \"no recourse\" rule to anyone seeking asylum in the UK on their own initiative.This is the wrong approach. Time and again it has been shown that, with the right support, people can progress their immigration claims and regularise their status. Of the families with \"no recourse\" who were supported by UK local authorities last year,  per cent were granted leave to remain. People simply need a secure place to stay and some legal help to sort out their documentation to gain leave to remain in the UK.As we build an immigration system for the st century we need the right policies, better legislation, and a dferent culture. The Home Office said in responding to the Windrush scandal, we need to \"see the face behind the case\".

The discussion is an especially hard one to have on these British isles of ours. To say Scotland has \"dferent\" values to England is either heavy with anglophobia, or weighted with inferiority.We donrsquot shy away from assigning dfering values to other nations, though. France and its muscular secularism America and its love of the gun Australia and its scorn for social class. Each example, however, is a stereotype. Not all French are secularist many Americans hate guns there are plenty of Australian snobs.Over the last week, two events on the streets of Glasgow almost demanded that we discuss whether Scotland really does have values which dfer signicantly to the rest of the UK: the protest against immigration deportations in Pollokshields, and the disgraceful scenes of Rangers fans rampaging through the city.Letrsquos deal with Rangers first. Itrsquos easier to address values we donrsquot like. What happened ndash the thuggery, violence, sectarianism, destruction ndash has been condemned across society. Itrsquos indefensible. It disgraced the country. But it happened, and itrsquos happened before. There may only be a few thousands of these people in Scotland, but whether we like it or not, theyrsquore what the world saw at the weekend. They project an image of Scotland. We cannot escape that in the eyes of others wersquore blighted by sectarianism, and the hooliganism and intimidation that always accompany it. To those watching from outside Scotland, what happened in George Square represents\"Scottish values\", just as much as the football hooliganism of the s blighted the reputation of England as a whole on the worldrsquos stage.Read more: Dark forces of sectarianism have come to exploit independence and the UnionThe horrible irony is that we here, inside our own country, know that the vast majority of us reject such behaviour ndash that only a handful of the population behave like this. Yet to an outsider, wersquore all tarnished with it. Just as all Americans are seen,wrongly, as \"gun nuts\", we here in Scotland are being labelled, wrongly, in the eyes of other countries, as a nation where bigotry prospers. Scotlandrsquos shame, indeed.We may define ourselves in opposition to events like these however,we mean that, then we must prove it. To validate that \"value\" ndash the idea that sectarianism has no home here ndash we have to stamp out the little fires of sectarian hatred still burning around this country. Jail is a good fire extinguisher for sectarian thugs. Crippling fines a good fire retardant for those in authority who fail in their duty to society.The events in Pollokshields also tell a dferent story of Scotland, in comparison to the rest of the UK. With sectarianism, we share baggage with Ulster in our broad attitudes to immigration, though, we seem quite alone. Nowhere  in Britain would have been the site of such resistance to the Home Officersquos \"hostile environment\" policy. When one thousand people on the south side of Glasgow compelled Border Force officers to back down and prompted police to release two of their neighbours set for deportation, a clear iding line was established between \"Scottish\" and \"British\" values.What happened last week in Pollokshields was not a one-off. This country has a proud pedigree of showing respect and care for refugees, as long opposition to dawn raids and Dungavel detention centre proves.And here we get to the heart of this apparently dfering value between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland is unique among most nations, itrsquos fair to say, on the issue of immigration. Brexit at its heart was an anti-immigration vote. Brexit didnrsquot appeal in Scotland. We didnrsquot vote to close our borders against outsiders. Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in Europe, was voting for peace and stability rather than expressing a pro-immigration position. A Pollokshields-style event is as unlikely in Ulster as it is in England. In UK terms, Scotland resembles those Democratic \"sanctuary cities\" during the Trump presidency.None of this is to say that there arenrsquot voters concerned about immigration in Scotland, or whorsquod like tighter restrictions. But immigration is ndash at least for the time being ndash a much less pressing political issue here than it is in England. Perhaps thatrsquos a legacy of decades-long dislike of the Tory Party, associated as it is with hardline anti-immigration policies. That antipathy may also account for Scotlandrsquos much more vocal opposition to austerity.Clearly, though, we also enjoy the luxury of opposition without responsibility. Itrsquos much easier to hate a policy when you donrsquot have to pass laws on it. Many Scots long opposed to British immigration policies, who also support the idea of an independent Scotland, have expressed worry at times thatwe ever do split with the UK, we might find our own liberal attitudes to immigration evaporating in some quarters.Immigration feels destined to become part of the constitutional debate. Only the foolish couldnrsquot envisage Project Fear II identying this social dference and exploiting the spectre of mass immigration.Read more: After the death of Mercy, Scots Government should break Westminster immigrationScotland is also at odds with Europe on immigration. France drts ever closer to the embrace of the far right and the lure of Marine Le Pen. The EUrsquos Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, positioning himself for a run at the French presidency, said he wanted to suspend immigration to France, including family reunions. Germany without Angela Merkel may become a cold place for refugees. Italy has set a hard face against those seeking sanctuary.For the time being ndash in limbo as Scotland is, a nation without the powers of a nation ndash we can see that wersquore \"dferent\", although that dference offers both blessings and curses. Sectarianism, whether we like it or not, shows a Scottish face to the world. Kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden, to refugees needing support and friendship, also shows a Scottish face to the world.Perhaps, therersquos some comfort in that strange mix.

Even those free of this tendency, however, may be tempted to mull over what there is to be said for it, since there isnrsquot much abroad abroad, as it were.There is the exciting ldquogreen list of about  countries that the UK government will let us travel to, though thatrsquos no guarantee that the countries themselves will. But the choice is limited. You can go to St Helena, the South Sandwich Islands and the Falklands, but in Europe your options are Iceland, Gibraltar or Portugal.:Boris Johnson is right: the rules donrsquot apply to him, by Andrew McKieNo doubt more places will go on the list as we get towards the summer, but there will still be some people hesitant about the wisdom of piling into a tube of recycled air and wall-to-wall strangers in order to get to some country where, on the EUrsquos record so far, most of the population wonrsquot be vaccinated.The experience of previous rises in coronavirus cases after the Easter and summer holidays last year may also lead some to think that it will be safer to stay in the UK. And the fact that countries that chose to close their borders and keep their economies open, rather than the other way round, seem to have had better results may be one reason why the UK government is slow in reopening travel.Though they will be worried about the airline industry, the authoritiesrsquo chief concern is probably encouraging tourists from other countries to come and spend their money here, rather than worrying too much about whether we can go to Torremolinos or Ayia Napa to spend our money there.Even those of us who are enthusiastic travellers sometimes forget how very recent such journeys are for most people. Many of us have got used to the idea that good weather, major landmarks and decent food are readily available within a couple of hours, often with a plane journey costing less than the anorak yoursquod need to buyyou were going to spend the summer in this country.But itrsquos only in the last  years that this has been an expectation for many people, and only really in the past  or so, since budget airlines became commonplace, that it has been readily affordable for almost everyone. One of my grandfathers, born in the centre of Glasgow, never travelled any further than the Isle of Wight, and Irsquom not sure the other one ever left the country, either.Even when I was growing up in the s, foreign travel was still relatively exotic: I was well into my teens before I went as far as England, and my sole experience of abroad was a single trip to northern France. I was  before I had been on an aeroplane, and my impression is that that wasnrsquot especially unusual in those days.Yet by the time my own children were teenagers, theyrsquod notched up visits to at least a dozen countries, partly because taking them abroad on holiday was usually a good deal cheaper than going somewhere in the UK. Vacations in Cornwall, the Scottish islands, rural Wales or the Norfolk coast now have more social cachet than going to Benidorm, and a price tag to match. While wersquore at it, the word ldquostaycation, which is so ugly it shouldnrsquot exist anyway, can only mean staying in your own house while yoursquore off work going anywhere  in the UK is a holiday, just not a foreign holiday.The fact that the UK attracts nearly  million foreign visitors a yearsuggests therersquos plenty to do here ndash therersquos hardly an international list of top destinations that you ought to visit that doesnrsquot have London in the top three, but the sheer ersity of British landscape and heritage more or less guarantees somewhere interesting to go.If you can afford it. Presumably British rental accommodation, hotels and holiday parks will be even more expensive this year,people canrsquot travel abroad, or are deterred from doing so, either on health grounds or because they may get saddled with an unexpected and expensive quarantine requirementanything changes while theyrsquore away. Itrsquos possible this will be a lasting trend, too.Therersquos growing disapproval, especially among environmentalists, of cheap plane travel ndash in fact, ordinary le having been shut down comprehensively is, it turns out, exactly what some environmentalists want, and quite a number of them have been proclaiming how much better everything is without travel, traffic, cities, restaurants or shops.:Andrew McKie: What can Starmer do to save Labour But it is also true that the growth in travel in recent decades has been happening at a time when there is less and less necessity to do it. You can always bring abroad to you. There are countless books, internet material and television programmes about almost every corner of the globe:you really wanted to, you could probably find out more about Vientiane or Mombasa or Port-au-Prince in a few hours online than you would by going to those places, without any of the cost, discomfort or time involved.The collections of almost all the worldrsquos important museums are available indigital form. The most exotic foods are available in every high street: in the s, olive oil was a specialist ingredient now your corner shop will sell you kaffir lime leaves, plantain or zarsquoatar.Therersquos just one element that canrsquot readily be provided: sun. At this time last year, the strictures of lockdown, still a relative novelty, were offset for a lot of us ndash or at least, those with access to the outdoors ndash by uncharacteristically good weather. May  was the sunniest calendar month on record, with much of the country having an average temperature of F.

A couple of hours later Irsquod be woken by a sozzled opera singer, wending his way home along Ingram Street and treating us to arias from Verdi and Puccini.Irsquod never lived anywhere like it, and even though I am now happily ensconced in the country, I miss the buzz and beauty of Glasgowrsquos majestic city centre. Yet there are some things I donrsquot pine for. Not long after I arrived, an independent grocer set up business, offering all the fruit, veg and granary loaves yoursquod ever need. Sadly, he didnrsquot last long, driven out by the proleration of micro-supermarkets. Soon it became harder to find a bag of red lentils than a magnum of champagne or a state of the art sound system.Children were as rare as ospreys. Yoursquod hear the purring of a Lexus as it idled at the lights, and at weekends the squealing of revellers tottering from club to club. But hardly ever did I see, let alone hear, a youngster. On our floor there were more French pugs than prams.The centre of Glasgow, with its high-end shops, restaurants, bars, and penthouse flats, prided itself on its glamour. Yet by the time we left, swathes of it had been turned into soulless student-land. This ever-shting community mirrored the wider picture: people living in self-contained pods, barely connecting with anyone .I never knew the names of our next door neighbours I couldnrsquot even have picked them out in an identity parade. As became increasingly apparent, you might have every extravagance money can buy within a five-minute walk, but painfully absent was a sense of community.The pandemic has highlighted a long-brewing problem. When shop and cafeacute shutters come down, students flee and the elderly retreat indoors, the centre becomes ghostly: a neighbourhood without a pulse.This unhealthy trend has not gone unnoticed. In recognition of the people-shaped hole at its heart, Glasgow City Council has devised a long-term plan to revivy the centre. Its Strategic Development Frameworksets out enlightened proposals aimed at regenerating six areas of the city, including what you might call the dead centre.For this zone, as with others, the aim is to transform it into a pedestrian-friendly and family oriented destination for day trips. At the same time the council wants to repopulate it, thereby making the area more appealing to residents who want to live there fully, rather than treat their flat as a bunkhouse. Along with initiatives to promote walking and cycling, and to reconnect the centre with surrounding districts, the hope is that by  its population will have doubled.No-one will miss the irony of trying to attract families back to an area that was once renowned for some of the highest-density housing in Europe. The demolition of overcrowded slums in the post-war era was seen as tackling disease and deprivation. Instead, the solution ndash tower blocks and housing schemes pushed to the outskirts ndash created arguably even worse problems. Meanwhile, the centre languished.It was this sort of short-sighted urban planning, which messed with peoplersquos lives, that the writer Jane Jacobs tore into. Her classic book, The Death and Le of Great American Cities ndash published in  but as fresh as todayrsquos newspaper ndash was a salvo against dehumanising architecture and development. When it came out, it was immediately understood, she said, by what she calls ldquofoot people: residents who either prefer to get around on foot, or wish they could ditch the car.Jacobs started out as a newspaper reporter, although she married an architect who, she wrote, taught her what she needed to become an architectural writer. That her views became so influential, despite her having no authority other than a clear mind and good taste, points to the obvious truth. Ordinary people instinctively know what makes a city tick: what works and what is doomed from the start.You donrsquot need a degree in urban planning to see that concrete wastelands, featureless parks or pigeon-hole flats in the sky are a recipe for misery. Or that well-designed green spaces allowing people to breathe completely change the mood and potential of a district. What Scotland needs right now is our own Jane Jacobs, to articulate the city dwellerrsquos view.The novelist John Cheever understood how hard it could be to pinpoint the problem. In The Wapshot Chronicle he describes a fictional scene: ldquoNorth of the park you come into a neighbourhood that seems blighted ndash not persecuted but only unpopular, asit suffered acne or bad breath, and it has a bad complexion ndash colorless and seamed and missing a feature here and there.Most of us who know Glasgow ndash indeed almost any city in the world ndash could point to places this perfectly fits. Now, it seems Glasgowrsquos leaders are intent on fixing the problems previous generations of developers helped create. I wish them well. But, unfortunately, there are factors to be considered which are beyond the control of any planner.Quite how to address this is for others to consider, butGlasgow city centrersquos transformation is to succeed then solutions to such wildcat problems must be factored into its vision. It sounds daunting, but it is not necessarily an impossible task.Jane Jacobs believed that, ldquoLively, erse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.Irsquom no expert, but that sounds like Glasgow to me.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

DAVID PRATT: Europe facing far right threatThen, suddenly, enter stage left another upsurge in the long brewing dispute over who controls the al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem with clashes between Israeli police and Muslim protesters, followed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas lobbing rockets deep into Israel and Mr Netanyahu lives to fight another day.ldquoNetanyahu had no cards left to play, and suddenly, he was saved by the bell, was how Aviv Bushinsky, a former aide to Netanyahu, described this latest th hour reprieve for the Israeli leader. ldquoHersquos so lucky, every time, observed Mr Bushinsky, marvelling at his former bossrsquos good fortune.In fact, such was the timely intervention of this latest escalation of hostilities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that some among the ranks of Israelrsquos more conspiratorial political observers were even inclined to suggest that the prime minister might have had a hand in stirring up the crisis to undermine opposition to him.As political rival Yair Lapid noted last Sunday as the violence escalated, ldquothe fire always breaks out precisely when itrsquos most convenient for the embattled prime minister.Clashes in East JerusalemTherersquos little doubt that regarding Jewish-Arab relations, Mr Netanyahu over the years has done pretty much everything he could to exacerbate generations-old hatreds between communities.As back up to their claims that Mr Netanyahu was manipulating the recent crisis in the interests of political self-preservation, some analysts pointed to his allowing, even nurturing, domestic provocations in Palestinian east Jerusalem, with the pushing of Jewish settlements in neighbourhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and the fencing off of the Damascus Gate during Ramadan along with the heavy-handed police action at the Al-Aqsa mosque.Sceptics, however, say master political tactician as he is, even Mr Netanyahu could not have foreseen Hamasrsquos rocket attack on Jerusalem or the intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel.ldquoWas Netanyahu controlling things from A to Z  No. It was more likely half conspiracy and half contingency, was how Amos Harel, veteran military affairs reporter of the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz summed it up.In fact, therersquos a certain irony in that a flare up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should come to Mr Netanyahursquos aid. As Jonah Shepp in the New York Magazine recently highlighted, the current violence in fact ldquographically illustrates his failures.For not only has Mr Netanyahu ldquoburied the peace process, but ldquoforeclosed the possibility of a Palestinian state, brought virulently anti-Arab Kahanists into his government, and opted to lsquomanagersquo the conflict rather than resolve it. DAVID PRATT: Palestinians cast adrtStrange as it might seem,therersquos been one thing these past years that Mr Netanyahu has managed to do during his y time in office, itrsquos the way hersquos been able to detach the Palestinian issue from the lives of most Israelis. For the past few elections now, what was once a key issue for voters has not really played a signicant part in any campaigning.Writing in Haaretz last week Louis Fishman, an associate professor at Brooklyn College, described this as Mr Netanyahursquos ldquogreatest magic trick, effectively blinding Israeli Jews to their statersquos oppression of the Palestinians.Now, however, as the country experiences an unprecedented level of communal violence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel, the faccedilade that Mr Netanyahu has created is being starkly stripped away.ldquoEven the most carefully constructed house of cards eventually starts tumbling down, and that is exactly what is happening now hellip Impregnable Netanyahuism, the work of a master illusionist, is shattering, observed Professor Fishman.So, where does the -year-old Mr Netanyahu, who has seen off numerous rivals during histhree-decade career, go from here Clearly, the most obvious thing for now is that by scuttling his political rivalsrsquo chances of forming a coalition, the ongoing crisis with the Palestinians has bought Mr Netanyahu some time to change his fortunes.The most likely forthcoming scenario is that once Israel inevitably ldquowins this latest round of fighting in Gaza and has finished ldquomowing the grass, as some Israeli security officials offensively describe such military campaigns in the coastal strip, then Israel will probably go to the polls for a fth time.Whether the current violence gives Mr Netanyahu better odds this time around than in the previous ballots is altogether another question.ldquoFrom a political vantage point, this has put him back on the horse...thinspand hersquos riding it, said Yohanan Plesner, the director of the think-tank Israel Democracy Institute, speaking to the Financial Times as Mr Netanyahu vowed to step up the military response in Gaza.As the age-old adage goes, ldquoa week is a long time in politics and never has that been truer over the past seven days than for the Israeli prime minister. For so long now Benjamin Netanyahu has come to seem like a permanent fixture in his countryrsquos politics.

They say the impact of COVID- on womenrsquos employment in particular is now pushing many women and their children into greater poverty.Speaking on behalf of members of End Child Poverty John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: ldquoSolid foundations have been laid in Scotland for future progress on child poverty, not least the introduction of the Scottish child payment and an increasing focus on action at local level.\"But this new data is a stark reminder that child poverty was still rising in every part of Scotland, even before the pandemic struck. The challenge now is for government at all levels to use every power they have to boost family incomes and reduce the costs that struggling parents face.ldquoThe new Scottish parliament must act on election promises and make tackling child poverty its top priority. The cross party commitment to at least doubling the Scottish child payment needs to be implemented as a matter of utmost urgency in order to help meet the   targets. But child poverty also needs to be a priority at local level. Local powers, including over economic development, housing and welfare, must be used to maximum effect to ensure all families have a disposable income fit for giving children a decent start in le.The End Child Poverty coalition is also calling on the UK government to recognise the scale of the problem and its impact on childrenrsquos lives.They say a credible UK government plan is needed to end child poverty across the UK, including a commitment to increase UK child benefits. Given the extent to which families are already struggling, the pound per week cut to Universal Credit planned in October should also be revoked they say, with the support also extended to those still receiving financial assistance from the old benefit system, referred to as lsquolegacy benefitsrsquo, before they are switched to Universal Credit.Mr Dickie added: ldquoThe figures speak for themselves ndash the situation for children couldnrsquot be starker. We all want to live in a society where children are supported to be the best they can be, but the reality is very dferent for too many. The UK Government can be in no doubt about the challenge it facesit is serious about lsquolevelling uprsquo parts of the country hardest hit by poverty. After the year wersquove all had, they owe it to our children to come up with a plan to tackle child poverty that includes a boost to childrenrsquos benefits. And they need to scrap plans to cut Universal Credit given parents and children are having a tough enough time as it is.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWhile child poverty levels remain lower than in England and Wales, we are not complacent and are doing all we can to tackle and reduce child poverty in Scotland.ldquoWe are providing support worth about pound, by the time a child turns six through the Best Start Grant, Best Start Foods and Scottish Child Payment.

And today Gillian Keegan, the Skills Minister, insisted people would use their ldquocommon sense to make decisions on travelling.George Morgan-Grenville, founder and chief executive of travel company Red Savannah, warned the industry was ldquofacing a disaster, saying he could not understand why it had to ldquobear the brunt of so much confused and mixed messaging from ministers.Needless to say, this was all an easy target for Sir Keir Starmer, who took Mr Johnson to task at the weekly PMQs, saying the Government messaging was ldquoconfused and contradictory.The Labour leader pointed out that since the Government loosened travel restrictions,  flights a day are going to amber-list countries and travel agents were reporting surges in holiday bookings to those countries.It seems clear, given the confusion, that, probably many thousands of people have already booked holidays in amber-listed countries and are intent on going there.Anyone who does travel to an amber-listed country must take a test and be negative for Covid before travelling, fill out a locator form, isolate for  days on theirand also pay pound for two tests during that period.

It will, however, be up to member states to decide on measures they wish to impose such as Covid tests or quarantine.However, a separate decision will be made on Friday on whether or not to add the UK to the EUrsquos ldquosafe list.There is some concern in Brussels about the spread of the Indian iant in Britain. EU leaders do not want to open up the continent to vaccinated UK nationals only a week or two later to have to reverse the decision for fear of exacerbating the spread of the virus in their own countries.Of course, there is one solution open to Britons to avoid all the amber stop-go confusion: for once, holiday at home this year."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-reshuffle-cements-return-one-oldest-allies","story":"The partyrsquos previous Westminster leader and SNP depute leader lost his Commons seat of Moray to Tory upstart Douglas Ross in the  general election.He has been on a bit of a personal odyssey since then, becoming a father for the first time and moving back to his home town, where he is now the MSP for Edinburgh Central.The -year-old has been entrusted with potentially the most momentous - oryoursquore sceptical, the most hollow - portfolio, replacing Michael Russell as Constitution Secretary.With Boris Johnson in no mood to grant Indyref and Ms Sturgeon in no hurry to hold it given the polls, Mr Robertsonrsquos role is likely to feature more rhetoric and process than action.However that doesnrsquot mean he will be idle.His Westminster experience means he could be a vital link between ministers in Edinburgh and London, and his European connections may be even more useful.Half-German with a gt for languages, expect to see him on a charm offence in Brussels, laying the ground for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU and reminding No-Remain voters that independence offers them the best way to reverse Brexit.His old friend David McAllister, a German MEP tipped as a potential European Commissioner, could be a big asset in his efforts.When Ms Sturgeon steps up her push for Indyref, andMs Johnson rebuffs her, it will be Mr Robertson who has to get a unilateral Holyrood Referendum Bill passed, and then very possibly champion it through a UK Supreme Court challenge.If there is a referendum, also remember Mr Robertson is a veteran campaigner, coordinating some of the SNPrsquos biggest election wins, including the majority of .He ticks every box Ms Sturgeon could want in a Constitution Secretary.Elsewhere, Kate Forbes has seen her finance portfolio beefed up at a time of huge economic upheaval, continuing her baptism of fire.She became Finance Secretary last year after the shock resignation of Derek Mackay, following the revelation he had bombarded a -year-old boy with messages.The story broke on the eve of the Scottish Budget, and Ms Forbes was given just hours to prepare to step into his shoes.She was widely praised for her performance under pressure.But the -year-old barely had time to catch her breath before the country was plunged into the coronavirus crisis just weeks later.An MSP since , Ms Forbes is a fluent Gaelic speaker and was recently highlighted by Ms Sturgeon as a possible successor.Humza Yousaf, Scotlands new Health Secretary, is another politician the First Minister has singled out as \"incredibly talented\".The -year-old moves from the justice brief, where he was responsible for steering though controversial hate crime legislation.MSPs passed the Hate Crime and Public OrderBill earlier this year following multiple amendments, and despite concerns over freedom of speech.Mr Yousaf has been an MSP since  and was first promoted under Alex Salmond, when he became the youngest minister ever appointed to the Scottish Government, as well as the first from an ethnic minority background.Shirley-Anne Somerville, who takes over as Education Secretary, was previously in charge of social security.But before that, the -year-old was the minister for further education, higher education and science, giving her a grounding in her new portfolio."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmThe Orcadian can confirm, this Wednesday evening, that their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to visit Orkney, next week.

In ,  stops were recorded and over , passengers came ashore.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, has moved to reassure the wider Orkney public of the stringent measures being discussed, in order to facilitate the lucrative industry.Dialogue continues between OIC and cruise companies, tourist groups and business networks, and confirmation has still not been received from the Scottish Government on when and how the resumption of cruising in and around Orkney waters will begin, and in what shape.Mr Buck said: “The tourism industry — and this includes cruise — is a vital part of Orkney’s economy, and to not allow it towould adversely affect many people and businesses. I want to encourage an industry that was very important for us beforehand to recover.“This does not mean to say that we will rush into anything, and every step will be in line with and directed by national government and industry guidance and best practice.“It has been over a year now since the last cruise ship called into Orkney, and it is very likely that this will not happen for some time yet. It is impossible for us to put a date on this at present, as we simply do not know the answer — this will be dictated by UK and Scottish Governments — it is for them to decide, and we will be guided by the ongoing advice provided by the Government and Public Health Scotland as restrictions are eased.”Mr Buck stressed that ato pre-pandemic cruise activity in Orkney is not on the cards.Nevertheless, conversations surrounding the management of cruise passengers continue to take place, discussions that are hampered somewhat by uncertainty over the guidance in which the industry will operate.Planning ahead is the sensible option, according to Mr Buck, to start these “green shoots of recovery to make sure that everyone benefits from money being spent here.”“The cruise industry is very aware of reputational damage by not getting this right that is why they are so keen to ensure all the i’s are dotted and the t’s crossed from the outset,” continued Mr Buck.“We are working hard to develop the safety protocols and risk assessments we all believe will be necessary to try and ensure cruise can restart as safely as possible and with stringent safety measures in place.“The discussions we have had with the cruise industry are focused very much on a safe and secure , both for their customers but for Orkney as well. It is in no one’s interests for it to be anything other.“The safety measures will depend on what the regulations are, and the big problem at the moment is that we simply do not have final guidance at this stage of what we are working towards.“The conversations we have had are everything from everyone on board being COVID-vaccinated and proving that, to extremely reduced numbers of passengers on board. We have also discussed passengers not coming ashore or,they do, only allowing bubble tours or a drive around the many tourist sites.”One key aspect of discussions is the increasing success of the vaccination programme, and that cruise tourism is “impeccably planned and managed”.“We will at least have a lot of information and certainty on vaccination status, and ability to plan for passenger arrivals and movements when they do arrive. In any event, we are planning for every opportunity.”He reiterated that the industry has been operating on a “rolling cancellation” programme and that all bookings, at any time, are regarded as provisional until a vessel confirms it is en-route and anchors or docks in Orkney.Mr Buck added: “We remain in the position that we are not allowed to open up for cruise liners and we will not release any spaces until the Scottish Government says we can.“Orkney is my home and I understand people’s concerns — we are all living through the pandemic. But it is vital for this industry to resume — we just need to make sure it is done as safely as we can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

CovidBritain is in a ldquostraight race to vaccinate its population in order to outrun the threat of the Indian coronavirus mutation, according to Englandrsquos deputy chief medical officer.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the jab-rate over the next few weeks would be crucial for ensuring the Prime Minister could lt all Covid restrictions on June , as set out in his road map out of lockdown.As part of efforts to ldquoturbo-boost the vaccine programme, more than one million people aged  and  will receive a text message on Thursday or Friday asking them to come forward for their Covid vaccine, NHS England confirmed.It comes amid growing confidence within the Government that the vaccines available in the UK will work against the Indian strain and that the B. mutation will prove less

vaccine delivery.ldquoThe NHS is doing everything it can to turbo-boost that, and that is the challenge thatrsquos ahead of us in the next two to three to four weeks, to make sure that we outrun the virus through really vigorous pull-through on vaccine delivery.Prof Van-Tam said scientists would have more information by next week on how transmissible the Indian iant is versus the Kent strain, which has become dominant in the UK.Experts had feared it could be up to % more transmissible, but the Government adviser suggested studies could find it is only half that.The spread of the iant of concern had cast doubt on next monthrsquos plans to ease the remaining restrictions in England, but Boris Johnson told the Commons his administration had ldquoincreasing confidence that vaccines would prove effective against it.Sources confirmed Mr Johnson told the  Committee of backbench Conservative MPs he was ldquoeven more cautiously optimistic than last week about being able to scrap all

would be taken as late as possible ndash on June , a week before the measures would take effect.ldquoUntil then, it is just too early to say, said the Cabinet minister.Mr Hancock defended the

The administration hit eight Russian companies and vessels with penalties for their involvement in the Nord Stream  pipeline, while sparing two German entities from similar penalties.ldquoWe have serious dferences in the assessment of the international situation, we have serious dferences in the approaches to the tasks which have to be solved for its normalisation, Lavrov said. ldquoOur position is very simple: We are ready to discuss all the issues without exception, but under perception that the discussion will be honest, with the facts on the table, and of course on the basis of mutual respect.Even before Wednesdayrsquos talks the two diplomats had laid down near diametrically opposed positions for the meeting, previewing what was likely to be a dficult and contentious exchange over myriad issues including Ukraine, the Arctic, Russiarsquos treatment of opposition figure Alexey Navalny and accusations of cyber malfeasance, including claims that Russia-based hackers were responsible for a ransomware attack on a key US pipeline. vw,vw,px, px\"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov The meeting also followed a spate of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions as US-Russian relations threaten ato Cold War lows.After the meeting, which ran for a longer-than-expected hour and  minutes, the State Department said Blinken had called for Russia to release two Americans it holds, Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. He also raised ldquodeep concerns about Russiarsquos military build-up on the Ukraine border and its actions against the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, the department said.Perhaps anticipating Mr Blinkenrsquos position and the expected sanctions announcement, Mr Lavrov had offered a prebuttal on Monday.ldquoApparently, adecision was made to promote stable, predictable relations with Russia, he told a news conference. ldquoHowever,this includes constant and predictable sanctions, thatrsquos not what we need. vw,vw,px, px\"The US is looking to move on from former president Donald Trumprsquos mixed legacy on Russia, which including a personal friendship with its president Vladimir Putin Mr Blinken said his meeting with Lavrov would be an important opportunity to test the proposition that the U.S. and Russia can work collaboratively on certain issues, like climate change, the Mideast, Iran and North Korea, despite bitter disagreements on others. The meeting comes as much of the world is focused on the Israel-Palestinian war.Mr Blinken noted that despite the vitriol, the US and Russia had agreed early in the Biden administration to a five-year extension of a key arms control pact that President Donald Trump had declined to renew before he left office.Mr Trump left a decidedly mixed legacy on Russia that included a friendly personal relationship with Mr Putin, while his administration still imposed sanctions and other punitive measures.Another, more immediate area of disagreement in Reykjavik is the Arctic, where Russia has been expanding its military presence and pursuing policies to expand its influence, to the alarm of the Americans.copy -.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one. The comhairle and the health board can do exactly what they like with our island in the face of our expressed concerns. Lewis, by the way, is to have a new care home.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UIG-TIDY-UP-3-scaled.jpg","title":"uig beach clean volunteers remove two years worth of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCommunity members came out in force across the course of the day with their efforts culminating in a skip-load of rubbish being cleared from Uig beach.Young and old beach buddies worked hard to remove two years’ worth of waste which had accumulated since the last event in .shortly after the beach clean, Ross Watson, the north Scotland site manager for Woodland Trust Scotland said: “It was gloriously warm and we must have had around  people take part in the clean over the course of today.“It was also a great occasion for people to catch up, so there was probably as much chatting as there was litter picking.“We filled the whole skip and had to work really hard to fit everything in. There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1621361666514.jpg--covid_19___tue_18th_may_figures.jpg?1621361666000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210518newscovid 19 tue 18th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows Two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice. Iappeal to everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book an appointment. I know there are some younger people that think they don’t need the vaccine but we have seen what this virus can do and with iants now in the mix we all need to protect ourselves and those around us. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride added: “While the risk of severe disease is lower in younger people, some may get very sick. There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post COVID syndrome or “long COVID”, which can be very debilitating for some. In making the decision to get the vaccine you are protecting not only yourself, but also those that matter to you. Every vaccine really does bring us closer, together.

It is in everybody’s interests that the media report these things.”Read MoreDerry Sinn Fein in turmoil: ‘The party’s status has plummeted... there was no choice but to investigate’O’Neill commends Anderson, but says SF removal necessaryHe questioned whether the media had been “infiltrated” or were “afraid” to investigate such issues.Mr Blaney, Fianna Fail’s spokesperson on Northern Ireland, also made reference to the brother of former Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, Liam Adams, who was a convicted pedophile.“Gerry Adams’s brother was placed in a Donegal house for three years and had charges of paedophilia made against him. No media would ever touch that story,” he said. “Everyone knew about it in Donegal but nobody would touch it. Our democracy is under attack. It is time our media spoke up and woke up and we got independence for all parties in this State.”He also called for a “much wider” investigation into the Sinn Fein’s online ‘Abu’ voter database. “Sinn Fein is spending tens of thousands of euro week in, week out on newspapers, media and independent journalists across the country and they can attack anybody on social media with the drop of an email,” he said.“Our democracy is under attack at the moment. We are talking about cyberattacks. This attack needs to be investigated and it is much wider than just the Abu website.”Sinn Fein was contacted for comment..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMcGuinness legacy ‘torn apart’ in Sinn Fein Derry reshuffleMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsMother Deirdre Morley who killed her three children told gardai eldest boy begged her to stop, court hearsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Methody College receives £.m donation from past pupilTop VideosPlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest PoliticsVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceGregory Campbell contacts PSNI chief over ‘illegality’ in community groups involving Sinn Fein membersProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsLting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider tomorrowLatestVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionCher announces biopic from producers behind Mamma Mia! filmsFury as loyalists warn of ato violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I’m actually mainstream, it’s the media who aren’t mainstream.”He continued: “The media mightn’t like the fact that someone who has a faith is in the public square but that’s up to the public to decide, not the media.”Following cancer surgery earlier this year, Mr Poots described his current state of health as “absolutely super”.“In the first four-and-a-half months of this year, I have had two grandchildren, serious surgery and now an election to lead the largest party in Northern Ireland so it hasn’t been a bad year thus far in terms of being eventful, we’ll see how eventful it is in the rest of it,” he said.On his previous objection to issues like civil partnerships, he said it was an issue the BBC were obsessed with.“I tend to think people actually obsess about their education, their health, whether they have a job to go to,” he said. “I’m focused on that for people who are in same-sex relationships and who are in erse relationships.”Ahead of his confirmation as DUP leader, Mr Poots told the PA news agency he would treat members of the LGBT community like he would anyone , as he expressed a desire to create a Northern Ireland where everyone is free to be what they wish to be. Mr Poots recalled a republican paramilitary murder bid on his late father Charlie as he expressed determination that Northern Ireland would not slip back to the dark days of the Troubles.I am a child of the Troubles — I recognise the impact the Troubles had on my le growing up. We had the hand of death wanted to be inflicted on our own home. Thankfully, it wasn#t successful.But I don#t want future generations to be going through that.

Mr Rodgers apologised for his comments and the whip was restored on  May .  Mr Aiken announced his resignation three days later.Mr Rodgers’  controversial leaflet circulated in the Ormiston area of east Belfast during the  council election campaign. It claimed  Alliance had “repeatedly demonstrated” in City Hall that it was “closely aligned to Sinn Fein”, adding: “Their record shows time and time again they vote with the IRA’s political wing.”The leaflet was not sanctioned by the party centrally and Mr Swann said it wasn’t language he would ever have used.  Naomi Long said it had placed the safety of her party’s representatives at risk .The UUP endured an awful election,  going from seven to just two seats in Belfast.  Mr Rodgers was re-elected but running-mate Peter Johnston lost his seat. Some party representatives blamed Mr Rodgers, but others said he was being made a scapegoat for the losses.Mr Rodgers said that the removal of the whip from him had been hard given that he was a letime party member. I was very disappointed to lose the whip, and I’m glad that it’s been restored,” he said.“Party members from across the city have been in contact with me to say they’re delighted that I’m now back in the fold.During those two years, I continued as East Belfast Ulster Unionist Association chairman. I never once thought of walking away from the UUP even though a number of other parties sounded me out.I told them, ‘Thanks for the offer but I’m staying with the Ulster Unionists and I’m confident that I’ll get the whip back’.”Mr Rodgers said that many people “inside and outside the party” had remarked to him that two years was “a long time” for him to have lost the whip.“Some felt that the punishment was far too harsh, but it’s over and done with. I don’t hold grudges or anything like that. I’m loyal to the organisations that I’m involved with.I’m honest, honourable and dependable – it’s the way I was brought up. And I never lost the support of the vast majority of party members.”Mr Rodgers said that Doug Beattie had his full support as he took up the reins as party leader. He said Mr Swann was “doing a tremendous job as Health Minister” and he “held nothing against him” over the disciplinary action.The veteran politician, who has served in City Hall for  years, said he hadn’t decidedhe would stand in the next council elections..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMcGuinness legacy ‘torn apart’ in Sinn Fein Derry reshuffleMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsMother Deirdre Morley who killed her three children told gardai eldest boy begged her to stop, court hearsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Methody College receives £.m donation from past pupilTop VideosPlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest PoliticsFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceGregory Campbell contacts PSNI chief over ‘illegality’ in community groups involving Sinn Fein membersProtocol pushing NI to the brink of violence, loyalists tell MPsLting lockdown: Five things the Executive will consider tomorrowMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsLatestUS and Russian diplomats spar firmly but politely in IcelandUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionCher announces biopic from producers behind Mamma Mia! filmsFury as loyalists warn of ato violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMcGuinness legacy ‘torn apart’ in Sinn Fein Derry reshuffleMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsMother Deirdre Morley who killed her three children told gardai eldest boy begged her to stop, court hearsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Michelle O’Neill meeting with Prince Charles ‘not possible’ after Ballymurphy verdictTop VideosPlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest NewsVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceDiana’s Panorama interview: A timeline of eventsLatestVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionCher announces biopic from producers behind Mamma Mia! filmsFury as loyalists warn of ato violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

between vaccinating public and spread of indian variant","story":"Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the NHS would ‘turbo-boost’ its vaccination programme as the UK races to give the public protection against Covid  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProfessor Jonathan Van-Tam said the NHS would ‘turbo-boost’ its vaccination programme as the UK races to give the public protection against Covid By Patrick Daly, PA Political CorrespondentMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBritain is in a “straight race” to vaccinate its population in order to outrun the threat of the Indian coronavirus mutation, according to England’s deputy chief medical officer.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the jab-rate over the next few weeks would be crucial for ensuring the Prime Minister could lt all Covid restrictions on June , as set out in his road map out of lockdown.As part of efforts to “turbo-boost” the vaccine programme, more than one million people aged  and  will receive a text message on Thursday or Friday asking them to come forward for their Covid vaccine, NHS England confirmed.It comes amid growing confidence within the Government that the vaccines available in the UK will work against the Indian strain and that the B. mutation will prove less transmissible than first feared.Almost , cases of the Indian iant have been identied in the UK – up from the , declared on Monday – and surge testing has been announced in a number of areas in a bid to control its spread.Prof Van-Tam told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday: “I pitch this personally as a straight race between the transmissibility of this new iant … and vaccine delivery.“The NHS is doing everything it can to turbo-boost that, and that is the challenge that’s ahead of us in the next two to three to four weeks, to make sure that we outrun the virus through really vigorous pull-through on vaccine delivery.”Prof Van-Tam said scientists would have more information by next week on how transmissible the Indian iant is versus the Kent strain, which has become dominant in the UK.Experts had feared it could be up to % more transmissible, but the Government adviser suggested studies could find it is only half that.The spread of the iant of concern had cast doubt on next month’s plans to ease the remaining restrictions in England, but Boris Johnson told the Commons his administration had “increasing confidence” that vaccines would prove effective against it.Sources confirmed Mr Johnson told the  Committee of backbench Conservative MPs he was “even more cautiously optimistic” than last week about being able to scrap all restrictions next month.Health Secretary Matt Hancock struck a more cautious tone at a press briefing earlier in the day, saying a final decision on whether to move to the next stage of the road map would be taken as late as possible – on June , a week before the measures would take effect.“Until then, it is just too early to say,” said the Cabinet minister.Mr Hancock defended the Government’s moves to open up international travel via a traffic light system after the ban on international holidays was lted on Monday, as part of the latest phase of lockdown easing.There had been confusion after his Cabinet colleagues offered dferent answers this week about the circumstances under which people could visit countries on the “amber list”, to which travel is allowed but not encouraged.The Health Secretary said the messaging had been “crystal clear” that the public “should not go to an amber or red list country on holiday” and that any visits could only be in “exceptional circumstances”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk feafe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ce-cca--bb-bfcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

home visits had been carried out in the last week to check people were quarantining.However, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary said “most of the UK population doesn’t understand” the rules on travelling to amber-listed destinations, with people “booking in their droves” to take holidays in places not on the green list this summer.International travel rules for England, Wales and Scotland are broadly similar.In Northern Ireland, journeys to the Common Travel Area – which consists of the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man – for visits to family and friends will be allowed from May .But the Stormont Executive has not made a decision about the resumption of international leisure travel from Northern Ireland..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet

It could have been titled “Ulster’s foremost radical”, because she was, but sadly Ulster’s foremost radical had become Ulster’s almost forgotten radical.Isabella Tod was one of the most notable women in Ulster in the th century and is remembered as a social reformer, a suffragist, a campaigner for women’s rights and a liberal unionist.She was born in Scotland in  of an Ulster-Scots mother and a Scottish father but spent all her adult le in Belfast and described herself as an Ulsterwoman.She contributed to newspapers such as the Northern Whig and was an active member of the Presbyterian Church, but she is remembered especially as a pioneer in such fields as women’s rights, women’s health, women’s education and votes for women.Isabella Tod was involved in the campaign to amend the laws governing the property of married women and was the only woman called to give evidence to the  Select Committee Inquiry on Married Women’s Property, to which she gave evidence at Westminster on July , .This reflected the high esteem in which she was held as a social reformer across the British Isles.It also led her to recognise the importance of securing votes for women and, in , she founded the North of Ireland Women’s Suffrage Society.The society campaigned for votes for women and achieved its first success when an  Act granting city status to Belfast created a new municipal franchise which conferred the vote on persons, rather than men.That was  years before women where in Ireland gained the vote in local government elections.Along with many other progressive women, she was concerned about the abuse of alcohol and, in , with the support of Margaret Byers, the founder of Victoria College, she formed the Belfast Women’s Temperance Association and Christian Workers Union.The plight of women who had fallen into poverty and prostitution was a subject in which she took great interest. Out of this developed the Belfast Prison Gate Mission for Women, which provided support for women emerging from the prison system, and the Victoria Homes for Destitute Girls.Isabella Tod also sought equality for women in the field of education. She was secretary of the Belfast Ladies’ Institute, which provided educational classes for women, and campaigned successfully for Queen’s College Belfastto accept female students.She was also associated with the National Union for the Improving the Education of Women of all Classes.Her interests were regional, national and international. In , she was a contributor to the Journal of International Arbitration and Peace Association.Her last public appearance in Belfast was at a meeting to highlight the problem of genocide in Armenia.A devout Presbyterian and active member of Elmwood Presbyterian Church, she was a Liberal in politics, as indeed were many Presbyterian Ulster-Scots of that time.But she believed in the Union of Great Britain and Ireland and, when the Liberal Party split over the issue of Home Rule, she became an organiser for the Liberal Women’s Unionist Association in Belfast.Isabella Tod was representative of a progressive liberal unionism that was predominantly Presbyterian and Ulster-Scots and, during the last decade of her le, she spoke on unionist s across the United Kingdom.She was a remarkable woman, formidable, forceful, fearless and utterly faithful to the causes she espoused.The last two years of her le were hampered by poor health. When she died in December , at the age of , she was buried in Balmoral Cemetery.Isabella Tod was one of the most signicant Belfast women of all time a woman of national and, arguably, international importance and yet one who has been largely neglected by the city she called home.As Ulster’s foremost female social reformer, is it not time for her to be recognised as an iconic figure whose le and work should be an inspiration to young women today At present, there are conversations under way within Belfast City Council about statues and other commemorative representations in the City Hall.Surely the name of Isabella Tod should be part of that discussion .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMcGuinness legacy ‘torn apart’ in Sinn Fein Derry reshuffleMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsMother Deirdre Morley who killed her three children told gardai eldest boy begged her to stop, court hearsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Michelle O’Neill meeting with Prince Charles ‘not possible’ after Ballymurphy verdictTop VideosPlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest NewsVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionFury as loyalists warn of ato violenceDiana’s Panorama interview: A timeline of eventsLatestVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionCher announces biopic from producers behind Mamma Mia! filmsFury as loyalists warn of ato violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The administration hit eight Russian companies and vessels with penalties for their involvement in the Nord Stream  pipeline, while sparing two German entities from similar penalties.“We have serious dferences in the assessment of the international situation, we have serious dferences in the approaches to the tasks which have to be solved for its normalisation,” Lavrov said. “Our position is very simple: We are ready to discuss all the issues without exception, but under perception that the discussion will be honest, with the facts on the table, and of course on the basis of mutual respect.”Even before Wednesday’s talks the two diplomats had laid down near diametrically opposed positions for the meeting, previewing what was likely to be a dficult and contentious exchange over myriad issues including Ukraine, the Arctic, Russia’s treatment of opposition figure Alexey Navalny and accusations of cyber malfeasance, including claims that Russia-based hackers were responsible for a ransomware attack on a key US pipeline.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov AP PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov The meeting also followed a spate of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions as US-Russian relations threaten ato Cold War lows.After the meeting, which ran for a longer-than-expected hour and  minutes, the State Department said Blinken had called for Russia to release two Americans it holds, Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. He also raised “deep concerns” about Russia’s military build-up on the Ukraine border and its actions against the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, the department said.Perhaps anticipating Mr Blinken’s position and the expected sanctions announcement, Mr Lavrov had offered a prebuttal on Monday.“Apparently, adecision was made to promote stable, predictable relations with Russia,” he told a news conference. “However,this includes constant and predictable sanctions, that’s not what we need.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news e .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news e .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news e .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news e .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cee-d-e-bef-dd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The US is looking to move on from former president Donald Trump’s mixed legacy on Russia, which including a personal friendship with its president Vladimir Putin AP PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe US is looking to move on from former president Donald Trump’s mixed legacy on Russia, which including a personal friendship with its president Vladimir Putin Mr Blinken said his meeting with Lavrov would be an important opportunity to test the proposition that the U.S. and Russia can work collaboratively on certain issues, like climate change, the Mideast, Iran and North Korea, despite bitter disagreements on others. The meeting comes as much of the world is focused on the Israel-Palestinian war.Mr Blinken noted that despite the vitriol, the US and Russia had agreed early in the Biden administration to a five-year extension of a key arms control pact that President Donald Trump had declined to renew before he left office.Mr Trump left a decidedly mixed legacy on Russia that included a friendly personal relationship with Mr Putin, while his administration still imposed sanctions and other punitive measures.Another, more immediate area of disagreement in Reykjavik is the Arctic, where Russia has been expanding its military presence and pursuing policies to expand its influence, to the alarm of the Americans..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.PAMost ReadMcGuinness legacy ‘torn apart’ in Sinn Fein Derry reshuffleMy Christian beliefs are actually mainstream, says DUP’s Edwin PootsMother Deirdre Morley who killed her three children told gardai eldest boy begged her to stop, court hearsSon of Martin McGuinness possible Sinn Fein candidate in Derry as party drops another MLA in pre-election reshuffle Methody College receives £.m donation from past pupilTop VideosPlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlayVideo: Prince Charles visits Slieve Gullion Forest ParkPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest WorldHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionSpain wants tourists towithin weeksPioneering comic Paul Mooney dies aged Israel’s Netanyahu ‘determined to continue’ Gaza operationBiden urges ‘signicant de-escalation’ in Netanyahu callLatestVeteran Jim Rodgers brought back in from the cold by UUPUK in ‘straight race’ between vaccinating public and spread of Indian iantHouse votes to create  to probe Capitol insurrectionCher announces biopic from producers behind Mamma Mia! filmsFury as loyalists warn of ato violence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After stepping down, he succeeded Damian McErlain as Derry boss.After being brought into his management team by Gallagher in Fermanagh, Ryan McMenamin succeeded him as manager.“Ive worked with Riceyand a number of them. My own brother Ronan is involved,” Gallagher said.“There are nice friendships there, but they will be set to one side. I have very fond memories and a lot of great days with the players and there is a lot of new players as well. “That goes out the window, theyll be trying to cut my throat and I will be trying to cut theirs.” Derry only picked up one point from their opening two games last season and Gallagher felt the Gods were against his side with their  league draw.“We were very disappointed with the start we got to the league last year. We have to man up to it now and we have to face Fermanagh,” Gallagher added, after Saturdays win over Longford.Gareth McKinless was replaced during the game with cramp and will be grand for this weekend. Karl McKaigue will be in contention and the Derry boss hopes to have the Slaughtneil man on the bench, while Conor McCluskeywont be far away.Gallagher was delighted with the performance of Conor Glass who kicked two points, the first of his senior inter-county career on Saturday night“I am just delighted to get him in, he is a brilliant fella, he is a massive addition and he is a physical presence that we didnt always have,” the Derry manager stated.Summarising their -point victory, Gallagher said his side wouldve have learned the potential they had to do very enjoyable things in football and classed Derry as a very good team.“We have to prove it every day and commit to each other,” he stressed. “There are very few teams like Dublin, who just win, win, win. You have got to learn how to graft and earn victories. I hope the boys see the potential that we can have.”Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more.I was bitterly disappointed we only had eight points at half-time, we shouldve been sitting with - or - at our ease and that was relying Niallkicking a couple of fties in tough conditions.I felt we left scores too easily behind and to be honest,Longford had been more clinical or when you move up the gears against opposition higher up the isions wed have suffered for it.Derry dipped into their bench on Saturday night, with Ben McCarron notching a point and Conleth McShane coming on to make his debut, a th across Gallaghers  games in charge to date.“We brought himin last year before the championship, he is a really committed lad. It is a great reward for him, as it is for the others. We want to get as much game time into players, to develop a squadwe can.” Derry senior hurlers will be back in league action on Sunday against Kildare in Hawkfield .After a narrow defeat in Round , Derry had a bye last weekend. Kildares only game so far was their - to - mauling of Donegal in Newbridge.Brian Byrne hit  points for the current Christy Ring Champions, with goals from James Burke , Johnny Byrne and Conor Dowling.Derry beat Kildare two years ago and last seasons clash ended level thanks to a late Conor Kelly point.Mayo sit top of the table on four points after back to back wins.

There was a lot of great stuff in the NDNA on areas like health, legacy and the Irish language. We really do need to make progress on them but many people across Ireland and the UK are now reimagining what the future should be like. We have been locked down and our lives on pause for almost  months. During that time, we have seen both the Irish and British government dig deep and find billions to effectively underwrite both economies. googletag.cmd.push I wrote over a year ago that the failure by the UK Government to intervene and shore up the economy would lead to a total collapse of the economy in the UK and society. In my opinion both governments had no choice but to dig deep and borrow. Now before we all get sentimental and fuzzy, they effectively borrowed money which WE will pay back to keep both countries from imploding. We are all effectively covering the loan. Its us on the hook. This huge intervention however demonstrates how governments when they need to, are willing to intervene. Im always reminded of the time Theresa May told a nurse who hadnt had a pay rise in eight years that there isn’t a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want. googletag.cmd.push Well Boris has mysteriously found a forest full of money trees. The Office for Budget Responsibilityreckons the UK has borrowed over poundbn in  . It will be poundbn in  . This is the highest ever seen outside wartime. In the words of Ted Hastings Jesus Mary and Joseph and the Wee Donkey! That will be poundbn+ in  years. Where have the Austerity Brothers George Osborne and David Cameron gone  Cameron has his own problems but Osborne is still bleating the balance the books mantra from the sidelines. I cant see that anytime soon. So, post Covid- what can we expect      Well for one thing Covid- has hit society in a way not seen since WW. I am old enough to remember the recession of the s and this is much worse than that. In the USA, President Biden has come out of the stalls clearly indicating that he wants to pump prime the economy with a major overhaul of decaying infrastructure. Its been hailed by many as a version of the post Great Depression New Deal delivered by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It really got the US back on its feet. Many across the island of Ireland are looking for a new normal. Of course, we all want to get rid of masks and go for a pint etc. but to slide back into a society driven by economic greed isnt as appealing any more. A lot has changed. The last  months has put many sectors in the spotlight. We have all clapped for health workers and carers but prior to all this, their pay and conditions didnt really interest us so much. This was the same for many of the jobs which during the Covid crisis became frontline. Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, cleaners and the people stocking the shelves of our supermarkets. Now, most of us appreciate the role they do and their pay and conditions matter more to us than ever. Without these people risking their lives and long term health society would have collapsed. Most of them didnt have the option to work remotely. They showed up and took care of the sick. They scrubbed down rooms or beds where Covid patients had been.  The point is they showed up and we now have a chance to reset our society and replace the clapping with a better salary. For me,it means a bit extra in tax, Im happy to pay it. Now when I see - Deliveroo drivers waiting outside a Take-away for a job I cant help but feel sorry for their plight. Before I was oblivious to it but now, I see just how unfair society has got. Some person designs an algorithm and sits in Calornia and earns billions while a delivery drivergets minimum wage. Many are now calling for a social revolution across society. Ive heard build back better and build back stronger bandied about like snuff at a wake but it makes perfect sense. In Derry, we have saw throughout this crisis a number of community organisations across the city step up and work in partnership with DCSDC and central government. Their roots are in the community and without their involvement during Covid- many more people would have died or slipped deeper into poverty. We really need to build on that. For me, there needs to be a major rethink at central and local government level on how we deliver the recovery. A cornerstone for this needs to be a recognition of the important role the community and voluntary sector play. We must mobilize these communities and connect with them and most importantly invest in them. If local or central government want to do community planning then invest real money in it and forget these detailed desk based action plans which often have no resources behind them but look great on a PowerPoint. And when you think about it who is best placed to help young people within some of our most disadvantaged get jobs. We have had an economic policy for the last  years which mixes encouraging and supporting indigenous businesses whilst attracting Foreign Direct Investment . Its had some success but it hasnt taken Derry off the top of the unemployment league for the North. There are quite a few other communities it has failed. Its now time to recognise that empowering organisations within these communities and backing them financially is the way to see jobs and a better society. And how do we do it  Within the North I would empower the Department of Communities and give it the budget to deliver it. They could jointly deliver this with Invest NI through the Department for Economy. That would be the best model for delivery. I would also put social enterprise and its promotion on a par across the island. There is no reason why more of our young people keen to start a business wouldnt decide on this structure. All the social enterprises I know make profits. Its what they do with these profits which is dferent. They reinvest in the staff and community instead of paying idends. Many others use profits to provide vital services in their communities. Many young people are already starting social enterprises and others are seeing a career working in a social enterprise in a dferent light. The biggest problem is that most people think social enterprises are confined to a sector. Theyre not. It’s more a way of doing a business rather than a specic sector. We have one chance to get this right as hopefully Covid is a once in a letime event. Already initiatives like Buy Social from the Department of Finance are recognising social capital in all their tenders. We need to do more, however. Lets not go back to the old normal because lets face it, things were not so great. President Harry Truman attempted a New Deal in the USA after WW. His  point plan which included developing a US version of the NHS and many other things failed. He also wanted to increase minimum wage and tackle some of the civil rights issues still visible in the US.It failed and most of the  objectives where never met. Lets hope we can learn from Covid and unlike President Harry Truman deliver a fair deal to everyone in society. Trickledown economics is a myth folks and its time we value people and work with our communities here to build a fairer society.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since opening in , the city centre hotel has received a string of accolades. It has now been ranked in the top ten on the ‘Best of the Best’  TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Award list for the fth year in a row. Other hotels on the prestigious list Claridge’s of London. The accolade is another boost for the owners and staff at Bishops Gate Hotel as it prepares to reopen next Monday, May , in the latest phase of the relaxing of the Covid restrictions. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran ONeill, Managing Director of Bishop’s Gate Hotel, said they were honoured to make it on to the Tripadvisor Top  list. “When you look at the locations and names of the hotels featured on this list, it is a great statement of confidence in the citys hotel offering and an endorsement of the commitment and effort by everyone involved,” he said. “This award shines a spotlight on the North West’s premium hospitality industry and will provide a real boost to the international image of the region and a boost to domestic tourism. Derry-Londonderry isa confident, vibrant, forward looking city and district that provides the best of all worlds, offering city, coastal and countryside experiences. googletag.cmd.push “This award is a reflection of our staff’s enthusiasm, dedication, and commitment to excellent customer service. “In my opinion, they are simply the best and that’s why Bishop’s Gate has been recognised by the TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards five years in a row.” Mr ONeill said the hotel industry is going through one of the longest periods of lockdown. “Despite being only open for limited periods last year, we continued to trade when permitted to do so. “Undoubtedly, there will be challenges ahead but, what there is no doubt about, is the tenacity and commitment of Bishop’s Gate Hotel and its team as we move into this next phase.     “Everyone is aware of the responsibilities that rest on our collective shoulders to adhere to best practice. “This year, we are confident that staycations will be a popular choice for many wishing to holiday at home. “At Bishop’s Gate, we work tirelessly to deliver experiences that exceed expectations whilst positioning ourselves as one of Northern Ireland’s leading destinations. “This award shows we are at the top of our industry and we look forward to continuing to deliver the highest quality standards our guests expect.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This would appear to show that the massive vaccination programme is having an impact on protecting the older members of the community.

We must have a Plan B, should upcoming relaxations push rate up further, she said. Fortunately data indicates vaccines are working as infections are mainly - and - yr olds, with few Covid patients in Altnagelvin. But Long Covid is still a real risk and with hospitality opening more fully, we must be mindful that many young people work in these roles. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bastion Community Garden in the Fountain was this evening named at the Community Garden of the Year for the UK. The competition was run by the world-famous Cha Garden Show in conjunction with the BBCs The One Show. The winner was announced on the show a short time ago. The inspiration behind the local garden project is Fountain community worker Jeanette Warke. Her vision several years ago to turn an empty piece of land in the area into a community allotment was soon turned into a reality.  The garden is now at the heart of the community and is used by a large amount of people to grow their own food. googletag.cmd.push A crew from The One Show was in Derry recently to film the story behind the Fountain garden. Jeanette thought they were filming because the garden had been shortlisted for the award. However, she was stunned when she was told that they had actually won. Among those who have congratulated Jeanette and her team are her musical hero Daniel ODonnell and gardening guru Monty Don. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Desertmartin, Glen and Derry player Emma Kelly took over as the Saffrons manager on the eve of the new season. She played camogie for Ballinascreen and football with Desertmartin alongside current Derry players Nuala Brown and Tomaisina Cassidy. When the Martins folded for a season, she played for Glen with current Derry players Caoimhe Kirkpatrickand Danielle Kivlehan. In the Derry colours, she soldiered with Ciara Moore who is still part of Odhran McNeillys Oakleaf plans. When it looked like Derry werent going to have a team, she moved to play for the Saffrons and was later part of their  All-Ireland junior winning team. googletag.cmd.push After not being part of manager Dee McConvilles plans for this season, she had resigned herself to the fact her county career was over, while still playing for St Pauls, to whom she transferred when moving to Belfast for work. When McConville stepped down as manager on the cusp of the league, Kellys phone was hopping with players urging her to take the job, followed by a call from the Antrim Chairperson asking her to take on the role in an interim basis. “So it is sort of forced retirement...I am hardly going to put myself on,” Kelly jokes. “I turned  last month, so it was about time somebody stepped into the roleanyway. googletag.cmd.push “I coached most of the senior squad going up through underage,” Kelly said of her time in charge of ious Antrim Development squads. Kelly enlisted the help of Down All-Ireland winning forward Kyla Trainor as Head Coach and the duo got to work with a trial process to get a squad of players drawn up for the new season. Now confirmed as manager, Emma looks ahead to a five year plan of development. “We opened up the trials to every club, regardless of ision. If girls want to trial for a county team, then they should be given the opportunity and it was the same in Derry when I was playing,” Kelly points out.     She listed Antrim and Derry under the same umbrella, sleeping giants of the ladies game. There is youthful tinge to the Saffrons squad. There are five current minors on board, with a group of talented players still in their first year of minor left to their own grade and to focus on their studies for now. “With me out, Cathy Carey is the oldest...she ticks that box now,” laughs Emma. “The next oldest would be  or , so we have a range all the way down to  or , so it is a good mix.” Going down the years, there wouldve been a core of players putting their shoulder to the wheel of Antrim football. Others, came and went, with some coming in at the last minute on the basis of a reputation earned where. The new management duo have a dferent outlook, based on their experiences on squads down the years. “We know what we hated when we were playing, you dont like people walking into ,” Kelly states. “We have stamped that out. If youre not committing,you havent havent been at training and havent told us...youre gone. It is as simple of that.” The starting team and squad will be picked based on Antrim performances. The seven of her St Pauls clubmates have been told they will be judged on their commitment and application to the county. “I dont care who you think you are or what you think you are, were out to win and put the best team out,” Kelly adds. “You will be taken off and put on as we see fit and I think they are buying into it. There is a buzz, that things are going to be done right and people arent going to walk out. “We are putting changes in place that we have girls there who want to play for the county. We have  girls who will commit to being there, they mightnt be the best  in the county talent wise, butyou are the best in the county that are going to commit and work together at bringing the county on, thats the way we are going.” Emma, who works in Sports Development, looks on the Antrim job as a five-year project. Getting out of Division  figures in her thoughts. “We obviously want to compete this year, we came in late but there is a good buzz and a lot of talent there, so we will hopefully compete well. It is a building process and there is a lot of talented young girls coming though. “Theyll be playing along with the likes ofMcFarland, Tosh , Cathyand Aine Tubridy, who will all bring them along in the setup.” Derry and Antrim will meet in the Ulster final later in the season and Sunday will be a marker on how the season will fare out. With a mixture of both counties, in opposite corners, it will be an interesting Sunday ahead. LISTEN: Interview with Derrys Anna Frizelle.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing. As a teacher myself I think its great to have such books for children showing ersity.Cara inspired a new fashion range earlier this year for girls and teens born with the same condition as her.She hopes to be a spokesperson and campaigner for people with dwarfism in the future.The Irish Roots Festival, created by Tipperary native Lorraine Maher, finishes today.Speaking about the festival, she said: ldquoMixed-race people are one of the fastest growing demographics in the western world, it is crucial to highlight the lives, achievements and struggles of mixed-race Irish people.ldquoThis is a great opportunity to give a shout out globally to those of Irish ancestry regardless of colour or location, she said. ldquoRepresentation is so important for a sense of well-being and belonging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Developers.jpg","title":"Developers invited to enter bids for redevelopment site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will be asked within the next few weeks to submit their respective bids for the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police base in Downpatrick.The news was confirmed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee on Monday evening.Stretching back as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, the proposed development site includes the Irish Street car park and a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base.It is understood that five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand the local authorityThe development brief paves the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site and developers will be given up to  weeks to submit their respective proposals with a final assessment then made to select the preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, the company will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Councillors were due to discuss a motion at Monday nightrsquos meeting which urged the council to acquire land to create a road access through the development site on to St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of the redevelopment proposal and also upgrade and integrate three adjoining privately owned car parks into the proposal.Debate on the motion was adjourned, but in papers submitted prior to the committee meeting senior council staff made it clear that any change would result in the suspension of the development brief and changes to the projectrsquos business case.The local authority has been working on the Irish Street project in partnership with the DfC for some time and when the police base became available for sale, the local authority commissioned a feasibility study exploring options around how the site could be developed in tandem with the Irish Street car park.The study concluded that a so-called mixed use development of the sprawling site would be the most suitable option with the government department subsequently acquiring the land, with the local authority purchasing a strip of land between the Irish Street car park and the former police base.A project board was then set up comprising Downpatrick area councillors and a number of local stakeholders including business community representatives which sought the views of developers and the local community around the sitersquos potential uses and constraints.It was confirmed on Monday night that based on the feedback the development brief was worked up and will go to market in the coming weeks. Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward.

Photograph by Declan Roughan   Press EyeDoesn’t it all seem a somewhat distant memory  Domestically, Belfast City Councillor Michael Long — of the Alliance Party — probably spoke for many last month when he posted a tweet mocking that speech Jamie Bryson delivered well after the riots and the media attention had faded away, atop a blue wheelie bin outside a PSNI station in Newtownards. The many who would join Councillor Long in his mockery almost certainly account for a majority of the population in Northern Ireland these days: an uneasy coalition of nationalists, republicans, greens and Alliance voters perhaps, but one very much at ease in indulging shared pleasures, amongst which sneering at loyalists clearly seems to figure fairly highly.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It was reported that Jamie Bryson has struck up a friendship with GAA pundit Joe Brolly. Brolly recently wrote that in the event of a vote for a united Ireland, consideration should be given to the creation of a separate independent Northern stateA beleaguered minority they may be, but nonetheless it is loyalists who are doing the heavy lting in articulating the anger of the entire unionist community at Boris’s imposition of a border down the Irish Sea. Mainstream unionism’s words turn into ashes in the mouths of those who have voted for and justied this extraordinary constitutional vandalism. Loyalism thus has a credibility which mainstream unionism no longer possesses. To adapt a famous slogan of James Connolly: “Only the loyalist working class remain as the incorruptible inheritors of the fight for the Union in Northern Ireland”. The question for loyalists in this rather paradoxical situation of being simultaneously more isolated than ever before in Northern Ireland, but also standing at the vanguard of a demoralised wider unionist community, must be, as Sunday Independent commentator Eilis O’Hanlon recently put it:  Quo Vadis  ie. Where are you going To attempt some kind of answer, it might be helpful to look at a place where loyalists are no longer welcome or cherished: Dublin. David Campbell of the Loyalist Communities Council recently and poignantly lamented the days when Bertie Ahern “remained focused on dialogue with unionists and loyalists ... even as his own mother was dying ... reassuring us that he wanted a new relationship with Northern Ireland based on cooperation and mutual respect”. Despite a similar generosity of spirit evident in Micheál Martin’s ‘Shared Island’ initiative, it is the new Fine Gael of Varadkar and Coveney, flanked by their frenemies in Sinn Féin, utterly in thrall to the EU, and oozing an aggressively amnesiac middle class Irish disdain for all things British, which is very much in the ascendant in the South. Varadkar speaks of the ‘conversation’ about a united Ireland in the same breathless way that the Queen’s University academic Colin Harvey does, with what seems to me like no awareness whatsoever that unionists have never asked to be part of that conversation. This drumbeat of Irish unity emanating from Dublin would of course count for very little were it not for the fact that British government policy towards Northern Ireland is now fully in accord with the sentiments expressed by Dominic Cummings when he reputedly said that he would not care“Northern Ireland falls into the f***ing sea”, whilst the recent trial of two British Army veterans in Belfast for the  killing of Official IRA commander Joe McCann has a distinct whf of a departing power making amends with what it sees as the natives. The disturbing reality is that we are in a situation worse than the mid s when Great Britain seemingly spent a signicant amount of time announcing in advance its intentions to disengage from Northern Ireland. The imposition of the sea border means that Britain has now disengaged. Tony Blair’s former Chief of Staff, Jonathan Powell, who helped found the Loyalist Communities Council, was on Channel  News at the height of the riots a few weeks ago when it briefly looked like there might be major incursions across the Springfield Road Lanark Way peaceline. Unlike Councillor Long he did not come to sneer at loyalists. In language remarkably similar to that the British government once used to coax Sinn Féin into dialogue, he said that loyalists “have legitimate reasons to feel aggrieved” and that “we should offer a political way forward for those loyalists who want to take it”. Yet aggrieved working class loyalists cannot inflict defeat upon their political enemies at Westminster in the same way that aggrieved Red Wall voters in the North of England were able to do in the last UK general election: long before the Irish Sea border, British party politics has been almost entirely managed outwith Northern Ireland.In the Belfastthe other week it was reported that Jamie Bryson has struck up a friendship with GAA pundit Joe Brolly, with “pints and footie matches” planned. Brolly recently wrote a long article for the Sunday Independent about the prospects of constitutional change on this island, precisely due to what he too saw as the reality of British disengagement. Ironically this article was heavily criticised by unionists such as Ian Acheson and also in a letter sent to the paper by self declared “liberal Ulster Protestant” Dermott Simpson. Yet Brolly said something which may provide an answer to where loyalists can go now. He said that, in the event of a border referendum resulting in a majority vote for a united Ireland, consideration should be given to the creation of a separate independent Northern state, operating in the same spirit of co-operation and mutual respect with the Southern state that David Campbell recalled Bertie Ahern wanting between Northern Ireland and the Republic. State, even nation, building would be a far from ignoble political path for loyalists to follow given the paucity of other dignied options open to them.• Link to article by Joe Brolly here——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The meeting comes as much of the world is focused on the Israel-Palestinian war.Mr Blinken noted that despite the vitriol, the US and Russia had agreed early in the Biden administration to a five-year extension of a key arms control pact that President Donald Trump had declined to renew before he left office.Mr Trump left a decidedly mixed legacy on Russia that included a friendly personal relationship with Mr Putin, while his administration still imposed sanctions and other punitive measures.Another, more immediate area of disagreement in Reykjavik is the Arctic, where Russia has been expanding its military presence and pursuing policies to expand its influence, to the alarm of the Americans..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: US and Russian diplomats spar firmly but politely in Iceland article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Health Minister Robin Swannsaid: “This announcement today will be welcome news for those within the age range and is a further testament to the successful delivery of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. Vaccination is vital in helping us move through this pandemic and there is no doubt that there are people in Northern Ireland alive today because they have been vaccinated. “Next week we will see further easing of restrictions with the re-opening of licensed and unlicensed premises indoors, the remainder of tourist accommodation and the further relaxation to the rules over visiting indoors. This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice. Iappeal to everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to book an appointment. I know there are some younger people that think they don’t need the vaccine but we have seen what this virus can do and with iants now in the mix we all need to protect ourselves and those around us. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride added: “While the risk of severe disease is lower in younger people, some may get very sick. There is much we still have to learn about this virus and post COVID syndrome or “long COVID”, which can be very debilitating for some. In making the decision to get the vaccine you are protecting not only yourself, but also those that matter to you. Every vaccine really does bring us closer, together. People making bookings are asked to be patient, as demand for appointments is expected to be strong. The ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme will continue to be dependent on the availability of vaccine supplies.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcfdcdbedcae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aacfacafbdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
