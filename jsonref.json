Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

A total of £100,000 has already been raised and the sale of the four art masks aims to raise a further £20,000.Shrigley has produced a mask that seems to be a blur of black lines, but look carefully and there is the word “emotions” hiding among them. He said it was a nod to how difficult it is to see human emotions when people wear a mask.The artist is best known for his mordant, often deceptively simple cartoons that are providing much-needed cheer via his Twitter account. Bigger works include the gigantic bronze thumb’s-up installed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2016.Shrigley said: “The fund will provide incredible support to emerging artists at a time when the art world entirely ground to a halt, but also the technicians, the assistants, the small galleries that do so much to support younger artists in turn.”The other masks are by Yinka Shonibare, Eddie Peake and Linder Sterling, who has revisited the album cover she co-created for the Buzzcocks’ Orgasm Addict in 1977.The masks are available through a three-week crowdfunding campaign and are priced at £35 each, or £120 for all four. They can be worn or collected for posterity.The Contemporary Art Society has been championing the collection of contemporary art and craft in the UK since 1910. Its director, Caroline Douglas, said the charity was one of the most important grassroots-level investors in the arts ecosystem.“That support is of critical importance right now, injecting investment directly where it is needed whilst helping museums become more active centres of our communities as we slowly recover from this period of lockdown.”Alistair Hudson, the director of the Whitworth and Manchester art galleries, said the rapid response fund was a wonderful thing.“Throughout this time of isolation and uncertainty, one thing that has been starkly revealed is the vital role that art plays in our lives, providing a creative stimulus and a way to assert our humanity when we need it most. In this light, museums and galleries will be needed even more than they were before when we re-enter the world to rebuild a way of life.“The CAS are a lifeline in the best of times, and now also in a moment of crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f235a5977edb03daf99adef77b946ce04d7477f0/0_82_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee78383b8a35dcc217811909381cff53","title":"italian woman wins 1m picasso in christmas raffle","story":"€100 ticket scoops ‘incredible’ 1921 still life oil painting by Spanish master An Italian accountant whose son bought her a raffle ticket as a Christmas present won a Pablo Picasso oil painting valued at €1m ($1.1m) in a charity draw on Wednesday.Claudia Borgogno summed up her amazement in one word: incredible. “I have never won anything before,” said the 58-year-old told from Ventimiglia, in north-western Italy.Borgogno said she liked Picasso and the prospect of being able to hang one of his paintings on her wall was still sinking in.Her son, Lorenzo Naso, bought two tickets, worth €100 each, in December, sending one to his mother. “It was maybe the best decision in my life,” he said.The ticket was picked out in an electronic draw at the auction house Christies in Paris.Organisers valued the painting, Nature Morte, or Still Life, as being worth $1.1m. The billionaire art collector who provided it, David Nahmad, said the work wasworth at least two or three times that.The 51,140 tickets sold online for €100 ($109) each. Proceeds are going to provide water for villagers in Madagascar and Cameroon.The draw was originally scheduled for March but delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Naso said he had not realised it was taking place on Wednesday and was not watching the live broadcast.The call from organisers to say that his mother had won came as shock. “When I arrived and I told her she has won she was like: ‘Please don’t joke’,” he said.Naso, an analyst for the European Union’s securities markets regulator, lives in Paris but has been staying with his mother in Italy during the coronavirus lockdown. “It was a pretty awful period for us during this lockdown and now its great news,” he said.Nahmad will be paid €900,000 for the work. The painting was the smallest of 300 works by Picasso that he owns, the largest private collection of works by the Spanish artist.The small still life, which is signed Picasso, shows a newspaper and a glass of absinthe on a wood table. Picasso painted it in 1921.Tickets were bought in more than 100 countries, with the bulk sold in France, the United States, Switzerland and Italy.

He and his ‘Yoda’ Alex de Campi explain their very timely projectWhen film-maker Duncan Jones decided to tell the third story in his tangentially linked science fiction trilogy, following Moon (2009) and the 2018 Netflix series Mute, he ran into a problem: the tale he wanted to tell was so vast that it would need a crippling budget to get it filmed.So Jones – the British-born, LA-based son of David Bowie and his first wife Angie – decided to tell the final part of his so-called Mooniverse trilogy, Madi, in a whole new medium: comics.“When the reality of Madi’s scale hit the budgeting process, it was clear that getting a film like that made … was going to be an uphill battle,” says Jones. “But film is just one way to tell a story. Comics are another.”Jones – perhaps a little disingenuously but charmingly so – says he’s not a big comics fan, while in the next breath describing a childhood spent reading The Trigan Empire, Marvel and DC comics, and his dad giving him graphic novels such as Black Hole by Charles Burns, Maus and When the Wind Blows (for whose animated version Bowie provided the title track). How is he not a comics fan? “I say that to be respectful of those people out there who truly are,” he says.Madi, subtitled Once Upon a Time in the Future, is set in the “Mooniverse”, the same near-future reality as Moon and Mute, but none of the stories are directly linked. Jones refers to the three stories as his “salty Cornetto trilogy”, a reference to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg’s “Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy” made up of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World’s End.Madi follows the title character, who is one of many enhanced ex-military personnel who have become indentured to the giant private corporations that run the world, working as mercenaries in order to pay for the technology that was put into their bodies during their years of service. Madi finally has enough and, after a bad final job, goes on the run.A year ago, Jones asked his 350,000 Twitter followers to recommend the best comics artists to bring his vision to life. Having assembled a roster of possible candidates, Jones needed someone who could help him adapt his movie into a comic. That led him to “my Sherpa, my Yoda, my guru”, the comic writer and novelist Alex de Campi.It was De Campi’s idea to have more than one artist illustrate what turned out to be a 260-page graphic novel, splitting it between the talent that Jones had been wowed by on Twitter. “I’ve got a lot of work and made a lot of great connections via social media but this is by far the best,” she says. “It wasn’t so much a vote thing or an internet popularity contest, but I think a few big industry friends weighed in privately to Duncan to say ‘she’s all right’ when I responded to his callout.”It took De Campi two months to adapt the script, sending it to Jones in 10-page batches. “Duncan over in LA would review the pages and tweak things and we pretty much had a constant back and forth about the script as we went,” De Campi says. “The adaptation happened very fast, because the faster I had a script ready, the more time artists had to draw.”The artists behind Madi are a who’s who of comic talent, comprising Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Ocaña, André Araújo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O’Connell, Tonči Zonjić, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Guéra, Chris Weston, Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David López and Christian Ward, with covers by Duncan Fegredo and Yuko Shimizu.On Tuesday, Jones and De Campi launched a Kickstarter to raise £40,000 to fund the project within hours, it reached £125,000. Madi will be released in a variety of hard-copy formats – not digitally – in November, with the first 19 pages already available online.Are either of them afraid that film or Netflix fans won’t follow them to a comic book? “Because of the pandemic, this is the Year Without Movies – and you’re asking me if we’re sorry we’re doing this as a graphic novel?” says De Campi. “Look, making stuff is hard. Get your work out any way you can. And who says this won’t also be a movie one day, when it’s safe to shoot again?”Jones, who is also working on a film adaptation of the 2000AD comic Rogue Trooper, is convinced that Moon and Mute fans will enjoy Madi, even if they don’t normally read comics.“Storytelling is storytelling,” he says. “From drive-in movies to stories around the campfire. If someone can engage you, they’ll paint the picture in your mind ... and the painters I’m working with are pretty exceptional.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/630b185744db8f8b0d91b575f5ae43f5f39c22b0/0_124_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c98a72c223d553dcf3530b7444bf4a6","title":"uk furniture stores to reopen in time for bank holiday weekend","story":"Furniture Village to open all outlets on Saturday while DFS will open some sites on FridayDFS and Furniture Village are to reopen outlets in time for the bank holiday weekend after the government cleared furniture stores to restart trade.Furniture Village will reopen all 46 branches on Saturday after testing physical distancing measures in six stores including Bristol, Gillingham, Tamworth and York over the past week. DFS is set to open a handful of outlets on Friday. Fellow sofa specialist ScS said it was aiming to reopen “as soon as practically possible”. Ikea is also believed to be planning to trial a small number of stores as early as this weekend.The openings come after homewares chain Dunelm tested the water with the opening of seven stores in the Midlands on 12 May after it said the government had given it the go-ahead. The retailer has gradually reopened 39 of its 171 stores and enabled online shoppers to collect orders from the majority of stores since 12 May.The furniture retailers have taken action after the government subtly clarified its definition of “essential” retailers on 13 May to say homeware stores were included, rather than its earlier definition of “home and hardware” stores. Industry insiders said retailers had also held back on reopening because of concerns about how to safely operate deliveries of large items, such as sofas, which require two people.Charlie Harrison, the commercial director of Furniture Village, said: “We are delighted to be officially reopening all Furniture Village stores this week in line with the latest government guidance.” He said stores had been rearranged so every customer would be greeted at the entrance, where their temperature would be checked and they would be asked to sanitise their hands.Staff will have their temperature checked before entering the stores and will be equipped with protective face shields and perspex screens in front of tills.

By 1pm, two hours after it reopened, a line of about 40 vehicles meant an hour-long roadside wait for burger fans.The branch is among 33 outlets the fast food chain has reopened for drive-through only in London and south-east England as it eases back into business following the loosening of lockdown restrictions.McDonald’s and other fast food chains including Burger King, KFC and Nando’s are trialling a gradual reopening of restaurants to allow staff to get used to new safety measures and practise physical distancing inside.In Bushey, sisters Casey and Alycia Levy, aged 18 and 20, had bought burgers, chicken nuggets and cold drinks as a surprise for their grandparents, who have been isolating for 11 weeks. “They’ve been at home since 1 March, so we wanted to cheer them up,” Alycia said.Matthew Cohen had brought his children Dylan, 7, and Summer, 11, for lunch. “We’ve been missing the sweet and sour sauce with our chicken nuggets,” Cohen said. The family usually visit the drive-through weekly, and had a longer wait than usual, because only one lane was open, but did not find a radical change in the experience.The changes in restaurant operations will be more noticeable for the staff. They now have their temperatures checked when they arrive for a shift, and will be given protective equipment including masks and gloves. They are also protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their fellow workers inside the restaurant’s kitchen.As a McDonald’s employee – his face covered with a face mask and wearing a hi-vis vest – marshalled the queue of cars, other staff members walked the line of vehicles to tell customers they were serving only a limited menu. Clients were asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending was capped at £25 per vehicle.The details of which branches were reopening were kept secret until just 45 minutes before the first customers were served, as McDonald’s tried to avoid a rerun of its experience in France and Switzerland. When drive-throughs were reopened there, the first locations were announced well in advance, leading to queues of up to seven hours.Many customers at Bushey had heard about the reopening on social media and had brought their children for a trip out to buy a meal.By lunchtime, so many vehicles were queueing for the Bushey branch that they were starting to disrupt traffic on the adjoining A41, and the restaurant’s franchise owner and some of his staff enlisted the help of a nearby highway maintenance crew to cordon off part of the road, creating a one-way system.Despite almost two months passing since the government introduced lockdown measures and the closure of seating spaces in all restaurants, some customers were still unsure how to behave. Having ordered burgers from their car window, one mother and son were disappointed not to be able to eat their lunch at a sunny table outside.The fast food chain said it had informed police forces, local authorities and the highways agency in all places where it was due to reopen. At one restaurant, in Peterborough, a police officer called in to check that the agreed vehicle queueing system was in place and that no further crowd control measures were required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f10fa5e828b25cde6e3565e0761b63954974458/0_170_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dc48d8e1e178370b11c08d14e6a9fd","title":"british schools science children education testing tracing","story":"We need to get children back into education, but a locally managed approach using testing and tracing is the only wayThe big debate over the past few days has been whether it’s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren’t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one.Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test, trace, isolate”, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.The tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what’s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government’s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it’s helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain.Two of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes as “the moral intuitions”, the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers placed more emphasis on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask “will this cause harm?”, whereas leavers would be inclined to ask “will something restrict our freedom?”.This emphasis on careharm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions ide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the careharm reasoning is stronger among women. This might help to explain the gender difference in concern around coronavirus, and why male and female leaders have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with vaccine hesitancy, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine.We might disagree with the values underlying people’s political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side – not because they don’t have good ideas, but simply because they are in the “other” camp.In other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more persuasive communication. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues have argued that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security.Finding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a “nudge”. The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let’s set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity.Chicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the concept of nudge as a reconciliation between “paternalistic” state intervention and the liberty of the inidual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people’s environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important, but are still more likely to do so if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital.As we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated. Governments have a huge role to play in structuring our daily environments to make it easy to engage in the behaviours we need to engage in. Telling people to follow “common sense” is likely to prove a lot less effective than making masks easily available, or making hand sanitisers more widespread in public buildings.There is no quick fix to Get Corona Done. However, behavioural science can help create new habits to slow the rate of infection until a vaccine is created – and a little bit of understanding of the values behind people’s beliefs will go a long way to avoid the spread of further ision.• Lee de Wit is a lecturer in political psychology at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cbe536b81df3ff74ed1b22d5aa8dfa095d14a3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007dd3a6eff53c8dc8d4ab53aff9524d","title":"post coronavirus uk alliances stand up china us","story":"Covid-19 has seen China supplant the US in the global power league. Alliances are now crucial to reject the superpower’s bullyingAmid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic’s role in boosting the global heft of China.The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration’s US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee to assess Covid-19’s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China’s rise.Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the “belt and road” strategies, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China’s “wolf-warrior” diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump’s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump’s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China’s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power’s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government’s “integrated review” of Britain’s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain’s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since Tony Blair could write that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic “long game” with China that would give Britain greater political leverage “to bring China into the rules-based international system – through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.” Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain’s leverage in that or any other global order?Johnson’s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach – an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war – that the American diplomat George Kennan crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen – and partly sees itself – as an alliance breaker.China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman Stephen Kinnock made clear this week. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a28733c248f0a7008ee04539dc2a439abb8d44/0_0_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4001c65bd751c3e6b7dcc9bd2e5d9ec7","title":"summer holiday no 10 coronavirus","story":"With coronavirus kiboshing holidays abroad, the government is praying the public will be happy with Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beachWhen coronavirus first arrived in Britain, ministers initially placed their hopes on the summer months offering relief from the pandemic. The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.That wasn’t to be. Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has limited effect on Covid-19’s spread. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars – and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and Italy and Spain aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a “devastating” impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the “slow and steady” path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.Even if talks of “air bridges” – allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece – come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won’t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. “If the R number rises in these countries as a result, we’ll be praised for our response – if it doesn’t, we might start to get some heat,” explains one government figure.The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. “If it rains, we’re fucked,” says one rather blunt Tory MP.“Britain’s going to look like the 1940s this summer,” predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we’re lucky, drive-in cinemas.Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don’t live with.While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won’t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people – whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping – if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season – not just the typical high season of peak summer months – given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it’s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots – it could also be what’s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies – with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there’s a sense that “common sense” will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea06a60a8d38ba94f548f072c334423edf9be54/0_168_5186_3112/master/5186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a31210ff9cb7c0993aa5813245e6d2","title":"the guardian view on uk theatre on the brink","story":"The brilliant creativity of British theatre must be safeguarded – and not just the great national institutionsTheatre has brave new thinking in its bones. What is it, if not the imagining and sharing of alternative worlds? But no amount of creative thinking can change the reality that theatre across the UK is on the brink. It is precisely what makes it so special that makes it so vulnerable – it depends on a real-time, shared experience, with performers and audience at close quarters. Put in economic terms, that means selling a lot of tickets to an audience sitting indoors, very near to each other. Theatres may not be able to reopen fully till at least much later this year, and possibly 2021.With no income coming in, the Globe and the Old Vic in London have sent out warning signals that they are weeks from collapse. Such theatres as these – with no public subsidy – are particularly at risk, being ineligible for emergency funds from Arts Council England. Those supported by public funding are not far behind, despite the furlough scheme: Nuffield Southampton Theatres called in the administrators at the start of the month. This week, the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh announced all jobs are at risk of redundancy.Emergency funding from national arts councils varies among the four nations, but in England, where £160m is being spent by Arts Council England across the board (with £20m going to iniduals artists), organisations will survive only until September at best. And the people who make theatre – actors and directors and writers, but also technicians, composers, designers, musicians, specialist set builders, prop and costume makers – are for the large part freelancers whose livelihoods are, at the best of times, fragile, and have now disappeared. Many have fallen through the gaps of the government help offered to the self-employed.The UK and devolved governments must step in. But it is crucial that any solution protects the whole of British theatre, an ecology through which the smallest experimental fringe company is connected by innumerable threads to the most internationally famous institutions. Safeguarding the most obviously prominent, often London-based organisations for the sake of national prestige would make no sense – the whole network is interdependent. It would also be a political miscalculation: the theatres of the “red wall” constituencies of the Midlands and northern England must not be left behind – nor the small, nimble organisations at the grassroots, which provide the real energy fuelling British theatre.A great irony is that theatre companies have, over the past weeks, made extraordinary theatre work available online, to the delight and solace of audiences. The internet is brimming with material – from something as intimate as Andrew Scott’s spellbinding performance of Simon Stephens’ monologue Sea Wall, to Emma Rice’s joyous adaptation of Angela Carter’s Wise Children. The exuberance, the creativity, the energy of all this is what Britain stands to lose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e29992dd38afb9b16a8f182f46e2f9b5a2fa73c/0_81_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6280b1349e8caab3c7dd3198ebd60d8c","title":"the perfect vegan sausages from a dry mix what other meat free joys of the 70s did i miss","story":"No more Linda McCartneys in our house: I’ll be making my own banging bangers from now on – from a powderI stopped eating meat five and a half years ago after getting close to a lamb in Turkey. I only spent a few minutes with this lamb, whose name, translated, was Courage. But, as these were the closing minutes of the poor lamb’s life, the bond grew very strong, very quickly, before being severed by the knife of its killer. Perhaps, though, the bond is actually as strong as ever, given that I think about him most days.Until that point in my life, I had been a voracious meat-eater. Most evenings, my dinner table resembled Fred Flintstone’s. I am no massive animal rights campaigner. I am quite happy to sit with people who are eating meat, neither do I mind cooking flesh for friends and family if that’s what they want. I fear that makes me the Centrist Dad of vegetarianism. My logic is merely that, as I happen to be able to feed myself very well without any animals dying, I think it is the right thing to do.My conversion seemed to coincide with the moment that plant-only eating passed the tipping point into the mainstream. It turned out that all manner of perfectly good meat substitutes were available in supermarkets, and the range has grown markedly since. All of which makes me feel a bit like a Leicester City fan who only started supporting the club the year they won the Premier League. Fans of other teams have a chant for people like that, to the tune of Bread of Heaven: “Where were you when you were shit?”I would not blame veteran plant-eaters for chanting something similar at me: where were you when vegetarian food was shit? It doesn’t scan as well, but it is a fair question. My answer is that I am beginning to wonder if missing out on the pre-Linda McCartney era was my loss. The more I taste of it, the more I like. A great example is something I had never heard of until last week: Sosmix. This miracle dry mixture is apparently something every 20th-century vegetarian was familiar with.I was bought some last week, and I’ve neither talked of, nor cooked, anything else since. What a miracle has unfolded before me. For the carnivores and fellow new plant-eaters among you, I should say it is a mix of dry ingredients roughly resembling fine muesli. You mix 160g of it with 250ml of water, leave it for five minutes, and then fashion it into sausages. It then says to cook them as normal but, disbelieving it could be this simple, I messed around wrapping them in foil and steaming them for an hour first. I had read somewhere this helps firm up homemade plant sausages. I have since found that even this isn’t necessary with Sosmix.Either way, as my daughters probably wouldn’t say, the resulting bangers are banging. My favourites, until now, have been Plant Pioneers, Quorn or Linda McCartney. But from now on they are strangers to me, because these are right up there. So cheap, too! A kilo of Sosmix costs a tenner, which is enough to make more than 40 sausages. And oh the fun I’ve had flavouring them! Dried mixed herbs worked well, as did my first attempt at a spicier sausage: chilli powder, paprika and cumin. This weekend, I’m planning three new versions featuring sage and onion, smoked tomato and curry.Unaccountably, Sosmix is quite hard to find. You can only buy it online, and it looks like the manufacturer has changed hands a few times, leading to some dark warnings about being sure to buy the original. It is well worth it. I have enough to keep us in vegan sausages until Christmas, when I hope Santa will bring me some more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1dc4b517850bfbb652305662b4da6a2bb5364cd/0_278_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea49bdbf4e3abdeaafa49bf64da608f1","title":"students are you thinking of deferring your entry to university this year","story":"We would like to hear from students who are looking to start their first year at university in SeptemberCambridge University has decided to move all “face-to-face lectures” online for the full 2020-21 academic year.We want to hear from prospective first year students who are thinking of postponing their entry to university this year.Are you thinking of deferring entry or thinking about waiting a year?

Hopefully by later years it’ll be something I can do again, but developing those patient skills early on is really important.”Malik has already undertaken a gap year, so is hesitant to take another year out before starting her degree.“Because medicine is such a long degree, the idea of taking another gap year is not something I’ve really considered,” she said. “All my friends have already begun uni, and in a way, I don’t want to be left behind.”The shift to online teaching has led many to question whether the high tuition fees are worth the education they will receive, with some opting to defer until the following academic year.Dominik Wojciechowski, 21, is due to start a degree in music in September, but is trying to defer. “It’s just a waste of money,” he said. “If you don’t have orchestral classes you don’t get the experience of playing in an orchestra, which would prepare you for your career, and you won’t be able to learn the repertoire and literature of music as well.”Alongside physical distancing, the potential lack of access to facilities and equipment was also a major concern for Wojciechowski.Many students have lost part-time jobs that supported them during university, leaving them struggling to fund their education.Throughout her degree, Amy Tetsola, a 20-year-old marketing student at the University of Leicester, has had a zero-hours contract working various jobs in the hospitality sector. Since the coronavirus pandemic, this work has stopped. Tetsola is concerned about the financial implications of undertaking study without a part-time job, and has decided to defer her final year of study.Like Wojciechowski, she is struggling to reconcile the high tuition fee costs with the education she will receive.“Given my third year is the most important year of my academic career, I don’t want to compromise it by having everything delivered virtually. I’ll pay nearly £10,000 for that year, and I may have to pay full fees for online teaching. It’s not worth taking that chance,” she added. “We’re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call.”Some courses will not allow deferrals because of coronavirus, and for many students, the risk of losing the place is too great to take.“It’s been a dream of mine for a long time to go to Cambridge, and part of me is terrified that if I was to reject the place and try again next year, it would be much more competitive because so many people will have deferred,” said Emily, who is due to start her master’s degree in September.Emily said the loss of her dream university experience is “very, very upsetting”.“Those opportunities for networking are incredibly important, meeting those people is a huge part of the degree,” she said. “How am I mean to make friends sat in a dorm room?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b6bb6266904eb8af69abcd5e3b4792657dcab3/191_272_1356_814/master/1356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f2ec2379f99fc1c5c738597ea7c0fa","title":"koalas localised extinction planned nsw shenhua coalmine","story":"Koalas on the site of the planned Shenhua Watermark coalmine in New South Wales are heading towards localised extinction “even before the mine commences”, according to company documents.Meeting minutes for the mine’s koala technical working group say there has been a steep drop in koala populations at the mine site in the Liverpool Plains.Experts who sit on the working group have raised concerns the clearing of habitat for the project will accelerate this decline at a time when the species is under pressure as a result of bushfires, drought and chlamydia.The Environmental Defenders Office has written to the state government on behalf of the Lock the Gate Alliance, asking it to suspend the approvals process for Shenhua’s koala management plan because the full impact of the project on the threatened species “cannot be adequately assessed” until the damage to koala populations and habitat in NSW caused by the bushfires is fully understood.The EDO has also asked the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to use her powers to step in for other threatened species, including the regent honeyeater and the swift parrot, both of which lost habitat in the fires and were species considered in the original federal assessment of the mine.But Ley has no power in relation to the koala because it was not listed as a threatened species under national environment law when the project was declared a controlled action that required federal environmental approval in late 2011. The koala was listed as a vulnerable species just four months later.Shenhua has until the end of next month to submit environmental management plans and apply for its mining licence or a cancellation clause will be triggered that would effectively allow the state government to terminate the project.As part of its obligations at state level, the company must complete a plan that sets out how it intends to reduce the impact of the mine on koalas.The koala technical working group – which comprises scientists, conservationists, and representatives of the NSW Environment Department and Shenhua – was established to provide advice in this process.“On that trajectory and worst-case scenario, it indicates that the koala is heading to localized extinction even before the mine commences,” the notes state.Valentina Mella is a post-doctoral researcher in animal behaviour and conservation at the University of Sydney and a member of the technical working group. She is part of a team that has been surveying koala populations in the Liverpool Plains, including at the Shenhua site, since 2015.Mella said data suggested there had been a steep decline that would lead to local extinction in the long term, unless a successful vaccine for chlamydia was found.“Maybe if we don’t chop down the trees they need, they can last long enough until we find a cure,” Mella said. “If you already know that they’re in trouble, do you really want to add an additional major issue?”The minutes show experts on the working group have raised repeated concerns with Shenhua about its proposals, including plans to move koalas to other locations and to clear an important habitat corridor for a rail line.A NSW planning department spokeswoman said the company was due to submit its final koala management plan in coming weeks and it would be “carefully reviewed to ensure all conditions of approval are met”.She said that included “maintaining 1,200 hectares of koala habitat on the site, establishing new koala habitat corridors, and rehabilitating the mine to create additional koala habitat in the longer term”. Australia asked if the government would consider the EDO’s request to suspend its assessment of the plan, or if it might vary any of Shenhua’s development conditions, due to the impact of the fires on koala populations.“The department cannot unilaterally modify a valid planning approval,” the department’s spokeswoman said.The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, declined to comment.Deborah Tabart is the chief executive of the Australian Koala Foundation and sits on the working group.She said the situation was “the classic, perfect storm of system failure”.George Woods, the NSW coordinator of the Lock the Gate Alliance, said the mine was “exemplary of a system that’s locking in extinction by not responding to environmental catastrophe as it’s unfolding”.In its submission to the review of the Environment Protection and Bioersity Conservation Act, the organisation highlights the case of the koalas at the Shenhua Watermark site as an example of “cumulative harm” that can come to species if they are listed as threatened after a development has been declared a controlled action (meaning it requires federal assessment) but before it is approved.“This decision can come several years before an approval decision, but if the status of a species or ecological community changes during that time the Act explicitly prevents that altered status from affecting the decision and the assessment,” the submission states.A spokesman for Ley said EPBC assessments could only consider species that were listed as matters of national environmental significance at the time of referral.In the case of Shenhua Watermark, he said, NSW “is expected to give consideration to the impact of the bushfires on species, including koalas, as part of its consideration of Shenhua’s koala management plan”.However, the spokesman said the Act did give the minister some capacity to “vary a project’s conditions of approval” in relation to other listed species “in circumstances where the impact of an action on a matter considered in the original assessment is substantially greater than was identified at the time”.“These are being considered,” he said.Shenhua declined to comment.

The samples were collected by prolific wildlife recordist Lawrence Shove in the 1960s and 1970s and provided to the  by the British Library. This interactive is best experienced with your sound on. As we wake up to an early start around sunrise, many birds are already up and singing at full throat to stake off their territory and attract potential mates.The nightingale likes to hide in thick brush when delivering its powerful song. It can be heard between April and June and is most active at dawn and dusk.The robin is a pugnacious little bird that will try to maintain its territory throughout the year.Fallow deer often stalk the forest at dawn before lying down to ruminate during the day. They give off powerful bellows to establish dominance or signal alarm. Around midday, the forest gets quieter as birds and other small animals are cautious not to attract the attention of predators. But not all animals fall silent … The woodpecker’s distinctive drumming can often be heard during the day. The woodpecker uses its drumming like other birds use their song: to attract mates, defend a territory or summon help.The great tit is known for its vast repertoire of short calls.The grey squirrel spends much of the day scavenging for nuts, fruit and fungi. It will give off loud alarm calls when spotting a predator. As the sun goes down, more animals can be heard stirring in the undergrowth again.  The red fox is an extremely adaptive species not afraid of exploring gardens or farmland. Its diet includes rodents, insects, fruit and vegetables – and sometimes scraps found in the garbage. The elusive pine marten is a close relative of the weasel and critically endangered in England and Wales. It is a stealthy, acrobatic hunter that likes to venture out at dusk. The mole is active for about four hours at a time and then rests for a similar amount of time. It makes shrill chirping noises when alarmed. Many animals awake only after nightfall to move or hunt under cover of darkness. The badger emerges from its underground home after dusk to feed on worms, birds’ eggs or small animals. It is a highly social animal and communicates through chortling sounds. The tawny owl glides almost soundlessly through the night as it looks for prey. The male gives off an eerie hoot when attempting to court a nearby female. Finally, we hear a hedgehog snuffling as it moves through the undergrowth. The hedgehog can also become surprisingly noisy during its lengthy mating ritual. If you enjoyed this interactive, you might find that some of these animals live right on your doorstep.If you decide to exercise outdoors, remember that the government’s coronavirus advice is to stay at home as much as possible. The Welsh and Scottish governments are urging the public to avoid all unnecessary travel. National park authorities in England are telling people not to rush back to beauty spots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea8a1746bb8c8c155fc0f2179a72e6ba2b9a3ba/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ac5fc44c1ddf3264c9e223e136b3e9","title":"kim kardashian wests face masks provoke controversy","story":"The reality star’s non-medical masks, launched through her shapewear company, suggest the line between fashion and necessity is becoming increasingly blurredThe reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process.Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them.But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the ’s request for comment at time of publication.Skims announced that it would donate 10,000 masks to various local relief charities in Los Angeles, where wearing a mask is mandatory if physical distancing is not possible. This public act of generosity has been widely reported, alongside news of sales.A host of other fashion brands have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by rearranging their supply chains to manufacture masks and other pieces of personal protective equipment, in many cases not for profit. At the same time, some large profit-making companies have been accused of “coronawashing” or using the pandemic as a public relations vehicle. Others, such as ASOS and Boohoo, have faced criticism for profiteering from the crisis by making “fashion masks” in leopard and paisley prints that offer little or no proven protection.The Skims masks cost $8 each, and are available in colours named sand, clay, sienna, cocoa and onyx. Given that the masks are “non-medical” – the website cautions that the mask is “not a respirator and will not eliminate the risk of contracting disease or infection” – wearing them would appear to be as much about style as pandemic precaution.There is concern that should mask-wearing become mandatory, this line between necessity and fashion statement is going to blur, and this arm of the industry will get bigger. The masks currently sit under “accessory” on the shapewear label’s site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1361e5ffb5bd7bbf31ad561e15a05d069c8aba/0_398_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37fcae2fb3652674e9ac3567144a2c41","title":"we cant be silent how fashion is speaking up about covid racism","story":"Asian American designers such as Phillip Lim and Prabal Gurung are using their clothes to fight against the rising tide of corona-related xenophobia and help the relief effort“The upturn of violence and discrimination really hit way too close to home for all of us,” says the US designer Phillip Lim. “When we see people who look like us, our friends and family members, colleagues being attacked, we can’t be silent.”Lim’s 3.1 Phillip Lim label and Prabal Gurung are among the fashion brands contributing clothing, including t-shirts and hats, with proceeds going to the All Americans Movement, a campaign to help those from marginalised communities who have been affected by Covid-19.“It’s a cross-cultural movement, which reinforces the idea that there are many different ways to be American,” says Gurung, the Nepalese-American fashion designer who is based in New York. “It is an idea: a confluence of different cultures, communities and dreams. When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.”It is a potent message, in the climate of racially based Covid incidents and Donald Trump labelling the pandemic the “Chinese virus”. “Assigning a race to this virus is exactly the type of misinformation we have to fight against to ensure we are well informed,” says Gurung. Lim agrees that the incendiary language around Covid is having a toxic effect. “It is frustrating to watch the leaders of this country blatantly gaslight the American public with this type of xenophobic rhetoric,” he says.“I genuinely believe that most people want to do good,” says Gurung. “That said, I was not surprised by the racism. While I see the incredible beauty of this country, I have always been aware of the cracks in its foundation and the systemic racism that pulses under the surface.”Gurung has been political in his work before. He sent models down the runway with statement T-shirts featuring slogans such as “The future is female” and “Our bodies, our choices, our power” and “I am an immigrant”. He stopped his 10th anniversary New York fashion week show being held at Hudson Yards when he found out that the owner hosted a Trump fundraiser. Provocatively, in the era of Trump’s immigration ban, his SpringSummer 20 show featured a erse cast of models wearing prom-like sashes asking: “Who gets to be American?”.He said the idea for the collection came to him while he was in a business meeting. “I was sitting across from a group of businessmen, telling them about my goal to redefine the Americana aesthetic, and one of them said: ‘You don’t look American, so how can you define what America is?’” He said this exchange, along with Time magazine’s Who Gets To Be American cover, set off the central idea for the collection.“The sashes were a powerful visual moment, with all these erse models from all over the world representing the different possible identities and stories of living the American dream,” he says, adding that the collection was about “questioning who gets to claim that identity in today’s climate”.This political moment in fashion also marks a generational shift. “In Asian culture, our parents tell us to keep our heads down,” says Lim. “Don’t make problems and ignore racism so that it will just go away it’s so ingrained in our subconscious as a means of survival. In our current situation, that mentality has the opposite effect. Being quiet strips away your right for a voice and it takes away the opportunity to be seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e52f4e6e5bfc30d8b452092ffdc8368b31902a/145_69_1467_881/master/1467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20669199e38db463fbf519d2e7f1cf29","title":"edge of extinction review","story":"Some well-crafted action scenes are thwarted by a stilted script in Andrew Gilbert’s plodding post-apocalyptic thriller This post-apocalyptic survivalist thriller, set in rural Britain, is both violent and depressing, with some iffy line-readings, weird script moments and untied plot strands. It isn’t badly shot by any means, with one or two effective action scenes and interesting use of remote locations, but it takes two ploddingly long hours to tell a cumbersomely inflated and often dull story, which even at the finish line has to be wound up pretty arbitrarily.We are in a lawless, chaotic land where food, water and shelter are grimly scarce. A lone inidual (Luke Hobson), haunted by his tragic past, makes common cause with a young woman (Georgie Smibert) and a desperate, angry man (Chris Kaye) to win out against a terrifying band of marauding cannibals and rapists, led by a brutal figure known as The Beast (Bryn Hodgen). They also get help from a couple, played by Nicholas Chambers and Susan Lee Burton who have their own reasons for fearing and hating these evil monsters.The strangest moment comes when when Smibert’s character is briefly imprisoned as a sex slave by The Beast, and she briefly befriends another young woman chained up for the same purpose. Later, the couple reveal their daughter was taken and could still be in The Beast’s compound. Did these two plot points have a relationship in earlier script drafts? The way they played out here is disconcerting and inconclusive.We are of course heading for a monumentally horrible, medieval-style bloodbath, and the film delivers on that score, but the dialogue scenes are leaden and it is impossible to feel any sympathy or interest in anyone here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/518dea3daac515af63cfe10fcda9e6565a4a9502/0_79_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=845e4d7bba2ff61706be02b8dedc7625","title":"the lovebirds review netflix issa rae kumail nanjiani michael showalter","story":"A bickering couple are forced to run for their lives in Michael Showalter’s likably lewd screwball crime caperCreating unforgettable cinema isn’t easy, but neither is creating forgettable cinema: goofy, likable comedy of the sort that slides through your mind, leaving behind that most easily patronised of movie effects: a good feeling. The Lovebirds, from screenwriter Aaron Abrams and director Michael Showalter, is like this, a wacky romcom romp (rompcom?) showcasing a bizarre, spoofy twist on Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. It’s something you might watch on a plane. Right now, that’s no putdown: an unappreciated comfort from happier times.Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae play Jibran and Leilani, two young professionals in New Orleans who hooked up three years before the action begins, moved in together shortly afterwards and found that their relationship began to deteriorate.Domestic intimacy has made each partner profoundly unimpressed by the other’s professional life. Jibran is a self-described documentary film-maker who is reluctant to show his great work to anyone and will reveal only that it is about financial irregularity in the world of education, a subject that stuns Leilani with pure boredom and irritation. As for Leilani, she works in an ad agency and owes her career to a commercial for body wash, based on her own experience in college of experimentally having sex with an unattractive man due to his pleasant skin aroma.Driving one evening to a dinner party, they have another argument and realise simultaneously their relationship is over. Jibran takes his eyes off the road to gaze sadly into the eyes of his now ex-partner who gazes sadly into his. There is melancholy and even grief in both – and then they crash into a murderous criminal situation involving an occult secret society. Jibran and Leilani must run for their lives, and use their wits to solve a crime that the cops might be about to pin on them. Could it be that this appalling new scenario will reignite their love?From here on, the movie depends on simply getting the couple skittering from one farcical situation to another, to the accompaniment of an ironised bantery-squabbly argument about what they are going to do: the 21st-century equivalent of screwball. They argue about the meaning of “fuckboy” they argue about the element of spontaneity necessary for an orgy they argue about whether it is pretentious to call a fire escape a “catwalk” they argue about the lyrics, “Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do.”There is a strange moment when they are imprisoned by the bad guys and threatened with a certain type of torture: being kicked by a horse, which has apparently been brought here for the specific purpose of meting out barnyard related violence. Then it is over, and the surreality consists in never giving the horse a backward glance.Nanijani and Rae work well together, although “chemistry” is perhaps a stretch: there was more of a genuine romantic spark between Nanijani and his erstwhile co-star Zoe Kazan in his 2017 film The Big Sick, which was also directed by Showalter, and that probably had more jeopardy and more about being in love. The Lovebirds is pretty lightweight – which is how it can take off.• The Lovebirds is on Netflix from 22 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e312f7c296e44cebfcedb09a4d8cd76860324294/0_401_6124_3676/master/6124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54569353936ae37d7fbc7a158ccbdaf9","title":"kim joys recipe for sticky toffee pudding and a biscuit groundhog","story":"The current situation demands comfort food – and friendly biscuit groundhogsSticky toffee pudding is the comfort food we need right now and groundhogs reflect how I feel, since every day seems to be merging into one.

Atalanta’s manager is talking about how he motivates players. He describes how he often puts up messages in the changing room and one of the most recent, he says, was from Michael Jordan: “Twenty-six times, I have been trusted with the final shot and I missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And this is why I succeed.”Gasperini pauses and says: “But the best one is about the wolf pack.” The wolf pack? “I posted a picture of a wolf pack in the changing room. There are wolves at the front, some in the middle and one at the back. The ones up front can set the pace in the beginning. The next wolves are the strongest, they are the ones who must protect everyone if they are attacked. The ones in the centre are always protected.“Then there are another five strong ones further back to protect an attack from there. The last one is the boss and he ensures no one is left behind. He keeps everyone united and is always prepared to run everywhere to protect the whole group. The message is that a leader doesn’t just stay up front he takes care of the team and this is what I want from my players.”It is an unusual message to send a group of highly-paid professionals but it is working. What Gasperini wants from his players, he gets. Before coronavirus struck, Atalanta were having the best season in their 113-year-old history. They are one of four teams through to the Champions League quarter-finals – with Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and Atlético Madrid – and on course to qualify for next season’s competition.Then there are the goals. They have scored the most in Italy since the start of last season. This campaign there have been 70 in 25 league games. Three times they have scored seven – against Udinese, Torino and Lecce. Two of those games were away. Milan and Parma were beaten 5-0.Gasperini is relentless in his demands, not unlike Jürgen Klopp. Training is merciless and some players have not enjoyed it. Christian Vieri once said that Gasperini “will destroy you in training” but Atalanta’s manager says: “During training, my players need to struggle those who aren’t used to working hard scare me. But from the struggle, victories are born. If you don’t run in training then you don’t run during the game. Then, of course it is important to have fun in training too because from that comes the style of play and the quality.”Gasperini has created a remarkable team from an unusual set of players. The captain is the remarkable Papu Gómez, a 32-year-old Argentinian who joined from Metalist Kharkiv for £4m in 2014. Another key forward, Josip Ilicic, is also 32 and arrived from Fiorentina for £5m in 2017.The former Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini, former Middlesbrough midfielder Marten de Roon and Mario Pasalic, a Croat who belongs to Chelsea but has found a home in Bergamo on his fifth loan away from the London club since joining in 2014, are other key components. Robin Gosens arrived from Ereisie side Heracles for less than £1m, yet is one of Europe’s most sought-after left-backs now while Bergamo-born Mattia Caldara is back at Atalanta after spells at Juventus and Milan and has been outstanding at centre-back.These players are in the best form of their lives, but why? “There is a secret,” the 62-year-old Gasperini says. “When you reach the maturity necessary to understand that hard work leads to results, you no longer feel tired. Let’s not lose track of the fact that footballers don’t train as hard as other athletes, where the training is tough and intense. My players must think of that and go at it harder. We never had the means for big investments, so we had to find young players in Europe with the same philosophy: able to adapt to our style of play, winning mentality, offensive-minded and willing to work hard. Those who believe in that is one of us, those who are afraid leave.”Gómez once said Gasperini trains players so hard that a match feels like a day off. “With Papu we are talking about an extraordinary player who had not achieved his potential because he never trained well,” Gasperini says. “When he started training better he raised his level to become one of the best in Europe. He wasted time because training makes you into a champion: he always had everything to become one.“Ilicic is another one. We used to call him ‘Josip the Grandma’ because he was just going around being nice to everyone. We had to convince him to increase his efforts at training. He was missing that mental step but once he changed his mindset we stopped calling him grandma, now we call him ‘The Professor’. He realised that every training session is fun and from that decision he was reborn. Five goals in the Champions League this season is a superb effort.”Life has not always been straightforward for Gasperini. After a decent playing career, which started at Juventus’ youth teams and included 59 Serie A appearances for Pescara, he joined Juve’s coaching setup, looking after their under-14s, under-17s and the Primavera squads (under-20s). Successful spells at Genoa earned him the nickname “Gasperson” with a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson because of the team’s style.However, in 2011, when given his chance at a big club, Inter, it went horribly wrong. He lasted less than three months, having failed to win a game, sacked after a demoralising defeat by promoted Novara. As fate would have it though, his dismissal led to one of his favourite moments in football.“I had just been sacked at Inter because I didn’t have the same vision as the management. Then I received a beautiful message: Pep Guardiola wanted to meet me and he invited me to watch his training sessions at Barcelona. It was a very tough moment in my career and to see how an extraordinary manager like Guardiola stayed close to me at that time, it tells you the type of person he is. He made me very happy.”Even at Atalanta, Gasperini initially had problems. At the start of the 2016-17 season the newly appointed manager lost four of his first five league games. There was again talk of the sack when he threw caution to the wind and gave several young players a chance against Napoli, one of the best teams at the time. Atalanta won 1-0 and have not looked back.“I decided to go down this path,” he says. “I’ll make it until the end with my ideas I’m ready to risk everything because I believe in it. We started Mattia Caldara, Roberto Gagliardini, Andrea Petagna and Andrea Conti and other young players with only a few Serie A games between them. We won with a fantastic performance that no one forgets about since that was the beginning of the growth. The beginning for the historical Atalanta way.“I had the idea to play youngsters right away. In Italy, Bergamo is considered a very important place for work, industry and productivity. I wanted to have a project tied to young players, preferably raised in the Atalanta academy, which is exceptional. For too long the backbone of the team was too old so I tried to avoid relegation with a different method: to have full confidence in the young players, develop them and prioritise quality football.”Tactically, Gasperini rarely deviates from 3-5-23-4-3, although there is a lot more positional rotation now. His high-pressing game is unusual for the Italian league. He wants players to look for space and has even told them that watching the referee can help: “Finding space is fundamental for a player so I told them: ‘Look at the referee, he’s never being marked, he’s always in an ideal position to see the game!’ Papu, in particular, has taken on this advice and it has really helped him.”His wife, Cristina, has said that he sometimes wakes in the night and grabs his computers and starts writing notes. “Yes,” he says and laughs. “With my computer at night or with my blackboard I’m always studying for solutions for the next game and only when I believe they will work will we start training.”In Italy, Gasperini has always been seen as the man with the three centre-backs. It has almost defined him. He has been criticised by some for sticking by tactics associated with catenaccio. “I’m proud of this, because I suggested the three-man defence many years ago when I was coaching in Juventus’ youth system. Back then I was told it was too defensive. I proved it was the opposite: the three defenders participate in the run of play, they are trained to be involved offensively.“The formation doesn’t matter, but rather with how many players do you attack or defend. If I had to sum up my defensive philosophy in one phrase it would be that I don’t believe and I will never believe in the concept of waiting for your opponent to make a mistake: I think you must try to steal the ball to attack.”Atalanta finished fourth in 2016-17, seventh the following campaign and third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started by losing 4-0 at Dinamo Zagreb, 2-1 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk and 5-1 at Manchester City but reached the last 16 by drawing against Manchester City and winning their two remaining games. “I always tell my players: we never lose, we either win or learn,” Gasperini says.Guardiola has said playing against Gasperini’s Atalanta is like “going to the dentist”. The Italian approves: “That is my objective: create a team that would make any opponent struggle. Those who play against us must run a lot and be bothered. I think the dentist metaphor, it is perfect.”Valencia were vanquished 8-4 on aggregate in the Champions League last 16. And then everything stopped. Gasperini remembers returning to Bergamo from the second leg in Spain. “It felt like we were in a country torn apart by war. Everything happened so quickly: just a few days before there was no feeling of what could happen. I remember when we arrived in Valencia, we found a city filled with people celebrating in the streets or outside the stadium, while in Bergamo there were the first indications the situation was critical. When we came back to Bergamo we realised how much had changed in just two days. We went from euphoria to fear in the  of 48 hours.”Gasperini is struggling to find the words to describe the past two months in Bergamo. “This has been something extraordinary, unexplainable with words. Bergamo has been at the centre of this awful coronavirus. It hit our city deeply and caused so many deaths … I’ll never forget the sirens we heard in the centre of Bergamo for the rest of my life.”When matches resume Gasperini knows what he will tell his team. “I will put the emotional aspect right, front and centre. These players have a great bond with Bergamo: the city and the fans. I will talk emotionally and my sentiment will be this: Bergamo suffered a lot, this is our moment to make them smile again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecddd6081682b80629347e1065441f422aab0c4e/0_191_4668_2802/master/4668.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f286707368166f039bd92cc7df2b2847","title":"children of darfur revisiting those orphaned by the conflict","story":"Photojournalist Paddy Dowling travelled to Sudan to find out what happened to those growing up in the midst of genocideThe Darfur genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 300,000 civilians, forced 1.6 million people to flee their homes inside the country and a further 600,000 refugees to spill across borders of neighbouring countries.By April 2003, Darfur’s reckoning had arrived. “Devils on horseback” – tribal militia, who dismounted, traded spears for Kalashnikovs and climbed aboard Land Cruisers. Now government-backed, highly mobile and without mercy or conscience, Janjaweed rebels had answered the president’s call-to-arms, bolstering support for the Sudanese army’s counter-insurgency to ethnically cleanse the uprising of Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribal minorities which were aligned with the Sudan Liberation MovementArmy (SLMA) and Justice Equality Movement groups.Following aerial bombardment by the Sudanese army, Janjaweed rebels spilled through the villages. They killed, raped, looted and burned – and they abducted boys as child soldiers.It is widely documented that children affected by the Darfur genocide were subjected to all of the UN’s “six grave violations against children during armed conflict”: killing or maiming of children recruitment or use of child soldiers rape and other forms of sexual violence against children abduction of children attacks against schools or hospitals and the denial of humanitarian access to children.During the genocide, people under siege in the remote villages of Kebkabiya, north Darfur, home to predominantly Fur and Zaghawa tribes, woke to the sound of gunfire and the screams of villagers. Khadija Abdullah, 35, witnessed her husband Ahmed leave their home never to return. He had gathered with the men of the village. All they had to defend themselves were primitive agricultural tools and they were killed where they stood. Families that were able escaped into night with just the clothes they wore.Displacement during the conflict often occurred either in anticipation of attacks or, for Khadija, after the event that left her grieving, terrified and fleeing with her three children to safety.Sudan’s former administration both instigated the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and prevented its resolution. Delivering aid in Sudan has not been without challenge. Strategies to delay, limit and deny access by aid agencies to civilians in need are well documented.Today the security situation in the Darfur region remains unstable. More than 8 million people are in need of assistance. Urgent humanitarian intervention and protection of the most marginalised is required to prevent paralysing the generations that follow.Sumbul Rizvi, the UN refugee agency’s principal adviser on internal displacement, who was stationed in a remote West Darfur field office from 2007 to 2009, says humanitarian intervention for the most vulnerable, including separated and orphaned children, was part of the UNHCR response. “We work with affected populations and their host communities to provide shelter, coordinate the work of partner agencies, and ensure that IDP camps and sites receive the attention they deserve.”“The protection of children cannot be in isolation of their communities, who may continue to be exposed to risks even in displacement,” she says. “Ensuring protection and solutions for IDPs in Darfur is vital for a peaceful future for Sudan.”International NGO Qatar Charity has worked with Sudan’s governments past and present to protect the fatherless or orphaned young people in Darfur through its “Rofaqaa” sponsorship programme since the conflict began. The scheme to date has ensured the provision of shelter, food, clean water, access to education and protection to more than 3,500 orphaned children in Darfur and 12,244 across Sudan.However Sudan’s social welfare ministry estimated that orphaned or fatherless children of conflict numbered 45,000 in 2015 in South Darfur alone.Mohamed Al Ghamdi, director of external affairs for Qatar Charity, says: “Our child protection strategy supports the continued UN-led international development plan for Darfur, by implementing a large number of projects for the reconstruction of the region in partnership with the UN Development Program and the Qatar Fund for Development … with the aim of promoting peace and development.” Rahman Ali, 16, was only months old when he was carried to safety in the arms of his mother, Khadija, from their besieged village in North Darfur where his father was killed. For 10 years he was a beneficiary of the Rofaqaa programme. He hopes to contribute to promoting the peace that he says his country so badly needs.However a key prerequisite for long-term peace and stability in Darfur is disarmament.The Darfur peace agreements of 2006 and 2011 both required the disarmament and demobilisation of Janjaweed militia along with SLMA and various rebel groups. While these were seen as steps in the right direction, to deliver successful demilitarisation there must be significant provision for alternative livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants. Should this not happen, the risk remains of re-recruitment to other factions, perpetuating a cycle of insecurity.Indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity and deposed, convicted and incarcerated in a coup in Khartoum last year, former president Omar al-Bashir’s tenure has been marked by murder and genocide and left a legacy of families traumatised and destitute.The pro-democracy revolution of 2019 brought change to Khartoum, and if Sudan’s transitional government can resist being drawn into foreign conflicts and instead provide a realistic prospect of return for the displaced, then perhaps establishing a new roadmap for peace in the region may be possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012285ac4bf79bff88e80860c4ca805cce3a3d85/0_17_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=299283b67bd175cef55522528d09c29e","title":"egypt doctors ppe testing coronavirus","story":"Medics increasingly at odds with government that is urging citizens to ‘coexist’ with Covid-19Egyptian doctors are increasingly at odds with their own government on the country’s coronavirus outbreak, pleading for protections and a full lockdown even as the authorities urge people to learn to “coexist” with Covid-19.A wave of government propaganda has hailed healthcare workers as the “white army”, a reference to their white coats. But some of them told the  they lacked protective equipment and were struggling to get vital tests for themselves and patients.“The situation is deteriorating. The nurses and doctors are very scared because we are not protected,” said a nurse at a hospital in Imbaba, Giza. “We are treated the same way patients are treated. If we complain of symptoms, we are asked to go home and quarantine, but we are not allowed to be tested.”In early May a ministry of health official told a parliamentary committee that quarantine hospitals were full, and doctors complained on social media of having to turn infected people away.“Some doctors say those who had symptoms earlier are much luckier than us, as if you got Covid-19 earlier, you got a hospital place,” said one medical worker at a Giza hospital. “If you get it nowadays, you won’t get a place.”“Hospitals are collapsing. They have to turn away people who come in with symptoms, but these people have no other options as all places are full.”Egypt’s health ministry spokesman, Khaled Megahed, was not available when contacted for comment.The syndicate head, Hussein Khairy, and Cairo chapter head Sherine Ghaleb wrote to the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, in early May demanding a full lockdown for the last two weeks of the Ramadan holy month to deal a “swift knockout” to the virus, warning of a surge in cases if no further action was taken. The government declined to impose a lockdown, and health committee members stressed the need to protect Egypt’s fragile economy by “coexisting with the virus” while maintaining social distancing measures.Officials imposed a nighttime curfew in late March, then it reduced it by two hours at the end of April. Shopping malls, banks and mass transit systems stayed open even as case numbers grew. Government officials have declared a new 5pm to 6am curfew during the upcoming six-day Eid al-Fitr break, including the temporary closure of shops and beaches.While health ministry and cabinet officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to “coexist” with the virus, Madbouly has declared that the country will “return to normal” after the Eid holiday. Citizens must wear face masks in public, he said, but the government will now consider reopening restaurants, gyms and places of worship.Multiple Egyptian officials have blamed citizens for the spread of the virus despite the lax restrictions, including the head of the cabinet’s crisis management unit, who lamented the “lack of commitment from some citizens”.The country has 1.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and recently accepted a $2.8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund to aid an economy where a third of citizens live below the poverty line, unable to abstain from daily low-paid work.“We do not want to be called the ‘white army’,” said a doctor at the Hussein University hospital in Cairo. “We want the same social protection and financial rights that the army and officials have. Believe me, doctors do not want songs or titles – we just want to be able to do our job safely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ba0987f9bcfffa5a996f6705a75e7515615269/159_0_4866_2920/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=888e7a029d158e226c130a8b424c1cee","title":"kelloggs pulls pringles advert from pe with joe wicks","story":"YouTube ad dropped after claim of ‘irresponsible marketing’ towards childrenPringles-owner Kellogg’s is dropping advertisements for the snacks from the popular PE With Joe exercise sessions on YouTube, after the fitness classes – originally aimed at adults – were extended to children during the lockdown.The Advertising Standards Authority has decided not to pursue a formal regulatory investigation into the issue following one complaint, but health campaigners accused the food company of “irresponsibly” advertising Pringles to families on Joe Wicks’s Body Coach YouTube channel.At the height of lockdown in April, a “pre-programme” ad for Pringles appeared to an unspecified number of the hundreds of thousands of children (and their parents) who tune in to PE with Joe online every weekday morning.The health campaign groups Action on Salt and Sugar and Children’s Food Campaign are urging all food and drink companies to refrain from advertising any food or drink high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) before 9pm across all media platforms during the coronavirus pandemic.They say this should be until the government can revert to plans to introduce a 9pm TV and online watershed on junk food advertising – part of its childhood obesity plan measures which have been paused while Public Health England (PHE) focuses on tackling Covid-19.However, loopholes for online platforms and social media, as well as for peak-time family TV viewing, mean junk food brands and digital marketers can currently find other tactics to lure children in.Barbara Crowther, Children’s Food Campaign spokeswoman, said: “A pop, skip and a jump is a misleading and counterproductive message for industry to be pushing. Placing this ad directly before Joe’s hugely popular children’s daily PE class is a total betrayal of his work, and highly insensitive, irresponsible marketing. Children don’t need more salt, more saturated fat, more sugar, more excess calories being pushed to them during a pandemic, or indeed at any time.“Children are even more of a captive audience during this lockdown, and we are hugely concerned they are still being subjected to unhealthy food advertising like this. The food industry and government focus should be on building up people’s health and resilience, not undermining it.”Kellogg’s said in a statement: “It was not our intention to advertise Pringles to a younger audience. We are careful about where we place our advertising as we know we have a responsibility to act in the right way. “Joe’s fitness channel has historically been aimed at adults which was the case when we placed our advert on it (booked on 18 March). His audience shifted recently with the launch of ‘PE With Joe’.“As soon as we were made aware that the audience of his channel had changed, we took steps to remove our advertising and we have put measures in place to prevent a repeat.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7e920b127366f18089a49c639f0bcb3b7300f1/0_297_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9bebd00fddcea5124ba790955e95d6","title":"uk hot weather and social distancing in pictures","story":"As lockdown restrictions in England were relaxed and temperatures climbed to 28.2C, people headed for beaches and parks, leading to concerns about social distancing.

As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship.

These are the so-called exit and entry declaration forms that the former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay revealed would be needed for goods traded in both directions. Gove’s pledge not to apply tariffs on goods transported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain complies with the spirit of the deal struck between Johnson and the EU. But it could set him on a collision course with Brussels, which had envisaged that customs controls would apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, with rebates on tariffs for goods that did not go on to the Republic of Ireland.Sources say the government has come under pressure from big supermarket chains among other businesses who have argued that if they are delivering consignments to shoppers in Northern Ireland, a tariff-charge and charge-back arrangement would lead to costly and unnecessary paperwork.Gove promised the checks would involve “the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences for business and traders, particularly those carrying out their affairs entirely within the UK customs territory”.The government has said, however, that “some new administrative process” will apply for traders because the deal requires the UK to apply EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. #The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, welcomed the plan, revealing discussions on agrifood had been “difficult and sensitive”. But she warned the UK deal must ensure it “does not saddle inidual Northern Ireland businesses with further costly administrative burdens”.Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Belfast South, said Gove had “finally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape” for businesses and warned that “castles in the air” such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea.Sinn Féin said the checks showed the “forked tongue” approach of the UK government.Discussing the papers in the Commons, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: “We welcome the statement today but it does expose the broken promises made by the prime minister ... Even now, many fear that the government are not willing to admit the full extent of those. We have seven months to get this right and we must.”Business leaders also gave the plan a cautious welcome. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a “positive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls”, but that the language was so “loose” in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU’s court.Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. “The UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point, but there are still many questions that are left unanswered.”An EU spokesman said the commission welcomed the proposal and would study it in detail.“We have said we can provide certain flexibilities in terms of customs checks, but they have to fit with the union’s customs code, because the Irish border is the EU border, so the union customs code applies,” a second EU official said.The document emerged as the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned the government that the next round of negotiations on the future relationship must bring “new dynamism in order to avoid a stalemate”. He was responding to a letter from his UK counterpart David Frost , who accused Brussels of treating the UK as an “unworthy” partner.Frost’s letter went down badly in Brussels, where EU officials said it would have been better to save such conversations for the privacy of negotiations. In a pointed criticism made in his own reply - by letter - Barnier said an exchange of letters was “not necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d5497b4843ddf4f33127181fedc863b0893561/0_106_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1496355fc91fb55912c81bd15d457d26","title":"ministers overruled permanent secretaries 11 times pandemic","story":"Directions making secretaries of state solely accountable were used to force through spending pledges Ministers responding to the coronavirus pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered their departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, a report by Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found.In its first assessment of the government’s finances since responses began four months ago, the National Audit Office (NAO) disclosed that permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were conducted quickly and without the usual “value for money” checks.Secretaries of state issued ministerial directions to force the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable for the decisions, auditors said. There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government.“Ministerial directions have been sought and granted to exceed departmental expenditure limits authorised by parliament for 2019-20 to support urgent spend and because it had not been possible for departments to carry out as full an appraisal of the value for money of some schemes as would usually be undertaken,” the report said.A report released on Thursday found that the government had pledged more than £124bn in extra spending to tackle the virus and its economic consequences. A week ago, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, said the measures would total £123bn, up from £103bn in late April.Auditors found that ministers made more than 500 announcements between 31 January and 4 May on its response to the pandemic. Of the £124.3bn of programmes, initiatives and spending commitments, £111.3bn was for grants and other payments, £5bn for loans, and £8bn for increases to benefits. The figure does not include the loss of receipts to the Treasury worth an estimated £4.4bn, most of which takes the form of deferred tax payments.Among the spending commitments made by the government was £6.6bn for health and social care measures, which was dwarfed by a promise of £82.2bn for businesses. Another £19.5bn was pledged to support iniduals through measures such as benefits, and £15.8bn for other public services.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “The scale and nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s response is unprecedented in recent history. This report outlines the range of measures taken by government to date and where financial support has been targeted.“It also forms the basis for a substantial programme of independent reports from the National Audit Office to parliament and the public on how the money has been spent and the lessons learned.”In a separate development, figures released on Wednesday showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit increased to 2.1 million in April. The rise of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b32516ba31154a3a6ec96a3ceb8cf6ed490eb5/78_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6097d3c8c0c5f22b50ac8ef95a11db69","title":"nasa new space treaty artemis accords moon mission lunar safety zones","story":"US accused by Russia of trying to circumvent 1967 treaty banning ownership of areas of the moonCountries joining Nasa’s exploration of the moon will be asked to sign up to a series of guiding principles known as the Artemis accords.

They commit the partners to using open international standards to allow machinery and equipment to function easily together, to provide emergency assistance to other astronauts and to mitigate the creation of space debris.Where the accords are likely to become controversial is that they appear to allow the use of lunar resources for commercial gain, and they seek to establish “safety zones” around landing sites, which could be interpreted as de facto ownership of areas of the moon, which is forbidden by the outer space treaty.

But, unexpectedly, The Last Dance has made me gravitate towards LeBronI am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan. You see, I was born in Chicago a few years before he arrived in town and I came of age as he himself blossomed from a college hero into a global icon. Somewhere deep inside an armoire drawer, I have a t-shirt that reads: “Sorry Sir Charlie, You Can’t Be Like Mike” – a disintegrating curbside souvenir from Game 3 of the 1993 NBA finals, one of a dozen-odd Bulls games I was lucky enough to attend during the team’s storybook run. When ESPN announced plans for The Last Dance documentary, I felt vindicated. Here, at last, was the Air-tight argument that would put basketball’s all important greatest of all time debate to rest. LeBron James stans would have no choice but to bow down to the man who unironically calls himself “Black Jesus”.Rightfully, I should be basking in Jordan’s mandate. But truth be told I have never been more conflicted.When I was a kid, it was enough to take Jordan at face value. As far as I knew, he was an otherworldly basketball player whose vast skill owed as much to natural talent as sweat equity, and whose clutch gene traced to a never-say-die attitude. Sure, there were reports of him sparring with management and tangling with teammates. And sure, there was more recent evidence of him snubbing selfie-seeking rappers, stiffing kids out of free Air Jordans and doubling down on grudges in maybe the most bitter hall of fame speech ever delivered. But it was difficult to argue with the results.Forget growing the NBA globally. Jordan was an excuse to put off homework for a few hours, a reason to get together with friends – a blissful ersion for me as my parents went through a lengthy orce. He was an uncomplicated superstar for a relatively quiet time in history when wars were over in a month and the greatest question facing humanity was whether Ross and Rachel would end up together. It was clear to everyone that we were living in a moment.But now that the moment has passed, who could appraise Jordan on his basketball skill alone anymore? As much as The Last Dance tried to keep a tight focus on the court, with Jordan the executive producer hand-checking the viewer all the while, I couldn’t help but note the many belittling references to his “supporting cast” or the villainizing of Bulls GM Jerry Krause – who, it should be noted, is dead and unable to defend himself. I watched Jordan dismiss his 80s-era teammates as womanizing cokeheads and take pride in bullying benchwarmer Scott Burrell and Steve Kerr. I watched him explain away his famous “Republicans buy sneakers too” line as a joke.More to the point: I watched Jordan speak adoringly about his parents and brother and the off-duty Chicago cops in his entourage without really making much mention of his three adult children. In fact, I was convinced that was where the documentary was headed after Jordan’s passionate soliloquy on the price of winning. But the kids only appear briefly toward the end of the series. Certainly, when it came to shutting out the distractions of the world, nobody did it better than MJ. But we don’t live in that world anymore. Hence why, an adult now, I find myself gravitating more and more toward James.At worst James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him. And then he went well beyond even that. He forced his high school friends on his early money minders, and today they are part of his billion-dollar enterprise. He married his high school sweetheart and can reliably be seen embarrassing his three kids on the family’s Taco Tuesday night he waffles openly between kicking himself for passing his name to his first born-son and flogging himself to hang around the league long enough to play with him. He denounces the unjust killings of unarmed black men, tangles with the commander-in-chief – he built a school in his hometown before jetting off to Los Angeles, for goodness sakes. At the very least he should have drawn even with Jordan in the ESPN poll’s “positive off-court impact” category.As for on the court, well, James sees himself more clearly as MJ’s teammate than his rival. “Me personally, the way I play the game – team first – I feel like my best assets work perfectly with Mike,” James said in a video released Monday on Uninterrupted’s YouTube channel. “It would’ve been a whole ‘nother level with me being that point forward alongside of him during those Chicago runs.”Doubtless many old school basketball fans will read that statement as an indictment of the present generation of NBA stars who would sooner consolidate primacy in free agency than battle one another for it on court. And 10-year-old me probably would have scoffed at it, too. But now that I’m four times as old and a father myself? How could I not think the guy who builds bridges would make a better role model for my son than the guy who would torch anything that lies in his path?That is not to say one player is better than the other. On that score it’s a shame that basketball isn’t more like football, where intergenerational talents are seen for what they truly are: descendants of the same line. Just as there’s no Tom Brady without Joe Montana, there’s no LeBron without Jordan. There’s no Kobe Bryant, a GOAT challenger whose copycatting of Jordan I once found as grating as nails on a chalkboard. But when Bryant explained, in footage shot for The Last Dance before his death this year, that his career was essentially a love letter to Jordan, all I could take away was regret. Clearly, eternal greatness doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. It could just be a pleasant distraction, a standard to aspire. It could just be a body of work to appreciate in its time that encapsulated a moment that won’t soon be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b905bf401a6c610c6c1da96b42d556d433221cb/0_0_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=167a742fdf2850e55256cd1036ff5b7a","title":"cricket obsession ball shines saliva icc covid 19","story":"Covid-19 has caused the ICC to step in but players have tried various means to manipulate the ball and help their bowlersFor the casual observer the discussion about cricket-ball maintenance must seem bizarre given all the other issues surrounding the sport: cricket is faced by potential bankruptcy, the necessity of biosecure stadiums and a debate over whether it is appropriate to play in them. Yet in such uncertain times we seem to be just as concerned about the relative merits and dangers of applying saliva and sweat to a cricket ball.In other sports no one spends much time contemplating the ball. Tennis players can be seen asking for three of them and then discarding one before serving, but the impression is that that this has more to do with superstition than anything else. Footballers are not too bothered about which balls they kick. Admittedly England’s rugby players in the 2011 World Cup faced allegations of “ball-tampering” – Jonny Wilkinson’s kicking mentor, Dave Alred, and the fitness specialist, Paul Stridgeon, were suspended after England’s 67‑3 victory against Romania when found to have illegally switched balls so Wilkinson could attempt conversions with his favourite. But this was a freakish occurrence.In cricket there have been arguments about balls for decades. On the 1976-77 tour of India, John Lever was accused of cheating by the India captain, Bishen Bedi, who believed Lever was applying Vaseline to the ball to enhance the shine and keep it swinging. The New Zealand players in 1990 admitted to using bottle tops to change the condition of the ball in Faisalabad Imran Khan once admitted he had used the same implement. Mike Atherton nearly lost his job as England captain after the “dirt in the pocket” affair in 1994 in 2018 Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft did lose theirs after the sandpaper incident in South Africa.Along the way, arguments over the condition of the ball caused Pakistan to refuse to take to the field in a Test at the Oval in 2006 and the game was abandoned, while Marcus Trescothick has happily acknowledged the assistance of Murray Mints to make the ball swing during the epic Ashes series of 2005. They aren’t all mad there is some logic here. Captains and bowlers are desperate to make that ball move in the air or off the pitch. Otherwise they are liable to spend an awfully long time in the field.Initially that movement was more likely to be achieved by picking the seam. This entailed using the thumbnail to raise the seam, which became so proud that it was far more likely to grip upon hitting the surface before, hopefully, changing direction. There were a few poachers who would become gamekeepers in that era. Ken Palmer, who played in the 1960s and umpired in the 80s and 90s, was renowned as a superb, one‑handed seam-picker.So, too, was Stuart Turner of Essex, known as “the Whistler” since you could hear the ball with its high seam fizzing towards you when he was bowling. In those days the umpires rarely examined the ball. Bowling just before lunch at Taunton I might spend my time urgently flattening the seam – since the umpires might just have a look at the ball during the interval.Reverse swing began in the 80s, though most of us did not realise it at the time. There was merely bewilderment that Sarfraz Nawaz of Pakistan and Northamptonshire could suddenly make a ball that was 60 overs old start to swing in to the right-handers. I remember being another confused victim, caught at bat-pad in a Test. Sarfraz helped to educate Imran and the next generation, which included the great Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The Aussies became aware of this phenomenon too but, like the English, they couldn’t quite explain it. Wasim and Waqar soon became the masters of reverse swing and they would educate their county colleagues at Lancashire and Surrey. The ball had to be handled delicately as if it was a precious diamond. One side would be polished, the other had to be bone dry and to acquire an almost dimpled effect. At one county captains’ meeting at Lord’s some “offending” balls were passed around. Mike Watkinson, the Lancashire captain, recognised one of the balls, blushed and quickly passed the box along. When Ian Greig, captain of Surrey and a more brazen character, had a look he immediately bellowed: “Oh yes, that’s one of ours.”Waqar and Wasim were magnificent sights in the early 1990s (I had retired by then) inflicting broken bails and toes in equal measure. Even the best were tormented. The image remains of Graeme Hick coming out to bat in the 1992 series: Waqar knew what he was going to bowl, Hick knew what Waqar was going to bowl, yet there was nothing the batsman could do about the perfect inswinging yorker. In time England caught up. In 2005 it was the ability of Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to make the ball reverse swing that began to spook Australia. Sometimes that movement is barely perceptible from a distance, but if the batsmen and bowlers think “it’s reversing” the balance of the game has changed.This is why there remains this seemingly preposterous debate about ball maintenance as the prospect of some Test cricket this summer grows. We have heard from the ICC about the relative risks of applying saliva and sweat. The Kookaburra ball-makers in Australia are experimenting with wax applicators to aid bowlers. And perhaps we will soon witness a resurgence of the use of Brylcreem, which was famously promoted by Denis Compton and Pakistan’s Fazal Mahmood in the 1950s. Anything to get the damn thing to move sideways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141b4d41a56f3c2e6e013f3ab26825975775af77/0_27_2168_1301/master/2168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1bf2b7ed4d1640f54df4366a16c5903","title":"liverpool v newcastle united premier league 1996 as it happened","story":"So did Liverpool deserve to win that? Yes. But then, so did Newcastle. It was just one of those games. Such entertainment, a tale told at a million miles an hour from the get-go. On this evidence, either team would be a worthy champion ... though knocking Manchester United off their perch may now be easier said than done. This amazing title race, however it pans out, is certain to stay with us for a mighty long time. Whatever happens next, we’re sure to love it. Love it. Thanks so much for reading this MBM! Nighty night!Here’s poor old Kevin Keegan, desperately trying to put a brave face on it. “Disappointed, but we lost nothing in defeat here today. Whatever they charge here, I don’t think people will be sending their tickets back saying they want a refund! A lot of energy and some great goals in a terrific atmosphere at a great stadium. It was a classic. It would have been much nicer to stand here talking about a 4-3 win, and it could so easily have been that result.” A word with victorious boss Roy Evans, who is dazed rather than ecstatic, having been put through the emotional mill. “It’s kamikaze football really. Great for the fans, but it could have killed me and Kevin off. It was great that both teams were so desperate for the win to stay in the championship race. It was great enjoyment for the fans, which is always important, and they were brilliant tonight. We’ve gone behind, we’ve gone ahead, they’ve lost it late on. It’s mad, isn’t it?”Liverpool’s victory keeps them on the fringes of the title race, five points behind leaders Manchester United in third. However that’s four defeats in six matches for Newcastle, who remain three points behind Alex Ferguson’s men but now with only one game in hand and an inferior goal difference. Whisper it around Anfield, but this has been a great night for Manchester United as well.The referee blows his whistle and the roof comes off Anfield! Keegan sportingly embraces Evans on the touchline before fleeing sadly down the tunnel. On the field, Collymore stretches his arms to the sky before catching James and then dropping him, Adams-Morrow style, thankfully without similar consequences. You’ll Never Walk Alone rings around the famous old stadium. You’ll never see another match quite as wild and wonderful.90 min +3: What a finish by Collymore. What an assist by Barnes. What contributions from Rush and Scales. Stanley Collymore’s name is pinging off the rafters of the Kop. Caught up in the moment, Collymore tries to make it five soon after the restart but, latching onto a Fowler pass rolled wide left, he takes a comical fresh-air swipe! How Newcastle wish he did that 60 seconds ago. Watson launches a hail Mary. Asprilla chases after it, but he’s adjudged to have bundled Ruddock to the ground from behind, and that’s surely that.90 min +2 still: As Collymore arcs off on a delirious sprint, Keegan slumps behind, and partially over, the advertising hoardings, head hung low, almost scraping the ground. Total devastation for Newcastle’s manager, though Carlsberg are getting good bang for their buck, because that’s going to be an image for the ages, especially if the Toon don’t win the title. Keegan eventually lifts his head up and flashes a rueful glance at his right-hand man Terry McDermott, who shakes his head sadly. The two Liverpool legends have had plenty to celebrate at Anfield over the years. Not tonight. This is going to hurt.Barnes flicks left to Rush, who flicks back to Barnes. Then another one-two, as the pair reach the edge of the area. Rush has four men around him as he completes the second exchange. Rush runs across Barnes and offers himself on the right. But Barnes – now surrounded by five Newcastle players – sorts his feet out, takes a crucial split second to think, opens his body and rolls an unexpected pass to the left, where Collymore is closing in! Collymore takes one touch with his right, then lashes into the bottom left from ten yards, Srnicek with no chance whatsoever!90 min +2: Ruddock finds Barnes to his left. Barnes sends the ball to Scales, out on the right. Scales drops a shoulder to leave Ferdinand behind and strides into space down the inside-right channel. He rolls forward and inside to Rush, who has his back to goal with Peacock behind him. Rush knocks a first-time lay off back to Barnes, who exchanges a crisp one-two with Scales to his right. Some momentum gathering. Suddenly Barnes and Rush are racing down the middle together, towards the Newcastle box!90 min +1 again: Watson bashes long, Asprilla gives chase. Redknapp nips in to powerfully head back to James. Hearts in Liverpool mouths there, because anything other than a firm connection would have sent Asprilla away, one on one. James rolls the ball out to Ruddock, deep on the right. And then ...90 min +1: McManaman dances down the right and wins a corner off Batty. Redknapp takes. Albert clears. McAteer bustles back down the right and nearly shins the ball out for a goal kick, but somehow manages to hook it into the mixer, just in time. Srnicek can’t catch, but does well to shovel the ball away from Fowler, rushing in at the near post.90 min: But Liverpool come straight back at Newcastle again, Barnes dictating play from deep, slipping a ball down the middle for Ruddock, who clips towards Redknapp, coming in from the left. Redknapp takes a touch to make space just outside the box, and for a split second he can see the white of Srnicek’s eyes. It’s a great chance, just to the left of the D, but he whistles his shot straight at the keeper, who parries. A foot either side, and that could have been it!89 min: Collymore backs himself in a footrace with Beardsley and wins a corner on the left. Redknapp takes. Ferdinand hooks clear.88 min: Asprilla taps the free kick right for Ferdinand, who creams a rising shot towards the top right. It would have beaten James all ends up had it been on target, but the ball nicked off Fowler, closing down, and flew high and wide. Newcastle don’t get the corner they’re owed.87 min again: This match has long been locked into a basketball rhythm, but now things are getting truly ridiculous. Newcastle go straight up the other end, Beresford rolling down the inside-left channel for Asprilla, who looks to spin into the box but is unceremoniously scythed by Ruddock, inches outside the area. A free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the goal.87 min: Ginola’s delivery isn’t up to standard. It’s hit deep, and Harkness heads clear. Rush flicks to McManaman, who swans away on the counter at great speed! He slips wide to McAteer, but the resulting cross is too close to Srnicek, who gathers. There were five red shirts to aim for there. Just about anywhere else, and Liverpool were snatching a late winner!86 min again: Scales barges into the back of Asprilla, out on the Newcastle left. A free kick and a chance for the visitors to load the box.86 min: Jones makes way for Rush. Collymore will move to the left wing, Liverpool’s all-time record goalscorer taking his rightful place in the centre.85 min: Ruddock’s back on. Anfield’s been a wild scene all evening, but everyone’s just that little bit quieter right now. And a lot more nervous. All four corners, both sets of fans, everyone on the benches, every last player. No exceptions. So much on the line. The tension is palpable.84 min: A brief pause - the first of the night, pretty much - as Ruddock goes over his ankle upon challenging Ferdinand for a high ball.83 min: Collymore romps down the inside right, nearly getting the better of Albert. He enters the box and manages to fire a shot across goal from an exceptionally ambitious angle, Albert recovering well by driving him as far wide as he could.82 min: Fowler dribbles down the inside left, reaches the box, and shoots. His effort pings off a backpedalling Howey. Before the set piece can be taken, Howey is replaced by Peacock, one centre back for another. Howey has tweaked his hamstring. Peacock is immediately in the thick of the action, barging Ruddock as the corner comes in. Only the Kop claim anything sinister has occurred.81 min: McManaman and Redknapp combine well down the right, the latter crossing in the hope of finding Fowler. But the ball flies behind the striker and Newcastle can clear.80 min: Barnes channels his 1987 QPR-baiting self by suddenly turning on the jets and gliding down the inside-right channel, dragging the ball past Lee and into the area. He lashes a shot towards the top left, but Srnicek sticks out a strong arm. Another fine save!79 min: What a missed opportunity this is! Albert launches long. It’s Ferdinand versus Harkness! Yes, as easy as that. Ferdinand spins the substitute defender with the greatest of ease on the edge of the box, takes a couple of touches to the left to take the defender out of the equation, and he’s one on one with James! With the match there for the taking, Ferdinand shoots straight at James, who made himself big, closed the angle, and sprawled bravely at his feet ... but despite all that should never have been allowed to make the save. That could be a huge miss in the context of the title race!78 min: McManaman probes down the right. He’s surrounded, and going nowhere, and plays a not particularly good ball down the channel, straight at Albert. But instead of intercepting and clearing, Albert allows the ball to clank off his boot, sending it towards a gap into which McManaman is only too happy to sprint. He’s clear in the box, albeit coming in at a tight angle. He could try to curl one past the out-rushing Srnicek, but decides to pull back for Fowler instead. Watson slices in to clear.77 min: The corner is a complete non-event. Newcastle break upfield, Ginola looking for Albert, of all people, down the left. James comes out quickly to intercept and send play back up the other end. Fowler teases Beresford down the right and wins another corner for Liverpool, their ninth of the evening. This one’s a waste of time as well ... and from it, Asprilla diddles Harkness out on the Newcastle right touchline with some astonishing ball-glued-to-boot intricacy, tiptoeing along on the tightrope as Harkness was sent off home for his tea. Asprilla is beyond livid as, scooting upfield into plenty of space, Liverpool are awarded a throw. That one didn’t go out either. The linesmen have been a bit flag-happy tonight. Newcastle are quite right to feel aggrieved.76 min: McManaman spins down the inside-right channel, away from Beresford in a flash. He whips infield for Fowler, who is waiting to slam home from six yards. Howey manages to slide in and deflect the ball away from the striker. He very nearly shanks it into the top-left corner of his own net, but he deserves the luck as it shaves the outside of the post and goes out for a corner. It was a last-ditch challenge he simply had no option but to make. Fine defending.75 min: Newcastle sportingly give the ball back to Liverpool from the throw, and Barnes is up and about again.74 min: Barnes goes down after a tussle with Lee, perhaps jarring a joint when stretching for a ball he was unlikely to reach. Play continues ... until an irritated Ruddock, in a highly energised manner, batters the ball high into the stand so Barnes can get some treatment.73 min: McAteer clips Ginola’s ankles. The Frenchman isn’t happy, springing up and going nose to nose, eyeball to eyeball, with the Liverpool man. The clash calms down quickly enough.72 min again: Newcastle break, Ginola caressing a pass down the left for Asprilla, who floats inside for Lee. Bursting towards the box, he chests down, with only Redknapp in attendance. If the ball flies straight forward, Lee will be clear on goal. But it squirts left, allowing Redknapp to step across and usher the ball back to James. Lee wants a free kick, but he’s never getting one.72 min: Ferdinand barges an in-flight Mcmanaman to the ground from behind. A garden-variety free kick, but Ferdinand’s frustration betrays him, and he flings the ball down with great passion and force. A no-brainer of a yellow card, in more ways than one. The resulting free kick goes nowhere.71 min: McAteer sends in another of those dangerous low curling crosses. Howey hacks clear under great pressure from Collymore, who it turns out was offside anyway.70 min: Redknapp scoops down the inside right with a view to releasing Fowler. Albert, the last man covering, does extremely well to hook away from danger.69 min again: McManaman outmuscles Beresford down the right and scampers free into the box. Continuing to dribble when he should be crossing, he nearly carelessly runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. He flicks it back infield just in time, but the linesman sticks his flag up, insisting the whole ball had gone out. It’s a dreadful decision, doubly so given that Beresford then slides in recklessly and takes both of McManaman’s feet away! That should have been a penalty, and the Kop certainly want one, though to be fair McManaman doesn’t make a song and dance about it.69 min: On the bench, Keegan has zipped his puffa-puffa jacket right up over his mouth. The look places emphasis on his pained eyes, peeking out over the top, dashing this way and that as he slumps back in his seat.Lee passes up the middle for Asprilla, but Ruddock intercepts and lays off to Redknapp. The ball’s shuttled wide right, via Mcmanaman, to McAteer. The wing back crosses early, curling a low outswinging ball around Beresford and along the corridor of uncertainty. A laboratory full of Nasa mathematicians couldn’t plot the path any better. The ball evades Albert, then Howey’s lunge, then finally Srnicek. Collymore, arriving at the far post, can’t miss. He flicks home, and takes receipt of Fowler, who leaps into his arms as the pair cavort in front of the Kop. Six goals, and all of them, in their own way, have been crackers! 67 min: But Newcastle come again, and Beresford, who hasn’t scored all season, nearly notches after a mazy dribble down the left channel. His eventual shot from the edge of the area is screwed across James and out for a goal kick.66 min: What a chance for Newcastle to go two clear! (Part XXXVIII in an ongoing series.) Asprilla, seemingly dribbling nowhere in midfield, facing his own goal, draws Ruddock and Scales, then flicks a ball between them, up the left flank for Ginola. Suddenly Newcastle are two on one, with only Harkness in the middle, and Ferdinand in yards of space. It’s a simple pass inside to set Ferdinand free, but Ginola overcooks it, sending the striker wide right. Danger over. Oh my.65 min: Ruddock sprays a Beckenbauerian ball down the left for Jones, who crosses for Fowler. The striker slips, and Newcastle clear. Barnes recycles, and Jones has more space down the left. This time his cross is met by Collymore, who heads harmlessly into Srnicek’s arms, pace and direction both lacking form a promising position.64 min: The Sky camera pans across the away end, settling on a cloth-capped gentleman who has become one of the icons of Newcastle’s bid for the title. Stevie Charlton, known to all simply as Old Stevie, has been following Newcastle home and away since 1927 ... coincidentally the year the Toon last won the league. He saw his first game as a five-year-old lad perched on his uncle’s shoulders in the Leazes End at St James’ Park. Newcastle, closing in on the title, beat Spurs 3-2. It’ll be some narrative arc, stretching 69 years, if this game ends with the same 3-2 scoreline and Newcastle go on to win title number five. Though if the worst should happen, at least he’s got to witness a Toon title win in his lifetime. Most of the rest of the fanbase can’t say the same.63 min: Fowler, to the right of the centre circle but facing the wrong way, plays a cute ball round the corner, sending McManaman tearing off down the inside right. He reaches the edge of the box but drags a lame shot towards the bottom left. Easy pickings for Srnicek.62 min: Ferdinand swans in from the left and finds Lee, who opens up his body with a view to curling towards the top right. He’s swarmed by red shirts. Liverpool go up the other end, Collymore driving down the left and nearly steaming past Watson, but the Newcastle man slides in to steal the ball just in time.60 min: McManaman and McAteer bustle down the right wing with great determination. McManaman tries to replicate Liverpool’s second by rolling the ball across the face of goal, but this time Fowler, to the right of the D, can only blast straight at Srnicek.59 min: But this isn’t so pretty: just after the restart, Batty loses his cool in a tussle with McAteer and swings an arm in the Liverpool man’s direction. Both players flap at each other, whereupon the red mist really comes down, Batty swivelling and swinging a right arm that would have taken McAteer’s head off had he made proper contact. That’s either a second yellow or a straight red. But McAteer doesn’t make a big deal of it, indeed he’s smiling as the referee has a quiet word with them both. All friends again. It’s probably the wrong decision ... and McAteer should have been booked as well ... but in the context of this gloriously unfolding match, artistically it’s the correct one. Let’s not do anything that’d spoil such a beautiful creation. Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?58 min: Such a delicious, elastic finish by Asprilla, who is some player. He bounds off towards the Toon Army, executing a spring-legged somersault nearly as aesthetically pleasing as his goal. The scores are in from the judges: 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0.Jones throws to Fowler, who is on the back foot and is immediately stripped of possession by Beardsley. The former Liverpool man dances in from the right. Barnes and Redknapp both think he’s going to pass back to his defenders, but as they charge up the pitch in anticipation, Beardsley plays a cute dinked reverse ball past them and towards Lee, running into the centre circle Liverpool have now totally vacated. Lee rolls a through ball between Ruddock and Harkness down the inside right. Asprilla is in acres, having been played onside by Scales in the middle! James comes racing out of his box to do ... well, what exactly? Asprilla, his mind made up for him, curl-whips a right-footed shot to the left of the flailing keeper, who desperately tries to deflect it away with a ing header. No chance! The ball bounces smoothly towards the empty net, Newcastle’s fans and their bench celebrating long before it completes its inevitable journey and crosses the line. Another peach of a goal!57 min: Redknapp has his eye in at the moment. Now he quarterbacks McManaman clear down the left. McManaman is through on goal, but Srnicek has read the danger brilliantly and races out of his box to head into touch before the Liverpool winger can take up possession, from which he’d surely have scored. Anfield is roaring. It’s surely only a matter of time before they score agai ... hold on! Scrub that! Because ...56 min: One throw, two passes, goal. Simple as that. Say what you will about Newcastle’s defence, and their bang-average away record, but there was nothing they could do to stop that. Liverpool simply sliced them open with panache. And they nearly do it again, straight from the restart, as Redknapp spots Collymore in space down the left and sends him off on the charge. He can’t quite dismiss Howey, who sticks to him like glue, and Srnicek is able to come out and smother.James bowls straight out to McAteer on the right touchline. He swishes a fine pass up the flank for McManaman, who dribbles hard at a frantically backtracking Albert. He reaches the corner of the box and rolls across the face of the area for Fowler, who barely breaks stride before viciously pinball-flippering an unstoppable left-foot shot into the bottom left! What a glorious pitch-length move, and a simple one at that. Fowler, caught in the moment as the Kop erupts and the night air crackles, es into the net and joyously heads the snagged ball. The sheer fun and exhilaration of that celebration! This team clearly enjoy their football, enjoy being young, enjoy life. They’re not half bad to watch, either.55 min: Fowler nearly sends Collymore away down the left with a pass from deep, but the flag goes up for offside. Watson was within range in any case. Newcastle, having weathered a little storm, breeze up the other end through Ginola, who gets past McAteer and Harkness down the inside left – too easily, one might argue – and shoots for the top right. Scales sticks out a leg and sends the ball gently looping into the arms of James. And then ...54 min: McManaman swings it in. Scales is free, eight yards out, and bashes a header goalwards. It’s not clear whether Srnicek will react, but it doesn’t really matter because Fowler, standing just in front of the keeper, tries to deflect the ball away from him with a gentle eyebrow. Had he judged it right, Srnicek had no chance, and the ball would be nestling in the top left. But he gets far too much on it, and effectively clears it off the line and out for a goal kick. Plenty of folk wearing red with hands on their heads.53 min: Fowler crosses from the right. Watson mishits his clearance. Redknapp sends it back with interest. Howey blocks the shot. This is mean pinball. Liverpool come back again, Barnes caressing one in from the left. Fowler traps the dropping ball and swishes past Watson in one move, but just as he’s about to pull the trigger, Albert sweeps it off his toe and out for a corner.52 min: Fowler beats Albert to a high ball and spins off down the right. But he’s flagged for accidentally slapping the Newcastle defender in the mushki mid-challenge. The crowd don’t like it ... but they’ll have to go along with it. The atmosphere inside Anfield is febrile.51 min: McManaman dribbles down the inside-left channel. He’s got such an elegant, deceptively languid style. He draws Batty towards him, then dismisses him with regal arrogance. He sashays past. It all happens at great speed, yet somehow he appears to be performing in slow motion. No wonder he’s so difficult to play against. He rolls a pass across the face of the box towards Collymore, who tees it up for himself before slicing wildly right of the target.50 min: Newcastle half-clear Redknapp’s corner. McManaman, to the left of the D, chests down and strokes a fine out-to-in curler towards the bottom left. Srnicek saves, spills and smothers. He did enough.49 min: Collymore slips McManaman clear down the inside left. He enters the box. There’s nobody in the middle bar Fowler. He whips a cross towards the near post. Or is it a shot?! Either way, it’s heading in. Srnicek is forced to turn the ball around the post for a corner.

Both the Nuffield Southampton and Southport theatres announced they were going into administration because of the impact Covid-19 had on revenues, while the Royal and Derngate in Northampton, Shakespeare’s Globe and the National Theatre in London have all sounded warnings about their futures.Last week, the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, told the  that his theatre was in a “seriously perilous” financial situation because of the Covid-19 crisis. Warchus said that the UK’s furlough scheme, which has been extended until October, was stopping the theatre from “falling to pieces” – but, because many theatres don’t expect to open until 2021 at the earliest, more help would be needed.“We are all puzzling away, thinking hard about how we can respond to this situation and what our creative input can be,” he said. “There are some bright people on those calls. We are mostly stumped because our hands are tied behind our backs: if you can’t bring performers and creatives together, with an audience, you’re incredibly limited.”The Lyceum announcement came on the same day Bectu, the union representing media and entertainment industries, released results of a survey which found theatre workers are concerned about being “forgotten” once lockdown measures are eased.Head of Bectu Philippa Childs said: “The extension of the furlough schemes is very welcome, but many people are still facing a massive cliff edge with huge uncertainty ahead of them. As long as social-distancing restrictions continue to be necessary, Bectu is acutely aware that the challenges for theatres to open again grow each day.“The industry is facing a potentially catastrophic impact from Covid-19, and government, employers and workers must come together to develop a strategy for our cultural sectors’ survival.”The Lyceum is consulting with unions and staff about possible redundancies, and will offer full refunds for customers who booked tickets for shows that have been cancelled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a3f1525c7fb4afed626ba7d248f37c8d1d2561/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dea8414452b8d821c6e56078f9cb388","title":"apple google phone app trace coronavirus","story":"Software can be used to develop apps that detect when a user has spent time near another user who later tests positive for the virusApple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.The companies had announced the unprecedented collaboration to leverage their technology to help trace and contain the spread of coronavirus last month, and say 22 countries and several US states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software.The software relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are omitting from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of Covid-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently. The software will be downloadable on most Androids and iPhone models released since September 2015.“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.The companies said the new technology – the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants – solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.The statement on Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, a Republican.Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said on Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps – his model, to help public health workers track where Covid-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

It tells the story of Jesse Dufton, a climber with a degenerative eye condition that has left him with almost no sight. Three years ago, he says, he thought he might have to give up “lead” climbing (for outsiders like me, that’s going up first) completely. But with the help of his fiancee Molly and his own determination, he set himself a challenge instead. He intends to become the first blind climber to lead on the Old Man of Hoy, a gorgeous, imposing 450ft seastack in Orkney.This is a film made by, and largely for, climbing enthusiasts, though it does the casual non-climbing viewer the courtesy of explaining everything that needs to be explained. Director Alastair Lee has made plenty of climbing films before and his wealth of experience shows. He is present in the story, because he has to be – to film a climb means being on the climb.However, the story is very much Dufton’s. He tells Lee that his vision has gone to such an extent that he cannot see his hand in front of his face unless he waves it around. This makes climbing a very different endeavour for him. He can’t see where he should be putting his hands or his feet, or his equipment, and has to use a combination of touch and verbal guidance from Molly. “I’m not really using my eyes, to be honest,” he says, which is all the more astonishing when the camera cuts away to the enormous drops beneath him. The intricacies of what it means to climb without sight and how that can be possible are truly fascinating. As Dufton spends so much time searching for holds by touch, it usually takes him three or four times as long as it might take a sighted climber. Other climbers talk about what he does with incredulity after attempting to boulder with a blindfold on, one even admits to Dufton that he’s wondering why he wants to do it at all. “You don’t get the satisfaction when there’s no chance of failure,” says Dufton, even though the failure in question is potentially very grave indeed.But this is a story of triumph. There’s little sentimentality here, only no-nonsense dedication to achieving what many would deem to be impossible. Dufton’s parents are a treat, giggling as they admit that they saw him bumping into things as a child: “We just thought, well, he’s not looking where he’s going.” When Molly tells the story of her partner’s proposal, on a mountaintop in Greenland, she says, simply: “Obviously I said yes.” Their relationship is a marvel to watch, whether she is describing a narrow grassy path, hanging perilously close to a sheer drop into the sea in order for him to navigate it, or offering encouragement as he twists his way up under a particularly awkward rock.There is so much action that there is little room for contemplation, but when it comes, it is touching. Dufton says he can remember Molly’s face as it was when they first met and he still had some of his sight. He says the one thing he would like back is the ability to see it again. There is some discussion about the possibility of him one day being able to see again, should scientific research get to that point, but there is also thoughtful discussion about what that would mean. Would being able to see make him a better climber, or is he a better climber because he has had to adapt to the resources and skills at his disposal?There are three “preparation climbs” as Dufton prepares to tackle the Old Man of Hoy. Each builds a nice sense of what is to come and it really is breathtaking to watch, as well as to enjoy the scenery that many of us will have been missing for the past three months. By the time we get to the climb itself, there is little doubt that Dufton will make it. This isn’t really about Free Solo levels of tension, nor is it particularly showy. It’s about tenacity and adaptation and hope. It has the feel of a charming, lo-fi sports film, but the human story at the centre of it is extraordinary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4b9368eeeb4c80c05a4e7b0b677091ac5d0a9b/244_86_2488_1493/master/2488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2355ba240faf9bd904197ecc2eb7083","title":"from fleabag to monkey dust the 20 best bbc three shows","story":"With rumours swirling that BBC Three may return as a broadcast channel, here’s a look at its greatest hits In a bid to attract the young viewers who have long since deserted it for Netflix, the BBC is toying with the idea of doubling the budget of BBC Three and bringing it back as a regular TV channel. To commemorate what could be one of the greatest comebacks in television history, here’s a look at the best ever BBC Three shows.A three-part Russell T Davies comedy drama based on the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, this was originally supposed to be a vehicle for Peter O’Toole. However, even O’Toole was blasted off the screen by the sheer electric crackle of David Tennant. This show is basically the reason Tennant became Doctor Who.A show from much simpler times, when people were content to watch docusoaps about relatively obnoxious bosses twonking about for the cameras while their beleaguered employees pull faces behind his back. This one was about a man named Nev who liked to sack people if they didn’t participate in his pre-shift company-wide singalong. Monstrous.A BBC Three mainstay, simply for its horrible premise. Each week a bride-to-be detailed the wedding of her dreams, then handed financial control of the ceremony over to her groom, who inevitably ruined everything so much that the bride burst into tears.A mockumentary about a pirate radio station operating out of Brentford, west London. What was most remarkable about People Just Do Nothing is how it took a niche sub-genre and turned it into a solidly classical sitcom. For a while, this was the new Only Fools and Horses.It’s hard to believe that The Mighty Boosh ran for such a comparatively short time, because its legacy is so strong. In the course of three years, the show introduced a brand of violently aggressive whimsy that almost singlehandedly created an entire comedy movement.More proof that BBC Three worked best as a comedy incubator. This was the channel that offered a chance to a nothingy little relationship sitcom by James Corden and Ruth Jones. It did well, then was promoted to BBC One. When it returned for a Christmas special in 2019, it was the most-watched scripted show of the entire year.Possibly the worst-titled show in the history of the channel – because, really, it had almost no bearing whatsoever on the content itself – Snog Marry Avoid was basically a programme in which people with distinct looks were “made under” to look like functioning members of society. It had a weird undertone of “conform or die”, but in a way that just made it more interesting.A politically angry prank show. Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubenstein attempted to expose societal hypocrisy by dressing up and infiltrating protests, or asking members of the public what they thought about issues. Perhaps a little heavy-handed in places but, when it worked, it was stunning.It’s hard to remember that Little Britain began on BBC Three, or how deliberately edgy it initially was. Before all the merchandise, playground catchphrases and kids’ books, Little Britain was a riot of nudity and blackface and suicide jokes. It would all do very badly now, but at the time it was a sensation.Exactly the sort of thing that BBC Three should have been producing from the online wilderness, Pls Like was a razor-sharp satire of influencer culture. Depressed, charisma-free host Liam Williams investigated various YouTube fads, only to discover that they were ultimately as empty as he was. Fantastic.Before embarking on his career as a director of elliptical arthouse films, Ben Wheatley made this sketch show. Just six episodes long, with a vaguely linked narrative, The Wrong Door was both incredibly funny, visually beautiful and spectacularly well cast. This is such an overlooked gem of a thing.Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye’s satirical animation was dark. Like, brutally dark. Suicide, bestiality, sexual degradation and terrorism were some of its regular targets. A girl returning her birthday presents so her dad could maintain his gambling addiction. A father killing himself because he could no longer identify with his children. Like I said, bleak. But funny, too. I promise. It did Four Lions before Chris Morris got there, too.There is a very good chance that we’ll look back and see This Country as the pinnacle of the mockumentary. A near-perfect look at rural village life, it’s both incredibly depressing and very silly. Kerry and Kurtan have no real means of escape from their surroundings, but they fill their time by focusing hard on nothing at all. The best episode is about an argument over who gets to use a certain shelf on an oven. It’s majestic.Although naturally more suited to comedy, BBC Three was also unafraid to find new dramatic voices. Perhaps its biggest success was Bodies, an unflinching drama about medical malpractice written by a former doctor named Jed Mercurio. This remains his best work, and I’m not only including it here for fear that he’ll have another Twitter tantrum if I don’t.Russell Tovey and Sarah Solemani in a sitcom – any sitcom – together would have been a recipe for success. But this wasn’t any sitcom, it was Stefan Golaszewski’s gorgeously observed and intermittently filthy delve into the nitty gritty of twentysomething relationships. Golaszewski most recently wrote Mum, and you can see the seeds of that show being sown here.If BBC Three does return to television, a lot of that will be down to the unstoppable international success of Fleabag. Everyone has already heard every possible opinion about the series, but it’s important to remember that its success was by no means guaranteed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge had already written one show (Channel 4’s Crashing) and it was basically mishandled to death. But Fleabag ended up with a channel that treated it with the care it deserved, and the rest is history.The last show developed by Monkey Dust’s Thompson before his death in 2005, Sharon Horgan’s Pulling was a sitcom about three single female friends and their generally disastrous attitudes towards life. Pulling was funny and filthy and unflinching, and BBC Three’s decision to cancel it just as it was hitting its stride is perhaps its greatest ever mistake.Unlike almost anything else Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer have done (with the possible exception of Channel 4’s The Weekenders), Catterick was a six-episode sitcom written by the pair. It’s ostensibly about a man who returns to his home town to reunite with his brother in search of his long-lost son, but it really just lays a canvas for Vic and Bob’s trademark silliness. To date, it remains their greatest work.It isn’t until you see a list like this that you realise exactly how dark comedy was in the middle of the 00s. And yet the darkest of all might have been Julia Davis’s Nighty Night, a sitcom about an opportunistic woman who uses her husband’s terminal illness as a chance to ascend the social ladder. It begins with her learning her husband’s diagnosis and uttering the line: “I mean, why me?”, then tears off into storylines that revolve around disability, torture, murder and paedophilia. But it was funny too, I promise.A few weeks ago I wrote a list of overlooked comedy shows that were currently available to stream. Top of my wishlist was Sean Lock’s 15 Storeys High, but I had to omit it on the basis that it wasn’t streamable anywhere. This is an outrage. Not only was 15 Storeys High – a sitcom about a grumpy misanthrope in a tower block – the best ever BBC Three show, but it should have set Lock on a more celebrated path than the panel show circuit he has found himself on. It’s simultaneously very quiet and uproariously funny. People sorely deserve to have 15 Storeys High in their lives again.Honourable mentions: I Believe in UFOs: Danny Dyer Becoming Human Sun, Sea and Suspicious Parents"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Officials have temporarily banned the sale of petrol in bulk, as well as firecrackers. Balloons for sporting events or other types of aerial advertising are also barred. Even more so than other years, it is critical that the parliamentary session – which coincides with the meeting of an advisory body, collectively known as “two sessions” – goes off without a hitch. The event, a time for China’s political elite to rubber-stamp policies and indicate new policy directions, was delayed for two months because of the coronavirus.In holding the two sessions, which begin on Thursday and Friday, Beijing is not only signalling its victory over the virus but is trying to emphasise control and leadership as it tries to move on from the pandemic. China is in unchartered territory of economic struggle and discontent at home and increased hostility from abroad, which makes the event especially important for its leader, Xi Jinping, who over the years has centralised power and embodies the government’s response to crises.Wu Qiang, a political scientist formerly, of Beijing’s Tsinghua University, said: “The two sessions is a very important stage for political performance. Even amid an epidemic, it must go on with everyone pretending that everything is normal. Xi, of course, hopes to consolidate his position through the two sessions by earning praise for his work countering the epidemic and showing a situation of stability.”US-China ties, already strained, have reached a new low, while other countries have joined calls for an independent investigation into the outbreak. Beijing also finds its diplomatic relations strained by growing support for its rival, Taiwan. In Hong Kong, anti-Beijing protests have resumed after a pause because of the coronavirus outbreak. Jessica Chen Weiss, associate professor of government at Cornell University, said: “The Chinese leadership faces a difficult challenge: to reset expectations and establish a new normal amid unprecedented domestic and international challenges.” At home, Xi faces the threat of public anger, which reached new heights at the worst of outbreak in Wuhan but has since largely disappeared from view. Observers say the party propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, praising the country’s win over the virus and emphasising the severity of the pandemic in other countries.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in February: “Only in China and only under the leadership of President Xi could there be such effective measures to put this sudden and fast-spreading epidemic under control.”The authorities appear to be clamping down further on criticism. Beijing police last month detained three people involved in saving censored content related to Covid-19 on the software development platform Github. A fourth citizen journalist, Zhang Zhan, who reported from Wuhan, has reportedly been detained in Shanghai. And Zhang Xuezhong, a constitutional scholar, was held after posting an open letter calling on the country’s parliament to push for political reforms.“One can imagine that the regime, facing a crisis, will adopt more methods of suppression,” said Wang Aizhong, an activist based in Guangzhou. Like many activists in China during sensitive political events, he has been visited by state security, which instructed him to stay quiet and ordered him not to travel to Beijing.Others say the two sessions, which state media have said will focus on issues such as climate change, GDP targets, poverty reduction and other reforms, barely disguise deeper problems of income inequality and lack of freedom of information and free speech, which critics say allowed the virus to spread.Wu said: “The basis of the Chinese model is that citizens sacrifice many kinds of rights and freedom for safety and wealth. In the past few months, Chinese people have started to doubt this. I have rarely seen such widespread suspicion of the government. For the first time in 20 years, freedom of speech has been linked to safety and security.”He added: “The two sessions will continue to praise the central government’s control over the virus, but it will only show the huge contractions of of Chinese society, where the widespread discontentment of regular people has no outlet.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus glance largest daily rise cases","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The World Health Organization issued a stark warning that the pandemic was far from over as 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide in 24 hours – the most in a single day so far.Speaking in Geneva, the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4.9 million people are known to have become infected since the outbreak began and at least 326,000 are known to have died.The figures, based on official tallies and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording systems and suspected undercounting.Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the country’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. He said seasonal hotels could reopen and direct international flights would resume during a televised address.Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries – including Afghanistan, where it has worked for 50 years – as the global aid organisation sees its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises during the pandemic.South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said. The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said.The US president said he is considering reviving a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier cancelling the gathering. While thousands per day continue to die globally, Donald Trump said the move would be a “great sign to all” and would represent “normalisation”.The South American nation confirmed that it had now identified more than 100,000 cases, making it the 12th country in the world to pass the milestone. The death toll in Peru, which has been under nationwide lockdown since March, rose to 3,024.The prospect of a second wave of infection across Europe is no longer merely theoretical, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control.“The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804ca6b4eaf24392bf689e1e9146edf1c916a915/0_168_5028_3017/master/5028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee20a0de84de378be215475a2949bba","title":"holidays within uk could return by july says minister","story":"Culture secretary Oliver Dowden says government has ambitious plans to revive tourism sectorHolidays within the UK could return as early as the beginning of July, the culture secretary has announced, saying that the government had ambitious plans to revive the tourism sector.Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, Oliver Dowden said any return of domestic holidays would have to be done cautiously, as reopening the industry only to close it again would be more damaging.“I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We’ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July,” he said.“Clearly, we can only do it if it’s safe to do so because I think the worse thing for our tourism sector would be to start, then see the R rate rise out of control, see a second peak that overwhelms the NHS that we then have to slam on the brakes again.“But, believe me, when we get to the point when we can have British tourism back, perhaps apart from the prime minister you won’t get a bigger champion of the great British break than me.”R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.His comments came after Patricia Yates, the acting chief executive of the official tourist agency VisitBritain, warned on Tuesday that the tourism sector expected to lose £37bn from the impact of Covid-19 – a figure that doesn’t factor in the effect of a possible 14-day quarantine for all visitors coming to Britain.A Downing Street spokesman said they were looking at a proposal by the body to add an extra bank holiday to the UK calendar this year, potentially around the school half-term holiday in October, in order to make up for lost earnings from the two May bank holidays spent in lockdown.Dowden also used the briefing to announce that the government planned to use £150m left in dormant bank and building society accounts to help prop up charities and social enterprises responding to the coronavirus crisis.“This funding will support organisations that are at the heart of their communities, building on our unprecedented package of financial support for the voluntary sector,” he said.“Through our proposals to further expand the dormant assets scheme, we want to unlock hundreds of millions more pounds for good causes, while keeping customer protection at the heart of the programme.”The money will be taken from accounts that have lain untouched for 15 years and for which no owner could be found, as part of the government’s dormant assets scheme. The initiative, which gives the proceeds from abandoned accounts to good causes, was launched in 2011. Thirty firms, including all major high street banks, have voluntarily transferred funds to the scheme.The £150m will include accelerating the release of £71m of new funds from dormant accounts alongside £79m that has already been unlocked and will be repurposed to help charities’ coronavirus response and recovery.The money adds to the £750m of extra funding for frontline charities announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in April, a sum described as insufficient to save some third-sector organisations from collapse.Some of the best-known national charities have warned they are in dire straits as revenue from charity shops and fundraising events dries up during the coronavirus lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec6fdf48adfcc70f48fe68232cfdc1881e1a1999/0_61_2666_1599/master/2666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0e8514a33a94ec06cba8d4e24beef2d7","title":"top eu doctor europe should brace itself for second wave of coronavirus","story":"Exclusive: ‘The question is how big,’ says Dr Andrea Ammon, who thinks March skiing breaks were pivotal to spreadThe prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments – including the UK – on disease control.“The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job title new to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment.And Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, speaks frankly in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began.Earlier this month the former hospital doctor, who worked through the various levels of healthcare bureaucracy to be become ECDC director in 2017, announced that, as of 2 May, Europe as a whole had passed the peak of infections. Only Poland was technically not yet there, she said.European governments have started easing their lockdown restrictions, some to the extent that bars and restaurants will soon reopen, others rather more tentatively. Boris Johnson has tweaked his message to Britons from “stay at home” to “stay alert” and is seeking to send pupils back into schools in a fortnight.Ammon’s job is to scrutinise the fallout and catch any rise in infections early. Talking through Skype from her kitchen at home, from where she has been working remotely for the last two months, she insists a disastrous second wave is not inevitable if people stick to the rules and keep their distance.But she detects an ominous weakening of the public’s resolve.“I think now it’s beginning to strain. What we see is that, on the one hand, the economic part for small and medium-sized businesses but also the experience of people not being able to exercise all the freedoms that we normally have: to go where we like, to be with whom we want to be. And this is a quite fundamental change to our normal way of life.Asked whether the data was showing any repercussions, Ammon gave a deadpan answer. “Not yet. I mean, maybe it doesn’t come ever, maybe all the adjustment of these measures is done in a prudent way. This is something we are really right now are closely monitoring: what is happening after all these measures.”As of Wednesday 158,134 people have died from Covid-19 in the EU and the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, according to ECDC data for the countries the agency monitors.The UK has the highest level of deaths in Europe, with 35,341, followed by Italy (32,169) and France (28,022).A total of 1,324,183 cases of infection have been reported. Among those is a member of Ammon’s own staff. Only a skeleton group of fewer than 10 now work in the agency’s office in Stockholm.“Part of our crisis team that needs to be there because they need very close cooperation. But they’re sitting wide apart. Honestly. We have to do what we preach.”Ammon recalls that it was only in late January that it had become clear that a novel virus causing a cluster of deaths in the Chinese city of Wuhan could be transmitted human to human, with initial concerns focusing on the possibility of the disease spreading through imports.As the extremely contagious nature of the virus emerged, the ECDC advised governments on 26 January to strengthen the capacities of their health services. There was fear of them being overwhelmed, as was shortly to be the case with tragic results in Lombardy in northern Italy.“We did really emphasise that these plans have to be updated. And in particular, the hospital preparedness needs to be looked at, how to make sure to have a surge capacity for beds, in general, but also in particular for intensive care unit beds.Ammon believes that when the inevitable inquiries look into the twists and turns of the crisis, the return of holidaymakers from Alpine skiing breaks in the first week of March will be seen as a pivotal moment in the spread of Covid-19 into Europe.Lockdowns followed – a theoretical possibility in the pandemic planning that few believed was feasible. “I remember when China put the lockdown to Wuhan, people told me, ‘Look this wouldn’t be possible in Europe.’ Hmm.”Now the lockdowns were straining the public’s tolerance, she said, but questioned whether they still came in too late and whether swifter action could have saved more lives. “I believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible, but … these measures are so stark, I mean they are so out of our experience that it, I think it needed … unfortunately the situation in northern Italy to make everybody clear that it is necessary.”Ammon now believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul. “I don’t know whether it’s forever but I don’t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans.”She is yet to book a summer holiday and warns those craving a break away to prepare for some disappointment. “What we are saying is that they should be prepared that even if there are some holidays and they go somewhere, it will not be comparable to what they had last year. At this stage we cannot say you can go out there, wash your hands and everything is fine. You have to keep your distance. These measures have to be in place.”But despite the privations of recent months, Ammon expresses little sympathy for the argument put forward by some, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption that merely shielding the elderly would have been sufficient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46dd3984907184a20e99216f9077b610f2c53c05/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b62523d6a0232b4b6773a659002001","title":"uk scientists must not be blamed coronavirus advice says royal society head","story":"Exclusive: intervention comes after minister appeared to scapegoat scientists over Covid-19 errorsScientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister appeared to blame “wrong” science for mistakes made in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, made the comments while being challenged on the government’s response to the crisis, including what was done – or not - to protect care homes. She told Sky News: “If the science was wrong, advice at the time was wrong, I’m not surprised if people will then think we then made a wrong decision.”No 10 swiftly distanced itself from her comments but they raised concerns that members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) were being hung out to dry.Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, said: “The one thing that should not happen is if scientists feel that by giving very frank advice, they’re somehow going to be penalised or blamed later. That will inhibit them from being very frank and you don’t want to inhibit frankness from scientists because you really want to know what is their best estimate of what’s going on at the moment …“I would say this is not a healthy debate to have, I think, scientists should stick to advice and then it is for government to accept the advice and decide what to do with it.”The Nobel prize-winning biochemist said the government was right to disassociate itself from Coffey’s comments.“This isn’t to mean that scientists are always going to get everything right, far from it,” he said. “They will have got things wrong but the beauty of science is that as new evidence comes in you change your understanding of it. And in the end the only way to progress out of this pandemic is through science.”When faced with criticism of its handling of the pandemic, the government has consistently responded with the refrain that it is “following the science”. Ramakrishnan said that while that was possible in some instances, with physical distancing for example, when evidence of the benefits were clear, it was not always so simple.“The science is complicated and putting it into policies also complicated and so you can’t just say you’re following the science in every case,” he said. “I think what ministers should say is, ‘we’re heeding the science, we’re heeding the science advice, we’re considering it when we make our decisions’ – that would be a more honest thing.”A member of Sage, who did not want to be named, also stressed that decisions were ultimately the responsibility of ministers.“Politicians are in charge, and they decide what advice they get,” they said. “Scientists like me are invited to give advice and have no power to enact any decisions. They don’t have to accept the advice, and indeed should take a wider view than the science when making decisions – they are elected by the population to take decisions on our behalf.”He told the : “Science just isn’t like that and so the idea that they were following the science was wrong. And now that they’ve been criticised for their steps they have taken, it is bizarre that they’ve tried to say that it was wrong science that led them astray rather than their own decisions.”Stevens said that, during his time advising the government on drugs policy, he had seen civil servants “tell ministers the story they want to be told”. He highlighted comments by Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises Sage on infectious modelling, saying they did not carry out detailed modelling for a lockdown originally “because it didn’t seem to be on the agenda”, as “politics leading the science rather than the other way around”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b33e85dd42fdaab6762649b7005ab117356eb6/0_215_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a4251bbf2ac5b8b5bea999a814ffea46","title":"could be a bit strange new zealand bars to reopen but fun is kept at arms length","story":"No live music, no bar, table service only, and a ‘visible’ police presence but excitement bubbles at the chance for a night outDancing, hook-ups and bar banter will be off the menu as New Zealand’s pubs and bars reopen on Thursday night, with some saying the social distancing requirements will make for a “sad and strange” atmosphere in the nation’s party hotspots.Last week, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved the country from coronavirus lockdown level 3 to level 2, meaning most shops and restaurants could reopen, as well as schools, workplaces and public amenities.However, on advice from the Ministry of Health, bars and nightclubs remained closed for an additional week, because people’s close proximity meant they were deemed particularly high risk. One of the country’s largest outbreaks was spread at a St Patrick’s Day gathering at a Matamata pub in the North Island.On Thursday night, pubs may finally open their doors but for some, capacity will be more than halved because customers must remain seated at socially distanced tables and be waited on by a dedicated server: the social “bar” of a bar is off-limits and no one is allowed to mingle with other tables – though shouting across the room will be permitted, some bar managers said.Rogue and Vagabound in central Wellington is known for its live music and raucous dancefloor. The bar’s capacity will be reduced from 150 to 80 patrons, and live music and dancing – unless you are standing up at your own table – will not be permitted.Its general manager, Lara Denby, said she was expecting a busy night, and most of the tables had been pre-booked by regulars used to mixing and mingling.“We’re a fast-paced bar, it’s usually pint after pint after pint over the bar, so the pace will feel much slower, but it might be nice, we could get a chance to slow down and talk with our customers more,” she said.“People are really excited to be coming out, but it could be a bit sad and strange. Our customer base is very connected with each other, but it will have to be that gentle reminder, that you can’t do that in ‘the new normal’. Just stand in place at your table and have a dance on your own if you want … so strange.”Down in Dunedin the capacity at the Craic bar in the Octagon has been slashed from 100 to a maximum of 40 people. A popular spot for dancing, manager Bruce Hoffman said he was expecting a quiet night with such reduced capacity and his staff would be policing the toilets in addition to the bar for any unauthorised mingling.“It’s going to really change the atmosphere, we usually have live music and we can’t have that now because it would encourage people to dance and get too close,” Hoffman said.“I think the vibe will be quiet, more like a lounge bar. I think people are quite desperate to get out for a beer again, it gets boring at home. But you can’t mingle with any other tables, though I guess we’ll allow people to talk to other tables from afar.”With the new enforcements in place, many smaller, cocktail-style bars have said it was not economical to open their doors during level 2, and venues usually patronised exclusively for dancing such as clubs have also said they intend to stay closed until level 1, as a nightclub with no mingling allowed would defeat the purpose.A police spokesperson said they were aware people were excited about bars reopening and that officers would be maintaining a “visible presence” in party hotspots.“We understand people are keen to socialise and visit their favourite establishments, however, restrictions remain in place and safety is the number one priority,” the spokesperson said. “Officers will maintain a visible presence in our communities and continue with reassurance patrols around licensed premises”“Most New Zealanders are doing the right thing and acting responsibly. Let’s keep it up so we don’t risk the gains we’ve made to date.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258635.1590015720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students must opt in to receive calculated grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new calculated grades system is being set up following the cancellation of Leaving Cert exams on public health grounds due to Covid-19. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillLeaving Cert students will not automatically receive calculated grades but will have to to opt-in for them under a new online system being set up to manage the cancellation of exams.Students will also have the opportunity to re-nominate their subject levels - such as higher, ordinary and foundation - at which they wish to receive their calculated grades, according to well-placed sources.Online training is due to be provided to teachers regarding the new\u0026nbspprocess over the coming days, along with detailed written guidance from the Department of Education.These steps are expected to be outlined in official guidance for use of calculated grades to be issued to schools and teachers tomorrow.Teachers’ unions have expressed their disappointment to the department that these arrangements are not in place yet given that the academic year is finished at the end of May.Under the terms of their contracts, however, teachers are required to be available for non-teaching work in schools beyond this point,\u0026nbspwhere necessary.Following the Government\u0027s decision earlier this month to cancel the summer Leaving Cert exams, more than 60,000 students are set to receive calculated grades for the first time based on teachers’ estimates.Under this approach, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank over for their class.The guidance will state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.Marking systemIn order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to per centages.These grades will then be sent to the Department of Education where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.Sources also said that teachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.In cases where students who are studying a subject outside a recognised school, Mr McHugh has signalled that these students will be examined on a case-by-case basis.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, many of whom are studying in an alternative setting such as a private college.For students in receipt of home tuition with an association to a recognised school, the guidance will provide information for school authorities to engage with the home tutor in arriving at a decision.Whether a valid estimate of performance can be provided will depend on whether the home tutor is a registered teacher and where the school is satisfied with the evidence used to support the judgment.In cases where a student has moved school recently and the length of time is such that the teacher considers that they do not have enough evidence to make a sound judgement, the guidance will state that the teacher should consult school management about acquiring additional information from the student’s previous school."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Strong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis findsReducing use of fertiliser and antibiotics also on agenda in bid to safeguard environment"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Alan BetsonThe HSE told the nursing homes regulator last month, as coronavirus outbreaks rose sharply, that it could not supply three days’ worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) to all nursing homes, as requested, due to shortages. The Health Information and Quality Authority’s chief inspector Mary Dunnion escalated concerns about reported shortages of PPE within nursing homes and congregated disability centres last month to the highest ranking official with the HSE.Ms Dunnion wrote to HSE chief executive Paul Reid on April 8th seeking widespread distribution of PPE to nursing homes ahead of further outbreaks. DeathsThe request came more than a week after Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents private nursing homes operators, sought three days’ worth of PPE for nursing homes in a meeting with the Minister for Health Simon Harris. The nursing home sector has borne the brunt of the pandemic, accounting for 54 per cent of the deaths from coronavirus in the State.By the peak of the crisis in the first half of April, nursing homes were experiencing difficulties accessing sufficient PPE. On April 8th, there were virus clusters – each defined as two cases or more – at 164 residential care facilities, including 117 nursing homes, an increase from 53 a week earlier. Ms Dunnion asked Mr Reid in her letter that “in the interest of resident and staff protection” and “prior to a Covid-19 outbreak being declared” that a “baseline supply” of appropriate PPE “be made available as a priority within all nursing homes and congregated disability centres”.“While the national supply of PPE remains a concern, I request that a baseline supply should consider the projected consumption rate relative to the number of residents in the centre and be sufficient to last three days,” she told Mr Reid in her letter. The correspondence was copied to senior health officials: HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor HSE national director of community operations David Walsh the HSE’s national director of quality assurance and verification ision, Patrick Lynch Dr Kathleen MacLellan, assistant secretary for social care at the Department of Health and Hiqa chief executive Phelim Quinn. Ms Dunnion sought PPE for nursing homes not yet affected by outbreaks comprising long-sleeved, fluid-repellent disposable gowns, non-sterile examination gloves, surgical masks and “FFP2” and “FFP3” medical grade masks for aerosol-generating procedures.The letter was released by Hiqa to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. Under reviewThe HSE told Hiqa in a response on April 14th that due to difficulties in sourcing PPE that it would not be possible to provide the three-day baseline supply. PPE was being directed at the areas of greatest risk through a co-ordinated distribution management system for the delivery of the equipment, the HSE said.In the HSE’s reply, Patrick Lynch, national director of quality assurance, told Hiqa that Ms Dunnion’s requested supply of PPE would be kept under review as the supplies of PPE built up.By April 14th, the date of the HSE’s response, the number of clusters in residential care facilities had risen to 221, including 158 nursing homes, a further 41 nursing homes in six days. A spokeswoman for the HSE said last night that in the early days of the response to Covid-19 it “faced an unprecedented challenge in the face of global demand for PPE.”The HSE’s success in sourcing significant quantities from China and domestically has meant “the supply situation has improved significantly over the past four weeks in particular,” she said.Each crisis management team across the HSE’s community healthcare area is “prioritising the needs of long-term care residents” and has “offered very significant support to the nursing homes in their areas, particularly those with Covid-19 outbreaks,” said the spokeswoman. Between April 17th and May 14th some 12.6 million items of PPE - or 39 per cent of all PPE distributed across the health service - went to the long-term residential care sector, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hiqa chief inspector sought \u0026lsquopriority\u0026rsquo supply for homes from HSE chief on April 8thCatholic Church teachings will have \u0026lsquono authority \u0026rsquo at Elm Park, says canon lawyerOver a third of recipients were paid less than \u0026euro300 a week before payment was introducedWatchdog report criticises University of Limerick and South Southwest hospital groupsHSE working on new plan for when it will be safe to resume routine screeningThe prolonged, close proximity of workers increases the risk of spreading the virusWatchdog warns Limerick and South Southwest groups face \u0026lsquosignificant\u0026rsquo risksThe way we live now helps infectious diseases spill over from wild animals to humansGovernment sources privately fear the North set to become Brexit battleground againCandidates will have the option to re-nominate subject levels through online systemStrong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis findsChildren had to come to live with their father in Kildare after their mother died in the PhilippinesTwo metre social distancing rule may prevent hotels reopening, says taskforce memberGusts of up to 110kmh expected in Galway and Mayo on Thursday and FridayLegal action relates to birth St Munchin\u0026rsquos Regional Maternity Hospital in LimerickPandemic payment would \u0026lsquoabsolutely\u0026rsquo be extended, decision due \u0026lsquoin coming weeks\u0026rsquoComments dampen call from National Parents\u0026rsquo Council Primary for partial June reopeningGarda\u0026iacute appeal for help from public after Alan Hall (45) found dead at west Dublin propertyGarda appeal for information on incident in Seagrange Park, Baldoyle on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258611.1590006310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there is no social distancing reopening of forty foot gets off to rocky start","story":"Sunbathers and swimmers enjoy the sun, the sea and the fresh air at the Forty Foot and Sandycove, Dublin, on Wednesday afternoon.  Popular amenities are, however, still subject to strict social distancing guidelines.

Photograph: Alan BetsonFor a couple of shimmering, sun-kissed minutes at lunchtime on a warm May day in Sandycove it seemed almost as if everything was okay again. Children in swimsuits played by the water’s edge, oblivious to the cold as parents decanted picnics onto rugs and bellowed at their offspring to mind themselves.Then an older couple emerged together from the freezing, snot green sea and before they so much as draped a towel around their goose pimpled bodies, they had put their surgical face masks on.This was no normal day at the beach and the couple coming out of the water were acutely aware of it.“There is no social distancing being observed at all, I can tell you that,” said Robert McQuillan. He described himself as a year-round swimmer and since the lockdown he and his wife Jane have been swimming closer to their Killiney home.BlameBut because the sea there was rough on this day, and because Sandycove had just re-opened to the public, they decided to venture a little farther afield.As he spoke Mrs McQuillan nodded in agreement.“It is more kids than anything, they are running all over the place. People are supposed to be coming here to swim before leaving. They’re not though. You can’t blame the children, they are just doing what comes naturally. But as an adult you would want to be deaf, dumb and blind not to know the rules at this stage.”A man who identified himself only as David stood at the water’s edge and prepared to e in to the water. “I was here yesterday evening and decided to come back again today,” he said.He declined to give his full name because, he said, he lived farther than 5km from the beach he was standing on. His home was 14km away, in fact. He called out to his girlfriend, instead, to see if she would talk to The .“I can’t be identified either,” she said. “My boss thinks I am at work.” Then they jumped into the sea together.‘Cooped up’Nearby three people sat side by side, separated by the required two metres – or close enough to it.“I swim every day,” Martin Archbold said. “But it looks a bit overcrowded and my concern is that that this is a trial and if the crowds come they will simply close the place again. People are supposed to be here to swim and they go.”His swimming buddy Michael Forde nodded. “I haven’t even got in yet. It is too packed here, it is crazy, this is not what it should be. Mind you, you can understand why people want to be here because they have all been cooped up at home for weeks.” Then he went off for a walk having decided to give the swim a skip for now.Around the corner from the small stretch of sand, is the Forty Foot. Signs billowing in the wind on the approach reminded people of the need to socially distance and to “swim and go”. The 40 or so teenagers sitting around clearly didn’t see the signs or if they did, they had taken the decision to ignore them. They weren’t too gone on social distancing either.They sat huddled together in distinct tribes. Some were drinking cans of lager, others were listening to Michael Jackson on a boombox, partying like it was 1979.Maria Quintilla, another hardy swimmer, looked at the large group with disapproval in her eyes. “I am actually afraid of the sea,” she said. “But it is important to fight your fears. It helps you build confidence and the sea water is really good for the immune system.”While she was concerned about the influx of young people, she was more relaxed about the families gathered nearby. “I think people have been very respectful and keeping their distance.”She started a conversation with a group of fellow swimmers.“I have called the guards,” one said. Then they all looked out over the water towards Dollymount across the bay.Back at the entrance to the Forty Foot, a man in loud shorts emblazoned with a popular cola brand swigged deeply from a glass bottle of cider and sauntered over to where his friends were relaxing in the sun.Minutes later two squad cars arrived at the scene. Two gardaí climbed out of one and strolled along the little beach asking people where they lived and reminding them of the need to move on. The other gardaí approached the group of younger people at the Forty Foot changing area and asked where they were from. “Blackrock, ” said a boy from Clondalkin.If the gardaí didn’t believe him they didn’t let on. It was all pretty relaxed and within minutes the groups in both sections had largely dispersed leaving it to the swimmers and the seals. The wind was picking up by then anyway.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258512.1590001175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish climate change policies should turn on science not politics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFriends of the Earth said the poll results indicate a desire for ‘faster and fairer climate action at the heart of everything a new government does’. File photograph: GettyA poll on the extent of public support for climate action that might be undertaken under a new programme for government indicates strong backing for increased ambition in addressing carbon emissions.Despite difficult economic times ahead, almost two-thirds of adults in Ireland believe it remains important that the incoming government prioritises climate change.The poll of 1,021 adults was conducted by Opinions Market Research between May 12th to May 18th for the environmental group Friends of the Earth.Some 90 per cent of respondents believe Irish climate-change policies should be guided by science rather than politics – as was the case with Covid-19. There is large support (92 per cent) for government initiatives to support jobs by encouraging the improvement of a home’s energy efficiency. Some three out of four citizens believe investment in transport should favour safe walking, cycling and public transport ahead of private vehicles this support is at 80 per cent in Dublin and at 72 per cent in rural Ireland.Almost three in four people polled agreed carbon emission reductions should be pursued to ensure more sustainability in farming. Support for this action was reflected across all regions. In Dublin, the figure was 79 per cent for in the rest of Leinster it was 72 per cent in Munster 70 per cent and Connacht-Ulster 68 per cent.What was the extent of opposition?Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said he believed the scale of public support for serious climate action indicated the poll was overwhelming. “We hope the results will give all three parties negotiating a programme for government the confidence to put faster and fairer climate action at the heart of everything a new government does,” he said.“We simply can’t afford to waste another five years dabbling at the edges of climate action. This poll shows that across all parts of Irish society, regardless of age, gender, class or urbanrural, there is a large majority in favour of stronger action to reduce pollution from transport, buildings and farming,” he added.Seven in 10 Irish citizens feel “very strongly” that a failure to act on climate change is a failure to act in the best interests of the people of Ireland. This view is held most strongly among those aged under 35, with 76 per cent agreement within that cohort. Only 23 per cent of respondents either “disagree strongly” or “disagree somewhat”.

Photograph:  Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireA significant minority of people in receipt of the €350 pandemic unemployment payment were paid less than €300 a week before the payment was introduced, a Government report has said, as questions continue about the future of the payment.The report, compiled by the Department of Business, raises concerns about “significant disincentive effects associated with the pandemic unemployment payment with 38 per cent of recipients previously earning less than €300 per week”.With almost 600,000 people receiving the special payment, it means that over 200,000 people are better off unemployed than they were while working. That number includes many people who were working part-time in the hospitality industry.Although there are growing worries in Government about the sustainability of the payment, Ministers are likely to extend the special payment over summer, declining to either signal a firm end date or to close the scheme, according to sources familiar with the discussions on the topic.Yesterday, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments if these were to be maintained at the current rates until the end of the year.At present people who were unemployed prior to the current coronavirus crisis receive jobseekers’ benefit of €203 per week. However those who lost their jobs on foot of Covid-19 receive a special pandemic unemployment payment of €350 per week.There is a general belief among Ministers that the €350 a week payment cannot continue indefinitely. But there is no consensus on how to bring it to an end.Yesterday, Mr Donohoe said if the Government was to continue paying the special Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment at the current levels until the end of the year as had been suggested, it would then face “an understandable issue” in which citizens who were unemployed prior to the current crisis would ask why their jobseeker benefits were so much lower.Mr Donohoe’s forecast of demands for unemployment benefit equality came as the Government faced calls to extend the separate special weekly € 350 payment for those with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection to cancer patients who were cocooning.The Irish Cancer Society said on Wednesday cocooning cancer patients “must have fair access to pandemic illness payments so they do not feel forced to risk an unsafe return to work”.The group said it was unfair that cancer patients who were unable to return to work because they are cocooning could not access the payment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258412.1589992236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in uganda radio brings together couples separated by coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInside the offices of Radio King 90.2FM in Gulu, northern Uganda, where presenter Okeng Isaac Jans dedicates segments of his show to connect loved ones. Photograph: Sally HaydenA radio station in northern Uganda has been reuniting people separated by the country’s coronavirus-related travel ban, which split families, lovers and friends when it came into effect in March, with just one hour’s notice.In the first two weeks of the lockdown this was a daily segment, explains Okeng Isaac Jans, a 28-year-old who presents the breakfast show six hours a day, five days a week.“It is mostly friends, people who are dating, school friends, workmates locked in different towns. People are trying to connect with loved ones and see how they are,” says Jans. While data is relatively cheap, some rural areas don’t have internet connection, and phone calls are expensive.Now, the segment goes out on Wednesdays and Fridays.Conflict“It’s become more complicated to connect people as the lockdown goes on, not least because many have lost their routines,” Jans says. “People are doing a lot of sleeping these days.”Radio King 90.2 FM was set up in 2004, when conflict was still raging across northern Uganda. The medium has been used effectively before to send messages encouraging rebel fighters to give up arms and return to their homes. Specially-written songs were played confirming there was an amnesty, and that insurgents would be safe and welcome if they came back.Since the pandemic began, the country’s musicians have released an array of coronavirus-related songs, which have been broadcast across more than 200 radio stations. The most ubiquitous was penned by opposition leader and pop star Robert Kyagulanyi, who goes by the name Bobi Wine, and sings that it’s necessary to “sensitise the masses to sanitise” in his song ‘Coronavirus Alert.In a studio in Gulu city, Jans sits between red and white soundproofed walls, a thickly carpeted floor beneath his feet. He plays music from Ugandan girl group The Obsessions, Caribbean band Kassav’, and Whitney Houston, while regularly reminding people to “stay safe and wash your hands”.In one of his segments connecting people who were split, a man called Alvin phones up, asking to be put through to his “colleague” Sefa, “the future wife of mine”.Crackling lines“Who is Alvin to you?” Jans asks Sefa, when she answers after several rings.“He’s my boyfriend,” Sefa responds, shyly.“He asked us to call you and tell you he loves you so very much, no matter the distance,” Jans says.On air, their lines crackling, Alvin thanks Sefa for everything she’s done for him. “You never go astray, you’ve been there for me,” he says.“Not that much,” she responds.“It’s a lot,” Alvin says, adding: “I promise to keep the promise to you.”Jans, in his booming radio voice, thanks them. “You’ve been a very wonderful couple. We’re going for a wedding very soon after corona, right?” he asks.“Give us one more year,” says Alvin, who then requests Us Against the World by Westlife.“I believe you’re going to love and stay loyal to each other during this lockdown and hopefully the time comes when you can meet again,” says Jans, before signing off. “Remember, we can do this.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Cyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownLeader missed out on a seat as the venue was too full under Covid-19 restrictionsSecond most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism was taken into custody when he was sixAid groups warn a humanitarian disaster looms in camps housing one million peopleBusinesses wrestle with capacity issues and lockdown debts as restrictions easeAttacks this week, including on maternity unit in Kabul, leave process hanging by threadAustralian arm of Genesis II group who wrote to Donald Trump fined $150,000City where pandemic began have reported first infections since lockdown was liftedChengdu Letter: History is repeating itself as Chinese officials threaten bereaved against legal actionRiot police intervene as renewed concern over Chinese power revives movementDean of hospital in Mumbai blamed families for not collecting the bodies of loved onesSouth Korean officials attribute new outbreak to one person who visited several barsBreaches of city-state\u0026rsquos strict lockdown rules can result in hefty fines and even jailDestruction increased 64 per cent in April, compared with the same month a year agoAuthorities double evacuation area around factory after about 800 people hospitalisedLockdown sees tens of thousands walking home after being laid off in large citiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258614.1590020524!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national mythologising has impeded coronavirus response in europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA sign advising visitors to social distance at a shopping centre in Stockholm, Sweden. Photograph: by Henrik MontgomeryAFP via GettyIn the late 1700s readers of novels in the English language were gripped by a series of suspenseful tales set in Italy. \u0026nbspThey were typically set in crumbling castles and featured heroines persecuted and pursued by devious Italian nobles. Their setting in a Catholic land, against a backdrop of warrenous monasteries and casts of cloistered nuns and sinner priests, lent them an exotic and sinister atmosphere that enthralled readers, and created the genre of Gothic fiction.The author of these 18th century best-sellers – A Sicilian Romance, The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Italian – was a housewife living in London.Ann Radcliffe had never been to Italy. The place she wrote about existed only in her imagination. But her idea of Italy – decadent, thrilling and threatening – was convincing to readers as a place where their wildest fears and fantasies could play out.Sweden appears to play a similar role in the popular imagination of 2020.\u0026nbspBefore the pandemic, the Scandinavian country was an obsession of the international anti-immigration right. Gritty urban tales from Malmo and Stockholm were mined as content for right-wing websites and social media networks around the world.\u0026nbspFlorid stories about Sweden featuring violence and sexual assault – and sometimes bacon – became a genre of their own. Whole concepts, such as the idea of “no-go zones”, in which immigrants are supposed to have taken control to the exclusion of national police forces, became common parlance, despite the concept not being recognised within Sweden itself.\u0026nbspSweden became the setting for a kind of morality tale about immigration, and what happens to liberal western countries that succumb to its dastardly effects.In a strange reversal, Sweden’s response to the coronavirus made it the focus of envy.\u0026nbspThe country did not close schools and businesses to curb the spread of the virus. This led to Sweden being adopted internationally as the darling of lockdown opponents. Peculiarly, people of a laissez-faire and pro-business persuasion took up the Scandinavian welfare state as a bastion of personal freedom and sound economic policy.They saw in Sweden what they wished to see: an argument that society could continue as they knew it, and that their behaviour did not need to change. They used it to argue against lockdown policies as unnecessary, and to shift the blame for economic turmoil on to the policy response to the disease, and away from the pandemic itself.Economic downturnIn recent days the Financial Times, Bloomberg, Politico, the Wall Street Journal and numerous others have reported that Sweden is facing a comparable economic downturn to the rest of Europe despite its lighter pandemic restrictions. Its central bank forecasts a downturn of 7-10 per cent and unemployment as high as 10.4 per cent.But this narrative would make sense only to a non-Swedish audience.\u0026nbspWithin Sweden, the national pandemic policy was never justified with an economic rationale. It was designed by the country’s public health agency, which has no role in setting economic policy. The idea of it as an inidualistic, pro-business policy was a creation of foreigners drastically misreading Sweden from abroad.Authorities in Sweden actually argued that top-down measures such as closing businesses and schools were not necessary because Swedes could be relied on to do what they were told. To follow the government’s advice. To work from home if possible, to wash their hands frequently, to stay distant from others, to not form crowds.“They’re not wedded to this idea of personal freedom,” said Philip O’Connor, an Irish journalist based in Stockholm. “Inidual responsibility means obeying the state.”No clear morality tales can yet be told about the approach of one country to the pandemic versus another.But national mythologising has been pervasive, both towards other countries, and in conjuring up calming stories about why one’s own citizens need not be alarmed.‘Disciplined’ DutchEarly in the pandemic, it was common to read in Dutch media that the Netherlands was too sensible to be badly affected by the virus. The fate of Italy would not befall the Netherlands, philosopher Marli Huijer told an interviewer in March, because the Dutch are “disciplined citizens” who “often wash their hands”.This kind of exceptionalism was also notable in the United Kingdom, where evocations of the defiant spirit of the Blitz were ubiquitous despite being irrelevant, and in the context of an indifferent infectious virus, perhaps actively harmful.Ideas about national character also impeded the learning of lessons where they were available. The experiences of Asian countries, from Hong Kong to Taiwan, were largely ignored, despite the fact that the people there had already fought this virus and in many cases prevailed.Instead of enjoying the fruits of their learning, western countries insisted on wastefully reinventing the wheel, apparently convinced that whatever was needed here, it could not possibly be the same as what had already worked so far away, in those places imagined to be so very different.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"PA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineDecree expected to spare lives of at least six men accused of taking part in Arab SpringCountry to be ided into colour-coded regions based on infection and death ratesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc focus brexit voting towns overhaul local news","story":"The BBC is to refocus its news programmes on towns and cities that voted Leave, after admitting it “under-served” them during the EU referendum.The corporation will overhaul its regional news output and give more time to voices from the Midlands and the North of England, answering critics who have accused it of representing a metropolitan elite.In its annual plan, the BBC singled out Bradford, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Peterborough. Bradford voted 54.2 per cent to leave the EU and the others voted at least 60 per cent in favour.The move comes two months after the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the BBC had failed to understand the strength of pro-Brexit feeling and had provided a “narrow urban outlook” in its news reporting.John Humphrys, the former presenter of Radio 4’s Today programme, has said the referendum result took the BBC by surprise because the corporation was so out of touch with ordinary people.The plan states: “We need to build around a definition of ‘local’ determined by audience need and by a focus on an audience that is less well served by the BBC’s current network portfolio.“This is likely to involve a greater emphasis on serving audiences in the Midlands and North of England better, including focusing on areas the BBC has traditionally served less well, such as Bradford, Sunderland, Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Peterborough.”The change of approach is part of wider changes in the BBC’s local news services in England, which are to undergo a “profound transformation” amid budget cuts.“Our current local strategy in England was effectively created in the 1960s and 1970s when local radio and regional TV transmitters set the pattern for how the BBC thinks about local and regional audiences and editorial output. But while little has changed in the BBC’s editorial offer or geographical targeting, audiences have changed,” it said.Elsewhere in the plan, it was confirmed that BBC Four is to be downgraded to a repeats channel, with original arts programming and documentaries being squeezed into BBC Two.BBC Four could also become the first BBC channel available to foreign audiences, with plans under way to turn it into a subscription channel outside the UK as the corporation looks for new ways to generate commercial income.BBC Four is to become a repeats channel which viewers outside the UK can pay to access, as the corporation looks for new ways to generate commercial income.It will be the first BBC channel available to foreign audiences, showcasing programmes from the archives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant afford surrender contemptible teaching unions","story":"What is going on? Are the hard-Left education unions actually going to manage to delay the partial reopening of our primary schools? Is the great Vote Leave Government, until now an astonishingly successful establishment-slaying machine, about to suffer its first defeat? Are the Michael GoveDominic Cummings schools reforms of the 2010s about to be avenged by a tiny rump of unrepresentative activists convinced that they are refighting the Miners’ Strikes of the 1980s?Let us hope that it is a clever bluff from the Government, a case of “appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak,” as Sun Tzu put it in the Art of War. Boris Johnson can’t afford the unions to defy him. Schools must start reopening on June 1, and the small gang of selfish activists seeking to derail this must be crushed pitilessly.This is not an attack on teachers. With the infection rate collapsing, most are keen to return to some sort of normality, as are heads and governors. They miss the children in their care and have done their best to continue to teach them remotely in the chaos of the past few months. They deserve our utmost gratitude. We should ensure that the return to the classroom takes place as safely as possible.But I strongly object to elitist union leaders who are seeking to sabotage, through undemocratic means, the extraordinarily careful, limited reopening planned by the Government. Theirs is a contemptible ideological act, an offensive, snobbish snub to the millions of workers who have already returned, without complaint, to hospitals, factories, shops, logistics operations and offices.The prolonged closure of our schools – a move I supported, perhaps mistakenly, at the start of this crisis, when the scale of the pandemic, the forms of social interaction most likely to spread it, and the groups most at risk from the virus were all unclear – is fast turning into an educational, social and economic calamity. Millions of children are not being educated at all, others barely so by the end of the summer, they could have fallen 12 months behind, forgetting everything they learnt earlier this year.Others are missing the sport, the clubs and friendships. Some are depressed many poorer children are going to bed hungry abuse cases have shot up. The consequences in terms of social mobility, knowledge, productivity, mental health and crime will plague us for years.The gains in achievement eked out by the GoveCummings reforms in the state school sector, and the return to greater rigour over the past 15 years, could be wiped away. We will tumble down the international Pisa league tables, especially if our schools end up shut for longer than those of our European neighbours. The gap between poor and rich is growing again the private schools, to their credit, are doing far better than the state sector, with some even delivering full, real-time online lessons.The indirect impact is equally cataclysmic. Parents of younger children cannot work at all, Zoom or no Zoom. Millions of others are house-bound: they cannot travel to shops or factories or hospitals or warehouses. Our economy depends on childcare and schooling for parents to be able to operate, especially with grandparents in confinement. The costs in terms of unemployment will be horrific. Hundreds of thousands of lives will be ruined.The real critique of the Government’s plans is that they are too modest, given the dramatic decline in new infections, especially outside care homes: Labour should be arguing that schools should be reopening faster. Why isn’t Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, pointing out that his R-rate has collapsed to almost zero, demanding that all schools in the capital be released from lockdown to allow the city he supposedly cares about to start to recover? Instead, the Left, once again, has allied itself with the barons against the people.It is not as if reopening schools is somehow eccentric. Europe is leading the way, with adaptations for social distancing, without a surge in new infections. It is now clear that almost no children have died from the virus, that they usually suffer far less than adults when they do get it, and that they are unlikely to pass it to adults. Yes, a small number of youngsters have suffered some rare symptoms – but why do the British trade unions believe that what is good for French, German, Danish and Swedish children is too dangerous for British ones?It’s time for the Government to return to its Vote Leave ways, and launch a proper fightback. This is no longer a “national”, “wartime” Government with mass support that therefore needs to tread in a bipartisan way: politics is fast renormalising. Brexit and Tory voters agree with the Government, Labour supporters and Remainers don’t. Sir Keir Starmer is on the warpath.Johnson must consider urgent legislation to force all state schools to reopen, drafted in such a way as to prevent any informal boycotts. The growing number of councils that are refusing to comply should lose control of their schools, with all of them turned into academies. This may be the time to wipe away the Local Education Authority model in its entirety. Schools should also be mandated to keep online lessons going for those year groups still at home. The timing of the summer holidays should be reviewed: the school year must either be extended, or the autumn term should start earlier. Every state school should publish a 12-month plan detailing how they will ensure that children catch up.This crackdown should go hand in hand with leniency in other ways. Parents who are too worried to send their children to school should be allowed to keep them at home until the start of the next academic year. Teachers in vulnerable groups should not be forced to work. The authorities should do everything in their power to minimise risk and pay for plentiful PPE.But our democratically elected Government has the right to reopen state schools, and the unions no right to obstruct it. Johnson cannot allow himself to be cowed into extending the lockdown yet further. He should show some Thatcherite ankle, and call the far-Left’s bluff.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"culture secretary rules regional variation easing lockdown covid","story":"The Culture Secretary has hailed ‘promising’ figures showing only small numbers of people are now testing positive for coronavirus in London.Oliver Dowden said the Government may consider lifting restrictions in ‘micro-hotspots’ when track and trace was in place but ruled out regional variation, saying the intention was to still ‘move as a whole nation’. It comes amid growing unease that economically damaging restrictions are still in place in areas where the virus is virtually eliminated. Last week The  revealed how Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggested fewer than 24 people a day were being infected in London, with the number halving every 3.5 days.New analysis by Oxford University for The  shows that six major London hospital trusts have reported no deaths in the past 48 hours.Homerton, University College London, Hillingdon, North Middlesex, Whittington Health,  and Guy’s and St Thomas\u0027, were recording up to 16 deaths a day at the peak of the crisis, and have totalled more than 1,000 deaths since the start of the epidemic between them.New testing data released this week from PHE also appeared to show that nobody tested positive on Tuesday, although the figures have since been revised to just 14 cases. Mr Dowden agreed that the numbers were ‘promising’ and ‘moving in the right direction.’But when asked by ITV at the daily press briefing whether lockdown could be eased regionally based on the PHE data, he ruled out the idea.“We have to be highly cautious about it,” Mr Dowden said. “The Prime Minister set out the path that we will go down in terms of easing lockdown. The next stage... we said from the earliest will be from the beginning of June.“We want to proceed as fast and as we safely can because clearly there are benefits for children and clearly benefits for the wider economy.“I think it is best though, and the Government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so.”There is increasing concern among some ministers - including the Chancellor - and many Tory MPs about the potential for long-term damage to the economy because of the number of people still off work.The Treasury estimates the coronavirus crisis will cost the economy almost £300 billion this year, and figures released this week showed that 10 million private sector workers are now relying on Government furlough schemes.Getting the capital back to work is key to minimising what Rishi Sunak describes as scarring of the economy, as London generates almost a quarter of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product. The south east as a whole, including London, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP.The new Oxford analysis shows that there 41 of the 131 acute NHS trusts have not reported a single death from coronavirus in the past 48 hours, despite recording 320 deaths between them in the same timeframe around the peak of the crisis on April 7-8.Overall, some 40 per cent of all trusts have recorded no deaths for the past seven days, including 10 major acute trusts, mainly in the south west.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said it was ‘time to unlock.’“We must get on with it.” he said. “London is a significant chunk of the capability of the UK and this is on the decline everywhere. If we behave as the Government has been saying, not so much social distancing, but continuing with the hygiene, my general view is that we need to be lifting lockdown now.”On Wednesday NHS England announced just 166 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,080. The numbers of deaths have been falling by around 100 every seven days for the past month and there are also fewer than 10,000 people in hospital for the first time since March.A declining number of cases and deaths is one of the five tests the Government has set out for the easing of lockdown in the UK.Another is maintaining a low \u0027R\u0027 number, which tracks how many people the average coronavirus patient infects.Data modelling by Cambridge University\u0027s MRC Biostatistics Unit has already suggested the R number in London is significantly lower than elsewhere in the UK, hovering at around 0.4, compared to a national average of at least 0.7.Theresa Villiers, a former Cabinet minister, said the growing evidence for the decline of the virus should allow ministers to feel confident in easing lockdown more quickly using regional variations.“We need to get the economy going again,” she said. “There is real measured progress on getting new cases down that should be the signal to let life get back to normal.” However Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, urged caution.“The stats we are looking at have a few days lag. What we have seen in the past is this, London, is where the virus can flourish, in big cities. “This is fantastic news but the good work needs to be leveraged and not lost by celebrating too soon.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"earlier lockdown could have prevented three quarters uk coronavirus","story":"Three-quarters of coronavirus deaths in Britain might have been avoided if the lockdown had begun a week earlier, modelling suggests. Researchers said that if the UK had imposed the measures seven days earlier its death toll now would be on a par with the 8,000 in Germany.They also said it would have been possible to have a shorter and less economically damaging lockdown.Britain introduced its lockdown measures on March 23, when 359 deaths had been reported. Germany took such steps on the same day, but had reported only 86 fatalities at that time. The UK\u0027s death toll has now exceeded 35,000 people. Modelling from British scientist James Annan suggests that entering lockdown a week earlier would have reduced the number of deaths by three-quarters.Mr Annan, from Blueskiesresearch.org.uk, said an earlier lockdown would have been shorter and had less economic impact. In a related blog, he wrote: Implementing the lockdown one week earlier would have saved about 30,000 lives in the current wave (based on official numbers, which are themselves a substantial underestimate). It would also have made for a shorter, cheaper, less damaging lockdown in economic terms.Modellers said the calculations showed that even small changes in the timing of interventions could make a significant difference. Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, said: In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of cases is growing exponentially. This means even a small change in the rate of spread or in the timing of interventions can make a big difference a short period of time down the line.It is clear that, had we locked down sooner, we would have reduced the spread earlier, limiting the number of cases and consequently the number of deaths. The other benefit of locking down earlier would have been bringing cases under control sooner and potentially allowing the release of lockdown sooner.The modelling was revealed on Radio 4\u0027s More or Less programme, which highlighted differences in the testing regimes used by different countries earlier in the epidemic, with Germany carrying out 50,000 tests daily at a time when the UK could not even achieve that weekly. As a result, at the point both countries entered lockdown, Germany had identified around 27,000 cases, when the UK had confirmed just 9,000, researchers said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern flags four day working week way rebuild new zealand","story":"New Zealand is considering introducing a four-day working week to help boost domestic tourism, productivity and employment after the Covid-19 crisis battered the country’s economy.On Wednesday Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern flagged the idea of using the shorter working week and additional public holidays as part of a “nimble” and creative approach to resuscitating the economy.New Zealand’s strict seven-week lockdown has been praised around the world for stopping the spread of Covid-19 in its tracks, with the nation of five million people now having 35 active cases and just one coronavirus patient in hospital. In total, New Zealand has had 1,153 Covid-19 cases and 21 deaths.But strict travel bans have meant tourism and hospitality sectors, which play a vital role in the New Zealand economy, have been hard hit.“This is an extraordinary time and we should be willing to consider extraordinary ideas,” Ms Ardern said. “I haven\u0027t ruled anything in or out.”She added that the government should be open minded about the “range of options” available to policy makers.Between March 2018 and March 2019 tourism generated NZ$16.2 billion, 5.8 per cent of the country’s GDP. The indirect value added by industries supporting tourism generated an additional NZ$11.2 billion.Representatives of the industry, which prior to the crisis employed about 230,000 people, met with the prime minister on Tuesday. After these talks, Ms Ardern said working from home during lockdown had shown how productive employees could be if given more flexibility.“Think about if that\u0027s something that would work for your workplace, because it certainly would help tourism all around the country,” she said.New Zealand launched an ambitious plan to eliminate coronavirus using early and aggressive lockdown and travel bans. As early as April 27 Ms Ardern claimed her country had won the battle after four weeks of heavy restrictions.“There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand, she proclaimed. We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.On May 11 the country reopened schools and offices, as well as restaurants and cafes following. Strict social distancing measures in cafes meant Ms Ardern was turned away from dining only to be chased down the road by the owner and offered a seat when one became safely available.International borders remain closed but with New Zealanders now free to travel within the country, tourism operators and airlines ramping up services to meet rapidly growing demand. A three-day weekend and extra holidays could provide a significant boost to business.In 2018 a New Zealand company that moved to a four-day week, while retaining five-day pay, for a two-month trial found the change boosted productivity among its 240 employees. The firm, Perpetual , which manages trusts, wills and estates, found that staff spending more time with their families, exercising, cooking and gardening, returned to work enthusiastic and energetic. Workers said the change motivated them to use new ways to increase productivity while in the office, including reducing meeting times from two hours to 30 minutes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"young adults likely age group infected coronavirus new data","story":"Young adults are the most likely age group to be infected with coronavirus, new figures suggest. Snapshot surveillance data suggests that those aged 17 to 29 are the most likely group to carry the infection - although they are far less likely than older people to fall seriously ill.The sampling by Public Health England (PHE), which occurred as the epidemic approached its peak, showed that in early April, around 11 per cent of those aged between 17 and 29 were infected with the virus.Those in their 30s were the age group with the second highest number of infections, at around 10 per cent, with rates closer to seven per cent among those in their 60s.Scientists said the findings reflected the fact young people were the most likely to socialise, and may also have been more likely to flout lockdown advice. The three-week period began on March 23 - the day the lockdown was introduced - meaning many of the findings would reflect social patterns before strict rules came in. Across the capital, levels of infection fell with age, the data suggests. Charts which show prevalence of infection in five age groups from 17-29 up to those aged between 60 and 70, in different regions, over three weeks, show that by and large, levels of infection fell with age. By contrast, the risk of dying from coronavirus rises sharply with age, with 26,800 deaths in those aged 75 and over, compared with around 400 in those aged 44 and under, official statistics show. Professor Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia said: “Young people are the most likely to socialise and the least likely to stick to social distancing guidelines.“So from that viewpoint, it’s not that surprising. In London it shows by April 12 around 11 per cent of 17 to 29 year olds had the infection, compared to seven per cent of those aged 60 to 70 – so a difference of more than half.”Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE\u0027s head of immunisation, said the findings about infection levels were the “exact opposite” to what was being seen in patterns of disease, where older people were far more affected. People who become infected with Covid-19 do not always become ill, with estimates that around one third of those carrying the virus do not show symptoms.Dr Ramsay told a webinar: “We see disease in older adults predominantly, whereas with infection we appear to be seeing it in younger adults.“It’s a very interesting finding and quite possibly unexpected. I think even the modelers found it unexpected that the infection rates appear to be higher in the young adults.“We have limited data from other regions, but the patterns are similar” Health Service Journal reported. The data suggests that over the three weeks ending on April 12, the rate of coronavirus infection rose from 3 per cent to 11 per cent among those aged between 17 and 29 in London.Dr Ramsay said: “We think that probably reflects the incidents just before the lockdown period. “What was fascinating was finding that it suggests transmission in London among young adults was particularly high, even though we were seeing the disease in a very different age group.Since late February, PHE has analysed thousands of blood samples from people across the country as part of a “seroprevalence study” carried out under the fourth pillar of the Government’s testing strategy. Dr Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: “This is ongoing research and needs to be treated with caution, however it is helping us to better understand how the transmission of Covid-19 may be happening and we will be publishing further details in due course.“This is just one element of a range of surveillance systems that PHE has in place to monitor the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/10/22/sunak-budget.jpg","title":"uk investors government debt gilt yields negative","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.As the UK\u0027s Debt Management Office auctions debt with a negative yield for the first time in history, why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money? And what does it mean for the government and for ordinary people?The UK government auctioned a tranche of debt to the financial markets on Wednesday which, for the first time in history, had a negative yield.That means that if the investors were to hold the debt until it matured they would get less back than they paid for it.Government borrowing this year heading to £300bn, says OBRSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money?And why is it happening now?What does it mean for the public finances?And how could it affect the livelihoods of ordinary people?The Debt Management Office, a public body that sells state debt on behalf of the Government, auctioned a parcel of state debt worth £3.75bn to financial investors, a group that generally includes banks, insurance companies, pension managers and hedge funds.The parcel of debt – known as a Gilt-edged security or “Gilt” – is due to mature in July 2023, which is the date that the holders of the Gilt would be repaid their money by the government.The yield on the Gilt is the effective annual interest rate that the investors receive and is determined by the price investors pay to buy the security.The yield on this Gilt, as set by a competitive auction, was -0.003 per cent.Gilt yields have been very low for many years, but this is the first time that the yield on a Gilt has been negative. And the implication is that the investors would ultimately lose money on their investment.Why on earth would investors buy these bonds if it guarantees they will lose money?First it’s important to note that negative yielding government debt has been a feature of several other governments’ bond markets in recent years.Japan and Germany have issued debt at negative yields for some time.Indeed the total value of negative yielding debt around the world at the end of last year was $11 trillion, having peaked at $17 trillion. That’s around a sixth of the total global bond market.Negative yields remain something of a puzzle, but the most common explanation from analysts is that investors, in an era of considerable uncertainty and volatility in markets, are prepared to pay a big premium for the confidence that they will get most of their money back, even if it means a slight loss.Regulation may play a part too, with pension funds, banks and insurance companies effectively compelled since the global financial crisis by regulators to hold more liquid (easily sellable) assets like government bonds as a share of their total assets.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt may also be that some investors are speculating that Government bond prices are going to go up even more in future and that they will still be able to sell their own holdings at a profit in future, even if they have a negative yield when they buy them.So why have UK yields only gone negative now?The most likely explanation is that it’s because the Bank of England has signalled in recent days that it is considering taking its main interest rate negative for the first time.Central bank interest rates tend to have a big influence on bond yields.Why has the interest rate on UK debt fallen to record lows?Those countries that have seen negative yields already have negative interest rates from their own central banks.The Bank is also expected to announce more Gilt purchases soon as part of its response to the Covid-19 recession, which may be bolstering the confidence of some speculators that they will be able to sell their negative yielding Gilts to the central bank at a profit.“The impact of the Bank of England’s rate cuts and increased asset purchases is absolutely clear from this morning’s groundbreaking gilt auction,” said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.What does this mean for the Government?In the immediate term it signals strong market demand for Government debt, which is comforting at a time when it is expecting to issue more than £300bn of Gilts in order to pay for its emergency coronavirus spending.Low or negative yields also mean that the Government does not need to worry much about the annual costs of servicing that borrowing.What does it all mean for ordinary people?A government with stable market financing is good news for people receiving state assistance in this crisis because it diminishes the risk these programmes would have to be ended suddenly because the government could not borrow.However, the fact that bond yields are so low probably reflects pessimism from investors about the economy’s medium and long-term economic prospects.If investors thought the economy was going to grow strongly in the years and decades ahead they would be expecting higher inflation in the years ahead and would probably be charging the government more to borrow in the form of higher yields.If investors are right about the bleak overall economic outlook that’s bad news for ordinary workers and households.And low bond yields means the return on many pension saving pots will be lower, meaning people might have to work longer to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.

It’s an approach Theroux has largely maintained throughout his career his unique brand of bumbling, placid interviewing has won him numerous Baftas and international fame.Some of his films are impossibly moving. Others are so ludicrously funny they’ve spawned countless memes and a Twitter account called No Context Louis Theroux.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo mark Theroux\u0027s 50th birthday, here are seven of his most brilliant documentaries…The Most Hated Family in America (2007)This lid-lifting documentary introduces viewers to the Kansas family at the core of the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members believe the US government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality.Tiger King: Louis Theroux says he ‘liked’ Joe ExoticLouis Theroux launches first podcast series from coronavirus lockdownBBC defends Louis Theroux documentary from damning claimsThe hugely controversial Christian ministry is notorious for picketing at military funerals with homophobic placards, claiming that soldiers were killed because God hates gay people.It’s an extremely uncomfortable watch, like much of Theroux’s best work, and a topic that has been revisited twice by the filmmaker in 2011’s America’s Most Hated Family in Crisis and 2019’s Surviving America’s Most Hated Family.This is one of Theroux’s most heart-rending documentaries, in which he interviews dementia sufferers and their loved ones. In it, we meet a 49-year-old mother who is unable to grasp the seriousness of her own deterioration, and whose husband is anxious about raising their young daughter alone.There are moments of lightness, too, with a mischievous 89-year-old called Nancy teasing and flirting with Theroux in some of her more lucid moments.It doesn’t have the shock factor of some of his most famous films, but it’s a poignant insight into how love can endure such a devastating condition.This film sees Theroux head off to Portland, Oregon, to investigate polyamory. It is 60 minutes of perfect awkwardness.Three groups of people of varying willingness to be in open relationships are interviewed, and at one point Theroux strips off and attends a naked “sensual eating workshop”.Drinking to Oblivion (2016)In this staggeringly moving watch, Theroux embeds himself at King’s College Hospital in south London, where he interviews patients whose alcoholism is so severe that it has put them at death’s door.Joe, who is on his third day of detox, is one of the most memorable addicts featured. When we meet him, he’s spent the last few months drinking a bottle or two of vodka a day and is in withdrawal, petrified and hardly able to stand.From 32-year-old Joe to a woman who’s been on eight cans of cider a day for the past three decades, the subjects are very varied in an astonishing film that gives a face to an addiction suffered by half a million people in England.A Place for Paedophiles (2009)Theroux gains incredible access in this unsettling film shot in California’s Coalinga Mental Hospital. More than 500 convicted paedophiles are housed in the institution, many of whom have already served prison sentences but are deemed too dangerous for release.One of the sex offenders there has undergone castration in an attempt to secure his release, while another confessed to molesting 50 children.At the time, Theroux said Coalinga was “the weirdest place” he had “ever been to”, which, coming from a man who has spent time with Nazis, Scientologists and Tiger King’s Joe Exotic, is quite a statement.Louis and the Nazis (2003)This is one of Theroux’s most famous documentaries. It sees the filmmaker travel to California to spend time with the White Aryan Resistance, a group that includes 11-year-old twin sisters who have been taught to sing racist pop songs by their mother. It’s one of the rare films that shows Theroux almost lose his temper. When he comes face to face with the people who are perpetuating so much hatred, he doesn’t look shy or confused as he often does, instead he is genuinely raging.In this left-field festive special, Theroux brings together four of the characters he met during his Weird Weekends series to pull crackers with him in his Brooklyn apartment. From a man who claims to channel messages from the alien planet Koldas to another who spent 28 years living in a hole in Idaho, it’s an eclectic mix of guests. The show will put any chaotic Christmas dinners you’ve had into perspective.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Google Docs, and to a lesser extent Apple’s Pages, let users create a document or table that can be shared in its totality quickly and easily via a link or through downloading the file.Fluid Framework, however, is focused on people creating components of documents – such as text, tables, lists, and graphs.Microsoft wants to \u0027read people\u0027s brain waves\u0027 to mine cryptocurrencyThese components can be updated and editable at any time, no matter where they are created or how they are shared. These can then be incorporated into other Microsoft products, such as Teams (its collaboration platform and Slack competitor).In order to attract someone’s attention to a component that has been created, Fluid workspaces have ‘recommended’ lists and the ability to tag someone through what Microsoft calls “@mentions”.Microsoft is hoping that this infrastructure will become the future of workplace collaboration. The Fluid preview and, it can be assumed, future versions of the software is currently available on the latest version of all major browsers: Microsoft Edge, Apple’s Safari (but only on Apple computers), Google Chrome, and Mozilla’s Firefox.Xbox Live feature turned off as Microsoft reports \u0027record numbers\u0027Microsoft reveals range of new details about Xbox Series XBill Gates’ coronavirus testing programme is testing 300 people a dayWhile the roll-out will take time, it will begin with the web versions of Office and Outlook before eventually coming to Teams later in the year. Eventually, Fluid will be compatible with all Office programmes including Excel, Word, and Powerpoint on the desktop.As well as its new framework, Microsoft also announced developments for Teams including customisable templates, more manageable chatbots, and the ability to add custom applications to Teams with a dedicated button.​Outlook is also receiving new features including text predictions, which Google’s Gmail has had for two years, while Microsoft Edge is receiving sidebar searching (so you can search without opening a new window) and automatic profile switching. The latter will be a useful feature for those who use Edge for both work and personal browsing, as it will automatically switch to your work profile when it detects a link you’re trying to open needs specific credentials.Finally, Microsoft is introducing new tools to PowerToys, its free system utilities, including “PowerToys Run”, a searchbar which allows users to quickly access system tools like the registry or the startup utility settings, while also letting you remap keys and search for files.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Inside of it can be seen a spiral structure with a “twist” – which could be the trademark indication of a new world being formed.The research could help us understand how the many thousands of exoplanets that lie scattered through the universe first came about, the scientists say, by allowing them to watch the actual process that gives birth to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Thousands of exoplanets have been identified so far, but little is known about how they form,” said Anthony Boccaletti who led the study from the Observatoire de Paris, PSL University, France.While scientists know that planets are born as dusty discs surround young stars, where cold gas and dust are clumped together, the new observations give new information about that process.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien life“We need to observe very young systems to really capture the moment when planets form,” he said.The new images show a hug spiral of dust and gas that has formed around AB Aurigae, a star found 520 lightyears away. Those spirals are an indication that baby planets are being born, since the worlds disturb the gas in ways that can be seen from Earth.As the planet rotates around its star, the wave follows the shape of a spiral arm. It is the “twist” in the new images that indicates one of those disturbances, and therefore an indication that a new planet is being made.“The twist is expected from some theoretical models of planet formation,” said co-author Anne Dutrey, from the Astrophysics Laboratory of Bordeaux.“It corresponds to the connection of two spirals – one winding inwards of the planet’s orbit, the other expanding outwards – which join at the planet location. They allow gas and dust from the disc to accrete onto the forming planet and make it grow.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That such a galaxy could form so early in the history of the universe indicates that our traditional understanding – where galaxies build up in hierarchies, late in the history of the cosmos – could be wrong.The discovery could help answer the puzzle over one of the most profound questions in cosmology: how the universe changed from its bland, formless state at its very beginning to the complex and structured web of stars and galaxies that surround us today.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being by far the earliest such disc ever spotted, it is also the most distant ever seen, and it is so far away that scientists are able to see it at a point when the universe was only a tenth of its current age. The object, nicknamed the Wolfe Disc, is spinning at 170 miles per second and has a mass 72 billion times that of our Sun.Our current understanding of galaxies suggests that dark matter “halos” first develop, which then pull in surrounding gas and merge into bigger structures from which stars are formed. As time goes on, that leads to the growth of galaxies.Comet flying towards Earth could be visible with the naked eyeSuch a model suggests that as the gas falls into the disc, it is heated up, leaving a spherical structure that has to cool before it can support the formation of a disc.But the newly discovered galaxy contains a cold, dusty, rotating disc, despite the fact that it formed so early in the universe. That suggests that the gas could have been cool as it fell into the nascent galaxy, allowing for the disc to form quickly.If that is the case, massive gas discs could form 2.5 billion years earlier than scientists had thought, according to the research published by Marcel Neeleman and colleagues in Nature.Such “cold-mode accretion” would change our picture of when and how such disc galaxies – which includes our own Milky Way – are able to form. That in turn could change our comprehension of the universe, by allowing us a better picture of how matter is first assembled into the larger structures that surround us.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Xavier Prochaska, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor of the paper. “Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.”The finding is based only on one galaxy and so it is difficult to generalise from the findings, notes Alfred Tiley from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research​, who did not work on the study, in an accompanying article. As such, similar observations of more galaxies are required before scientists can say that the newly discovered disc is representative of a broader trend, he writes.“Nevertheless, Neeleman and colleagues’ findings will excite astronomers, and open up a new epoch of the Universe’s history for the study of early galaxy formation,” Dr Tiley concludes.The research, ‘A cold, massive, rotating disk galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang’, is published in Nature today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The announcement was made less than a day after Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised almost £33m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden, was given a knighthood. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, also announced ministers would match the funding raised by the BBC’s Big Night In to the tune of £70m. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Queen’s birthday honours list was due to be published next month. Its contents were agreed before the UK was severely hit by the global pandemic, however. Ministers felt it was more appropriate if the list was delayed to include those who have battled on the frontlines against Covid-19.Mr Dowden also announced that £150m would be “unlocked” from dormant bank accounts to help charities respond to the coronavirus crisis. The chancellor has previously announced a  £750m pot to help charities. Experts warn that charity funding has collapsed, with shops closed and many households tightening their belts. Of the £150m, £10m will be for the Youth Futures Foundation to help organisations who support disadvantaged young people into work.Another £45m will help charities, social enterprises and some small businesses facing cash-flow problems.Mr Dowden said: “Charities and social enterprises are playing a vital role in our national effort against coronavirus.“This funding will support organisations that are at the heart of their communities, building on our unprecedented package of financial support for the voluntary sector.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The EU wants what it calls a level playing-field clause in the deal, under which the UK would stay in tune with some regulations such as state aid and environmental protections.Former Tory minister calls for ‘phased’ end to free movementUK blames EU’s ‘ideological’ approach for lack of Brexit progressIn a broadside at the approach taken by the UK negotiator, Mr Barnier said: I do not think, however, that an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points.He said the EU was sticking to the political declaration that had been signed by Boris Johnson and which spells out the approach both sides would take to their future relationship.In his letter on Tuesday, Mr Frost said Brussels\u0027 proposed deal contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards. The UK published its own legal text on Tuesday, which the EU has already been privately privy for a number of weeks.But Mr Barnier said: The UK cannot expect high-quality access to the EU Single Market if it is not prepared to accept guarantees to ensure that competition remains open and fair. The EU has been clear about this since 2017.The chief negotiator said this would not mean that the UK would be bound by EU law after the end of the transition period in these areas and that the UK will remain entirely free to set its own higher standards but that we need to give ourselves concrete, mutual and reciprocal guarantees for this to happen.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task \u0026amp Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks continued shortages of personal protective equipment and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.Department of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The timeline has been criticised for being unrealistic.In announcing the resignation, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was vague but praising of Mr Loverro, saying he hit the ground running and made significant progress. Next week will mark the beginning of a new era in human space flight with the launch of NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station.In partnership with SpaceX, the mission will be the first time since 2011 that humans have reached orbit from US soil.Mr Loverro, who was reportedly scheduled to lead a final technical review meeting on Thursday ahead of the launch, had been a vocal advocate of the Artemis programme right up until his departure on Monday.Retired naval aviator, Ken Bowersol will step up into the role of acting head of human space flight from his existing role of deputy associate administrator.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Indonesian government has done little to stop the trade of wildlife in the country\u0027s markets.Earlier this month, a coalition of animal rights groups wrote to Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo warning him of the risks posed by the trade of wildlife, as well as dog and cat meat, in the country’s live animal markets.The Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition wrote: “Despite the worsening situation of the pandemic globally and throughout Indonesia, with all 34 provinces now affected and over 13,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 1,000 deaths nationwide, the sale of wild animals including bats, rats and reptiles alongside dogs and cats and other domesticated animals in markets throughout the country continues unchallenged.“This is in defiance to ever-growing calls from governments, inter-governmental human and animal health experts and key stakeholders from around the world for the immediate closure of live animal markets globally.“It is impossible to ensure that meat sold at these markets is safe for human consumption, and given the unhygienic conditions, it is only a matter of time before the next deadly zoonotic disease emerges.”The Animals Asia Foundation was one of the charities in the coalition who signed the letter. The founder, Dr Jill Robinson MBE, expressed her “100 per cent” support for The Independent’s campaign to ban the wildlife trade.Founder of leading animal charity backs The Independent\u0027s campaignDr Robinson told The Independent that live animal markets are “dirty, dangerous places” that cannot be properly regulated, least of all in countries where “no animal welfare regulations exist, or are poorly enforced if they do”.The trade of wildlife was thrown into the spotlight as the coronavirus is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 27 of the first 41 people who became infected with Covid-19 had been exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, according to a study published in medical journal, The Lancet.Researchers believe the Covid-19 jumped from an animal to a human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The local administration in the Chinese city said on Wednesday that along with the consumption ban, Wuhan would become a “wildlife sanctuary” where virtually all hunting of wild animals was banned with the exception of measures for ”scientific research, population regulation, monitoring of epidemic diseases and other special circumstances”. As part of the ban, the city introduced stringent controls on the breeding of all wild animals, prohibiting any to be reared for food, CBS reported. Wuhan will also join a wider scheme across the country to offer buyouts to farmers who breed wild animals.​Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFounder of leading animal charity backs The Independent’s campaignWoman jailed for illegal trade in wildlife has sentence doubledArmy of volunteers ‘could be used to fight off invasive species’Coronavirus fears as China plans to entrench mink and fox fur industryWuhan, a city of 11m people in the Hubei province of China, saw the first cases of Covid-19 late last year. The origins of the pandemic are still being investigated but one of the suspected sources is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city which included a live animal section reportedly selling more than 30 species of animals including live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions and civets. China closed the market in January.On the whole, researchers agree that the most plausible explanation is that the virus made the jump from an animal to human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.China has been under pressure from the global community to tackle its illegal wildlife trade after it was linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Coronavirus: China’s farmers offered buy-out to end wildlife breedingThe global death toll is now 318,789 people from the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation reported today. More than 4.7m people have been infected worldwide. Last week, two central provinces in China announced plans for a government buy-out for wildlife farmers to help transition those whose livelihoods depend on breeding wild species for consumption away from the practice.The plans would give wildlife farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, two neighbouring regions, the opportunity to be compensated for switching to grow fruit, vegetables, tea plants, or herbs for traditional Chinese medicine. There is also an option to breed other animals such as pigs and chickens.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each wild goose or Chinese muntjac deer will be worth 2,457 yuan ($345) each.In February, China issued an unprecedented temporary nationwide ban on all terrestrial wild animal commerce and consumption, including exotic species raised on farms. The initial buy-out covers 14 species of farmed wildlife and only farms operating legally with breeding permits before the February ban are eligible for the programme.At present, the Wuhan ban lasts for five years. Similar bans are in place in the cities of Beijing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai but they have been made permanent.Dr Peter Li, Humane Society International’s China policy specialist, said: “Wuhan’s ban on wildlife consumption is extremely welcome as a clear recognition that the public health risk of zoonotic disease spread via the wildlife trade must be taken very seriously if we are to avoid another pandemic.There will however be no less severe of a disease risk from wildlife consumption in five years’ time, so anything short of a permanent and comprehensive ban is still a risk too far. Wuhan becomes the fourth city in mainland China to show such leadership, but we now need cities and countries across the world to step up to the plate and shut down the dangerous wildlife trade.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

Contactless payment is thought to be a must ­and some may use new apps to order and pay.It is easier to space drinkers out in a beer garden and scientists say the virus spreads less outside, compared to within enclosed spaces.That means it will be a while before small, cosy pubs re-open their doors to customers.But big pubs where there is enough room inside to keep people apart could be next to get the nod — again with table service to avoid a build-up at bars.Perspex screens, like those seen in supermarkets, could be used to shield diners from other tables and walkways.Eventually, when ordering at a bar is allowed — perhaps in the autumn — screens might also be put up on the counters.Environment Secretary George Eustice told the Commons: We are already working with the hospitality and pub sector to identy what social distancing measures they might be able to put in place.“As the Prime Minister has outlined, we intend that the hospitality sector, including pubs, would be able to tentatively start gradually opening, hopefully during July — subject to the epidemiology supporting such a move.”He was referring to phase three of the lockdown easing plan, which includes pubs. The talks come as welcome news for lockdown Brits keen to catch up with friends and family over a pint away from home.Mr Eustice added: Of course we also recognise that until thingsto something closer to normal and they can open normally, hopefully later this summer, then it will not give them all of the trade they previously had.There were fears that pubs might not reopen until Christmas because of the dficulties with social distancing.Pub bosses on Monday called for the two-metrerule to be halved.In some cases it would allow so few customers it might not be economical to open.Simon Emeny, the chief executive of brewer Fuller’s, said the World Health Organisation advises one metre— which would allow four times as many customers. He said: “I think it’s really important that rules are relaxed by the time pubs reopen.”Jonathan Neame, chief executive of Shepherd Neame, said it would be “profoundly challenging” to keep people two metres apart ­and that could force most pubs to stay shut.”The British Beer and Pub Association’s chief executive Emma McClarkin warned that a long-term shutdown would have a devastating impact on an industry already in decline.“We stand ready to work with the Government to help pubs re-open in a safe and financially viable way as soon as possible.“Actioning advice from the WHO — for example to use one metre for social distancing from July — would enable many more pubs to viably re-open and serve their communities again.”Brewers and pubs have already had to dispose of the equivalent of million pints of beer that had gone stale.Opening pub gardens gives them some hope — and would allow the two-metre rule to stay for now. In mid-May Boris Johnson laid out the first careful steps of easing the coronavirus lockdown as part of a three-phase plan to get back to normal le.In an address to the nation he revealed a detailed roadmap of how to get Britain back on its feet, but still keep the deadly virus under control.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then, you see the yard and think ‘wow, that’s somewhat surprising’.“Then, you see the interior, and think well that’s not quite what I expected. And before you know it - WHAT THE F*** IS HAPPENING HERE ”The Pittsburgh resident told Bored Panda he across the listing on line.“The front exterior photo is completely unremarkable. It’s very typical of the s Suburban Pittsburgh housing vernacular, particularly in the eastern suburbs, he said.“That’s the kind of home they built for middle-class families in the last days of steel. The first surprise came with the photos of the backyard.“Not only is the yard larger than one would suspect, but swimming pools are exceedingly rare in this region, due to the hilly topography and small window of summer-like temperatures.“Each successive photo reveals another genre-themed room, with an increasing level of commitment.It’s like a miniature amusement park or a home-sized movie studio.

They had two daughters Kiristiana, , and Alicia, .It is believed Mr Tachmintzis was so concerned about security he kept Dobermans as guard dogs and employed staff to stand on his gate.One neighbour told MailOnline: “I ride my horse down the road every day and all of a sudden I realised around three years ago that the people there had just disappeared.“I just thought at first that they had gone away somewhere and would then come back – but nobody did. It is most strange.“At first the gates were just shut and then a padlock and chain appeared on them. You could just see the grass getting longer and longer and growing around the cars.“Nobody around here has a clue what happened to them and why they just upped and left. It is a real mystery.“They obviously had loads of money because it is a big house. There were always lots of comings and goings with dferent people going in and out.“They used to have up to three Dobermans. His two daughters would walk them, and sometimes the cleaner would take them out, but they were too big for her to handle and she had to stop.“One day around six-years-ago, this guy in his s came out and said that his dogs had gone missing and he askedwe had seen them, but we hadnt.“The girls were dark haired and very pretty. I think they used to go to a local health club and gym.”Another villager said he heard Mr Tachmintzis made a huge deal involving a luxury property on the exclusive Sandbanks resort in Dorset.They said: “I believe his we had cancer and died several years ago.“He also had a housekeeper, but she left suddenly.

It can affect you,” Schultz told BuzzFeed.“I knew what I thought going in [about the coronavirus]. I didn’t think it was as serious as it was until after things started happening.“I thought I was young enough for it not to affect me, and I know a lot of people think that.“I was so weak. This was one of the most frustrating parts. I couldn’t hold my cellphone — it was so heavy. I couldn’t type, because my hands shook so much.”Schultz, who was hospitalized on March , had traveled to Boston to visit his boyfriend, Josh Hebblethwaite, , on March .A week before, they had been to a festival in Miami Beach where at least  people later contracted COVID- and three men died.But Schultz said there were no real restrictions in place, though. No lockdowns.Days after arriving in Boston, he began feeling ill and was soon rushed to hospital with a -degree fever and his lungs full of liquid.He was given oxygen and sedated before being transferred to another hospital where he was intubated for over four weeks.“There was no one  around, and I would be the one to make decisions for him,” Hebblethwaite said. “It was definitely scary.”“About four weeks in, the nurses were nice enough to FaceTime with him.It was pretty much like he was in a coma. It was definitely scary. But I was so happy to see him at that point.”The couple say theyve received a lot of abuse for attending the Florida festival, with some people saying Schultz deserved to get sick.But he said the positive feedback has outweighed the negative comments.After being released from hospital, he enjoyed the two double cheeseburgers, small fries and a strawberry shake he ordered at McDonald’s, although he said his taste was somewhat affected.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its vast bureaucratic institutions were utterly unable to react to the threat of the virus.So the inidual countries did it all for themselves. Each following a dferent policy. When the moment came, the EU was found wanting. Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders. And that the best way of controlling those borders is through a nation state.The Greeks have been trying to contain a mass influx of refugees from Turkey — and getting no help from the EU in the process. Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real.

I know the league has signed big deals with the broad- casters. But the sensible thing surely would have been to call the season null and void, across all three isions.Those of us who, like me, support clubs who had a chance of promotion will get over our disappointment.There are more important things than football.So let’s look at Sweden. It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead they will expand existing border screening to carry out the additional checks.And the government documents made clear that the checks will be conducted by UK border officials, snubbing EU demands to have their own personnel carrying out checks.It set up another big row with Brussels, which wanted to install a permanent base in Northern Ireland to oversee the checks.But Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who unveiled the UK plans in the Commons on Wednesday, admitted that Northern Ireland will have to follow EU rules on agriculture and manufactured goods until at least .The key concession will ensure access to the EU’s single market and keep the border with the Republic of Ireland free-flowing in order to maintain the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement.The Government paper said having a so-called “mini-EU embassy” in Belfast would be “isive” and called on Brussels to “respect the UK’s territorial integrity”.It also promised Northern Ireland businesses would benefit from “unfettered access” when selling goods to the rest of the UK.

The vital vessels will resupply Royal Navy aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates. For national security reasons, Royal Navy warships can only be built in the UK.But because the supply ships will be part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, they are not classed as warships – meaning they could be built abroad. The competition for the contract was offered worldwide, with companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea shortlisted along with a UK consortium. The British team, backed by the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, included Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. The prospect of building British naval ships abroad when the UK was leaving the EU and reasserting itself globally horried campaigners and triggered a split in government. The tendering process was stopped abruptly in November – raising hopes the terms could be reset to boost British firmsapos chances of winning the deal.  Experts believe the UK team is now favourite to secure the contract, and hope a decision will be made before the end of the year. Labour called on the Government to inject much-needed optimism into the sector and make an announcement now – giving British steelmakers enough time to draw up bids to supply metal for the vesselsapos hulls. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: When thousands are out of work and businesses are struggling due to coronavirus, the Ministry of Defence should be spending and building in the UK to help support British jobs.  The Government must now commit to building future Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, including the Fleet Solid Support ships, in British shipyards and to buying British, so that our world-leading industries like steel are first in line to supply the parts to build these ships. GMB national officer Ross Murdoch, who is also maritime chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: “At a time of national crisis when two million people are projected to lose their jobs, this £.billion contract should be awarded to UK yards to give the economy the shot in the arm that it desperately needs. “We need to ensure that as much British material is used to build these ships as possible. “This contract would be a vital boost to our strategic industries, including steel. “It is time to build back up the UKaposs strategic manufacturing capabilities, and keeping this contract in this country would be the first step towards achieving that aim.” Community steelworkersapos union operations director Alasdair McDiarmid said: “The Government should award this deal to the UK shipyard and then ensure as much British steel is used as possible.  “It’s important that the procurement is done the right way, which means giving UK steel producers enough notice of the specications and requirements so they are able to supply the steel that’s needed. “These major projects should be an opportunity to boost vital industries and support our manufacturing communities, especially during these challenging times.” UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said: “UK steel producers have the capacity and capability to supply high-quality steel into projects such as this.

Englandaposs primaries were told to prepare to bring back year R,  and  pupils back to class, with other primary years ing later in June.  But those plans were hurled into doubt by a mass revolt from unions and councils. Liverpool, Hartlepool, Birmingham, and even Tory-run Solihull and Essex have warned June  might not be possible. Some are looking at later dates, some are still waiting to see what will happen, and some are suggesting s may be part-time - despite the government saying this isnapost an option.Schools are of course already open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. But plans to open them more widely - which involves halving class sizes, hiding away toys, having staggered breaks and making corridors one-way - have ided many in the teaching profession. They need time to prepare, and also want to see the full scientic evidence on whether itaposll be safe. Scientists have also said the government should wait until after a delayed test, track and trace app is up and running. AskedLabour would back councils refusing to open on June , a spokesman for Keir Starmer said: “Ultimately councils will want to do what is in the best interests of children and families in their respective area. The infection rate ies from area to area so it’s not surprising some councils have particular concerns.” The government has insisted the June  date was at the earliest and schools wouldnapost be reopenedit was unsafe. Today one minister, Robert Buckland, admitted they may not open unormly across England. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they will remain shut to the wider population. So what have dissenting councils in England said  Hereaposs what we know so far. These are all the areas weaposve found so far expressing doubt about the governmentaposs plans. But the situation is changing fast so itaposs inevitable some are probably left out. If you know one which should be added to this list, please e-mail dan.bloom@mirror. Barking and Dagenham Council leader Darren Rowell: “I cannot support any school reopeningit puts at risk the safety of our teachers, staff and young people.. Simply forcing schools to reopen without taking steps to reduce the risk of the virus spread is unacceptable… We can’t put people at risk by rushing back to normality before it’s safe.” Birmingham We only support Birmingham schools opening to more pupils when it is safe to do so. We are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on  June.  Bradford Bradford Council has no intention of directing schools to open on June  or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open. Parents will not be finedthey choose not to send their children back to school at this time. Brighton and Hove We have strongly advised our schools that they should only reopen to more children when their risk assessments indicate it is safe to do so. It is likely that wider re-opening will happen at dferent times for dferent schools and for dferent numbers of children, given each school’s particular circumstances. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees: You cannot just make a blanket statement on Bristol. What we’ve said is we will back our schools to make the decision they have to make. Bury While high levels of Covid- infection in the north west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be re-opening schools on June .  Calderdale Adam Wilkinson, lead member for children and young people: We are advising schools in Calderdale not to extend opening on  June. We are keen to get more pupils back to school, but safety is of paramount importance  we have been advised by public health professionals that governments key tests have not been met. Durham Schools in County Durham are being advised that they should only start a phased reopening when they feel it is safe to do so.  Essex Whilst all schools are working hard to respond to the guidance provided by the Department for Education, depending on each inidual school context, some primary, infant and junior schools may not be able to offer full-time provision for the relevant year groups, and any new arrangements may not be introduced exactly from the st June. Gateshead We have absolute confidence that each school will determine the risk, and will make the right decision for their schools, pupils, staff and parents. The council will fully support any school that after careful consideration of all these factors, determines that they cannot comply with government instruction. Hartlepool We have agreed [schools] will not reopen on Monday  June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british airways should hand back","story":"NewsBritish Airways should hand back the British flag over coronavirus job cuts - Labour MPA Labour MP lashed out at the UK flag carrier, which plans to slash jobs as it deals with the Covid- crisisShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBA is among airlines which have grounded planes during the pandemic \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

British Airline Pilotsapos Association general secretary Brian Strutton told MPs carriers were “egging the pudding too much to take advantage of the crisis”. British Airways came under heavy attack during a two-hour session of the cross-party Commons Transport Select Committee. There were also hints passengers could boycott the carrierpotential fliers were unhappy with BAaposs actions. BA is among several airlines planning redundancies as the aviation industry battles the Covid- crisis. Planes across the globe were effectively grounded as lockdown and travel restrictions were imposed. Ryanair plans , jobs losses and to cut staff pay by up to a fth.  Virgin Atlantic plans to cut more than , jobs and shut its operations at Gatwick Airport. BA has announced plans to axe , posts – more than a quarter of its workforce – and senior BA cabin crew face a % pay cut under a proposed new contract. IAG, which owns British Airways, claims it does not expect demand for air travel to recover before , while Gatwick Airport has said it could take up to four years. But Mr Strutton told MPs: I believe that airlines are exaggerating the problem. The predictions that some of the airline leaders are saying, of up to a five or six-year recovery, is not in line with industry standard predictions.  Last week, the International Air Transport Association – which is usually the touchstone for these things – issued its new projections and said that by the end of  we would be back to  levels. Weaposre in a trough at the moment, we will be coming out of it over the next two-and-a-half years, and I think that airlines are egging the pudding too much to take advantage of the crisis to make changes and downsize their workforce unnecessarily. Unite union assistant general secretary Diana Holland told the committee she was extremely concerned about the industryaposs future. She said: If there isnapost revenue coming in to the industry itaposs not just the airlines , itaposs the airports, itaposs everything down the line and of course all the people that work there. We are extremely worried about the future, and thataposs why we need to come together now to look at what plan we have to restart, to rebuild confidence and to make sure that jobs, pay terms and conditions – while there maybe temporary changes as we reach that point – arenapost decimated for the future.” Ms Holland admitted there may be temporary changes to jobs, pay, terms and conditions, but stressed they must not be decimated for the future. Conservative MP Chris Loder said Government support to BA was being used “as a buffer in order to allow them to progress considerable numbers of redundancies”. Labouraposs Sam Tarry said: “We see a parent company that has assets in the region of £billion, we see a company that has thousands of staff on furlough.” He accused the firm of using the crisis to “restructure the company”. Mr Tarry urged the Government to tell BA to “hand back the British flag because they donapost seem able to be supporting British jobs, able to represent our country globally”.  Committee chairman Huw Merriman accused BA of an “opportunist an underhand approach to their workforce”. Aviation Minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs Iaposve spoken with representatives at BA and obviously Iaposve expressed my disappointment. She added: I think the British public will make their own views on the actions of certain airlines. Ms Tolhurst admitted “any announcement around job losses or consultation round redundancies or terms and conditions is deeply worrying”. She insisted the threat of job losses keeps me awake at night. I am under no illusions to the impact and the concern that those iniduals will be feeling at that time, and what the consequences could be for some of them,” she said.

The experts branded the death toll in care homes a “scandal” and attacked the Government for failing to deal adequately with the first wave of Covid-. More than , people have signed a petition calling for an independent inquiry launched by campaign group March for Change. Ministers have not yet agreed to a public inquiry but have accepted that there will have to be a moment where they have to look back. At the No  briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: “Of course in any public health crisis there will be a time for lessons to be learned afterwards.” For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog HERE. But Justice Secretary Robert Buckland added: “It would be very dficult now to judge what happened in March, bearing in mind the change in our knowledge.” Labour leader Keir Starmer has said it was “inevitable” there would be an official inquiry but the party has not yet called for one.However, it has demanded a probe into Covid- deaths in care homes, saying staff and residents had been tragically let down. Dr Kailash Chand, former deputy chair of the BMA Council, said: “The UK is a world-leader in the fields of science and healthcare, and our NHS is the envy of the world. “Despite this, we now have the highest number of deaths in Europe and the situation in our care homes is nothing short of a scandal. “Governments and media from across the globe, from Australia to Germany, are using the UK as an example of how not to tackle the crisis.  “It is time that we, the public, hold this government to account by demanding an urgent and independent public inquiry.” His concerns were echoed by Professor Dame Anne Glover, President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh who said: “More than  in  of coronavirus deaths worldwide have been in the UK. The UK government has struggled to deliver an effective response. “Faced with the potential of a second wave this winter, compounded with seasonal flu, we now need an urgent and independent public inquiry to ensure we all learn the lessons while we still have time to prepare.” Professor Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added: “We clearly failed in the first wave and, with the possibility of a second wave come winter, we must make every effort to learn the lessons and be better prepared. “The public inquiry must be fast, independent and transparent to ensure we never again allow our NHS and care workers – and all key workers – to fight this battle without the adequate support and protection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fresh hope holidaymakers could take","story":"NewsBrits may be allowed to go on holidays in UK in early July, senior minister saysCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he would \"love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can\" -

Pubs, restaurants and hotels have remained closed since shutting their doors in March, with vast numbers of staff supported by the Governmentaposs furlough scheme. In the guidance, hospitality businesses claried that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach. The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request.  Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered.  It also proposed that customers are discouraged from ing empty glasses, customers are told to keep a safe distance away from bar staff and they will have to form a socially-distanced queue for orders. Tape on the floor showing the appropriate distance needed and customers collecting drinks from a pick up point are also among the measures suggested. Pubs will also have to put in place a plan for toilets to ensure they donapost become overcrowded.  Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UKH, said: UKH is working hard with our members and alongside other industry bodies to develop practical and effective guidelines to enable businesses to begin to reopen safely when the time is right. These are draft guidelines that have been shared with governments in England, Scotland and Wales, to help inform their thinking around reopening. We hope that the guidelines will help businesses draw up their own plans based on their premises, ensuring that safety is at the forefront of operations when the right time comes to reopen. It comes as pub bosses took advantage of a loophole in the easing of lockdown rules to serve scorched Brits as temperatures soared to C yesterday. Thirsty punters shared photos of themselves enjoying pints in disposable cups across social media on Wednesday as landlords re-opened their boozers for takeaways only. Bar staff were snapped bringing drinks outside in full PPE while one pub in Bournemouth saw huge snaking queues of delighted customers. This weekaposs mini-heatwave peaked yesterday - smashing the hottest day of the year record set on Tuesday - with many Brits more desperate than ever to enjoy a pint after weeks in lockdown.

The Prime Minister yesterday pledged to have a “world-beating” track-and-trace system for Covid- in place by the end of the month. We have repeatedly seen ministers make ambitious promises then fail to deliver on them - we hope this will not be the case with contact tracing. There is a substantial and essential dference between having a system in place by June  and it being fully operational. Ministers need to come clean on whether the programme will be up and running in all parts of the country by this deadline and whether the army of , tracers is sufficient. Track-and-tracing is key to containing the virus and allowing the further lting of the lockdown. Which is why it is all the more scandalous that it has only been resuscitated now after being abandoned on March . Once again we see the Government playing catch-up as a result of its earlier misjudgments.

A study of , adults found an average of  minutes a day was spent feeling under pressure or worried about things such as work, finances or health - pre-lockdown. But this has now risen to an hour and  minutes per day since the pandemic took hold as fears about money, job security, the economy and health grow. But the study, by wellbeing brand Healthspan, found that while -somethings now feel anxious for an hour and  minutes each day - an increase of  minutes - the over s have seen this figure almost double. Previously, they spent just  minutes a day worrying, but this has now risen to an hour and seven minutes. Fty-somethings have also gone from feeling anxious for  minutes a day to more than an hour-and-a-half now. It also emerged one in five adults - including % of those over  - believe they are experiencing anxiety for the first time ever as they adjust to a new normal. Worryingly, more than two thirds who are experiencing anxiety said this was manesting itself in physical symptoms. Dr Meg Arroll, a chartered psychologist working with Healthspan, said: For a long time, young people have been thought to be most likely to suffer from an increase in stress and anxiety as they find their way in the world, or juggle young families and work. But while they are still spending a large part of their day feeling anxious, those over  have seen the biggest jump in the time they spend suffering from stress and anxiety in recent weeks. There is a real worry about peopleaposs mental health as they adapt to a new normal - particularly for older people who may see more changes than most in the way they live their lives in the coming months, leading to feelings of isolation, vulnerability and helplessness.  The study also found % of adults admitted they have times where they feel constantly worried or anxious. Financial worries are the biggest cause of stress, followed by health issues, a lack of sleep and weight gain. A loved oneaposs health issues and safety, work and the economy are also among the most common concerns. Three quarters of those polled have even lost sleep due to their anxiety - an average of four hours-a-week.Others have experienced physical symptoms as a result of their stress, including headaches or migraines , stomach discomfortand palpitations .A loss of appetite , a dwindling libidoand even dizzinessare also among the symptoms suffered when feeling stressed or anxious. Sufferers have also made a mistake at work , cancelled a night outor rowed with a friend or family member . But almost four in  admitted to turning to food and comfort eating when they feel under pressure. And more than one in  have called in sick to work, % have argued with a partner and one in twenty have even seen it end a relationship. Dr Sarah Brewer, author aposCBD: The Essential Guide to Health and Wellnessapos, said: Many people are trying to find natural ways to relieve stress with products like CBDworking really well to help reduce anxiety.  With people struggling to sleep we are also seeing a growth in self-care products such as Healthspanaposs Magnesium Bath Flakes and sleep aids such as Valerian and HTP. It also emerged half of those polled, via OnePoll, feel they are more prone to anxiety as they get older. And unsurprisingly, % are feeling more stressed about their health at the moment. Coronavirus is the top health concern currently for % , along with mental health , weightand fitness levels .More than half are also feeling anxious about things aposing to normalapos after the lockdown. Dr Meg Arroll added: Itaposs no surprise that the top three reasons for heightened levels of stress cited in this survey are financial concerns, health anxieties and a preoccupation with not getting enough sleep as these worries are often intertwined.  Therefore, breaking these negative thought cycles is important not only for mental health, but for overall physical health and ing also. With so much going on at the moment, it can feel like all we do is worry. This type of negative identity can be damaging over time as we ignore the other positive coping traits we have. To combat this there are exercises here that can help to build a more positive self-identity, which in turn will help you turn the volume down on anxiety.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex, patron of Shooting Star Children’s Hospices, has been left “incredibly saddened” after it shut one of two sites dedicated to helping  seriously ill kids. The charity, which has been visited by other senior royals including Prince Charles and Camilla, and the Duchess of Cambridge, offers emergency respite and end-of-le care. But a Mirror probe has discovered it is one of dozens of hospices, which rely on the public’s generosity, facing unprecedented hardship. Mass cancellations of fundraising events such as the London Marathon and the closure of high street charity shops have fuelled the crisis. Karen Sugarman, vice president of SSCH, which supports children in London and Surrey, said: “Covid- has had a devastating effect, like being run over by a massive steamroller. “Nobody could have been prepared for this. We are fighting with everything we have to be there for people who need us in their darkest hour.” Shooting Star was awarded £, in emergency government funding last month, but with services costing £, a day, Karen says it has “merely papered over the cracks”. She added: “The Government has been slow to react and there hasn’t been an adequate response.  “Sadly I don’t think we have ever been high enough on their agenda. “Charities around the world are suffering. We all have dferent needs but we are in this together.” The Mirror has been campaigning for the Government to double its funding to hospices to end the postcode lottery of hospice care, recruit more palliative care doctors and community nurses, and guarantee all terminally ill children receive end-of-le care. The closed facility, in Hampton, South West London, was visited by the Countess in February just weeks before the lockdown. Its ten child bedrooms and six family flats, normally full, will remain empty until funding is found.  To raise awareness carers recorded a version of Miley Cyrus’ song The Climb, complete with sign language, which the singer plugged on Twitter. A Buckingham Palace source said the Countess “is closely following their situation and being kept regularly informed”. They added: “She was incredibly moved by a video they posted recently and she was incredibly sad to hear that they have had to close the Hampton hospice for now. “She is hugely passionate about the role they play in the children’s lives and she will continue to support them where she can in the coming months.”  The hospice has also been supported by music mogul Simon Cowell and Spandau Ballet frontman Tony Hadley, plus David Walliams. But with the situation desperate, Karen, who has been with the charity  years, raised £, this month by singing and playing the accordion live to her friends. She said: “I don’t play the accordion and I’m not a great singer but we are all doing what we can. “The Countess and our other supporters are with us as well and that means so much. We are in an unprecedented times and must raise money to keep the service going for children and families who rely on us.”  She added: “We are extremely thankful for the rescue package but, for us and many others, this is merely papering over the cracks. “People assume we are funded by the NHS but... we are wholly reliant on the generosity of others.” Charles and Camilla officially opened the Hampton centre in , before Camilla invited some of the children to Clarence House to help decorate the Christmas tree. In , Kate – who is patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices –also visited the charity at its former base in Middlesex.  As part of its emergency response to the pandemic, the Government promised £million in grants to support hospices. But insiders say it is not enough and the care and support needed by a quarter of a million people every year hangs in the balance. Pop star turned campaigner Hadley said: “We really rely on public and corporate donations, which sadly have decreased during the pandemic, as people face their own financial uncertainties. “I know this is a dficult time for many, but any money you can donate would be so appreciated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first mass graves could dug","story":"NewsPlan to dig mass graves in UK to hold coffins of hundreds of coronavirus victimsOfficials in Aberdeenshire are drawing up the proposals to deal with a spike in deaths due to the coronavirus crisis following a similar move made by authorities in the United StatesShareCommentsByRichard PercivalNeil Murphy:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video coronavirus-death-toll-rises--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news first-mass-graves-could-dug-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Aberdeenshire Council is considering making them capable of holding hundreds of coffins as part of measures to deal with the Covid-. The planning covers Scotlandaposs north east coast after local council bosses said cremation and burial services could be overwhelmed. Latest figures from National Records Scotland show that only  people have died in the region from coronavirus with , dying in Scotland. Philip McKay, head of roads, landscapes and waste services at the council, said at a virtual council meeting that initially the regionaposs funeral industry looked bleak from initial forecasts. Officials in New York City, US have already started stacking wooden coffins next to each other in deep trenches on Hart island. It comes after the city experienced more than , deaths from Covid- last month causing morgues across the city to become overwhelmed. Mr McKay said: As part of that modelling there were ideas similar to New Yorkaposs approach, that we may have to open what effectively would be strip lairs. It is an absolutely draconian measure and one we didnapost take lightly and one we hoped we will never have to put in place. We were also considering the preemptive opening of lairs, which means the lair would be open before we had notication of the requirement for it.  The mass graves would be dug discreetly as officials added that it wouldnapost be appropriate to be done with members of the public present. Cllr Peter Argyle, chairman of Aberdeenshire Councilaposs infrastructure and services committee , said in a statement: The service has prepared for the worst case scenario and hopefully that will never be needed - but we need measures and plans in place. Academics also suggested that mass graves could be introduceddeath and bereavement services are inundated with bodies from the Covid- crisis. The experts from the University of Huddersfield believed it would spark a major increase in mortality rates.  Coupled with staff absences, the researchers say that this would lead to struggles issuing death certicates, a bottleneck in funeral services and overfilled mortuaries. Dr Julia Meaton, Dr Anna Williams and researcher Helen-Marie Kruger, authors of the paper, said: The impact of such an increase from normal levels will mean that the authorities will struggle to maintain death registrations and disposals that will potentially have serious consequences. Practically, not being able to register a death or obtain a death certicate will mean that disposal cannot take place. The authors continued: There will be a bottleneck of burials and cremations, causing ceremonies to be delayed with mortuaries filled beyond capacity. Families will be prevented from closing bank accounts, pensions, selling property or receiving insurance, which could have financial implications. Smaller plots, which are ten yards long and two yards wide, were previously created at Kemnal Park Cemetery in Chislehurst, London for members of the Islamic community.

Eddie Tierney was  when he had the op in  – and surgeons warned him the organ may last only five years. But  years later he is still going strong and yesterday welcomed a new law which means everyone in England is assumed to be an organ donor, unless they opt out. Max and Keira’s Law is named after Max Johnson, , of Winsford, Cheshire, and his heart donor Keira Ball, nine, who died in a car accident near her home in Barnstaple, Devon, in . The Mirror campaigned for four years to bring it to the statute book. Eddie lives in Wales, where the opt-out system has been in place since . “It is a good idea as far I’m concerned,” said Eddie, who lives with his we Phyllis, , near Rhyl, Denbighshire. “It means there is more chance of people getting a heart transplant than there was when I had mine.” Eddie, a former cabinet maker who later ran a second-hand shop, fell ill with a flu virus which attacked his heart. “I went in with the flu and the next thing I was told I had six weeks to live,” he said.  After a spell in Glan Clwyd Hospital in nearby Bodelwyddan he received a transplant at Harefield Hospital in West London. The operation was performed by world famous surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub. Eddie said: “I was his rd heart ­transplant at Harefield. He told me when I had it done that I should get five years.” One of the young doctors who cared for him initially in North Wales later became the Tierney family’s local GP. Dr David Whyler phoned Eddie last week to say happy birthday. Eddie said: “He told me he could never believe that I would get to . I’m still here. To be still here  years on, it’s just remarkable. I just can’t believe it.” Eddie later discovered his heart donor was a -year-old woman. And although he never met her family, he said: “I’m so grateful to them.” He still enjoys road trips on his two motorcycles and added: “I’m looking forward to getting out on my bike when the lockdown ends.” Eddie, who has a son, Michael, a daughter, Debbie, four grandchildren and a three-month-old great-grandson, Caleb, had to scrap a birthday party planned last Friday.

McDonald’s said: “McDonald’s and its franchisees are working closely with local authorities and the police, and may determine it is necessary to close lanesqueues cause disruption at busier sites or put employees or customers at risk.” The giant aims to have all of its drive-throughs open by early June. Buses Bus operators First Bus, Stagecoach and Arriva have added extra services after limiting passenger numbers to % of capacity to help ensure social distancing.  First Bus said drivers will do a head count using a device on ticket machines, closing doors and setting off when % capacity is reached. Passengers who make it on will be asked to sit a safe distance apart. Dave Lynch, of parent company FirstGroup, said: “We have been working round the clock to find ways to innovate so we can ensure safe, socially distanced space.” Stagecoach and Arriva want commuters to wear masks and sit by a window on their own unless with a family member – and keep seats in front and behind free. Passengers paying with cash must have the exact fare, as drivers will not give change to reduce the risk of infection. The Confederation of Passenger Transport said it was keeping people up to date “on how they can play their part to keep the bus network safe”.

Roped off areas, restrictions on kids’ playgrounds and patrolled smoking areas are also on the cards.

Broadcasters have previously been banned from screening fixtures at that time amid fears fans would watch on TV rather than attend games. But matches are due to take place behind closed doors when the season resumes. Mr Dowden said: “I think that creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League, free-to-air.” He added: “Those discussions are ongoing.”  Mr Dowden also offered hope for UK staycations, saying he’d “love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can”. Mayorsapos plea for homeless Mayors have urged the Government to seize a “once in a generation” chance to tackle rough sleeping after the crisis. Labour leaders in Manchester, Liverpool, London, Sheffield and North Tyne want ministers to deliver a new funding package. During the pandemic more than , rough sleepers have been offered emergency digs.  But the initial funding package is due to run out within weeks and ministers say getting them in longer-term accommodation is up to skint local authorities. Councils say extra funding to tackle Covid- is too little. Labour leader Keir Starmer backed a joint statement by the mayors, which said: “When this crisis is over, we cannotto business as usual.” Boris boosts gongs hope Boris Johnson has given the clearest hint yet that he will back a medal for our NHS heroes. The PM said this year’s June honours announcement will be delayed to autumn so it can recognise the contribution of those fighting Covid-.

A poll of , adults saw the British staple of fried or grilled bacon sandwiched between two chunky slices of bread come out on top. Other popular fillings include cheese and pickle, chicken and bacon, and even a filling of crisps. The results show a sht in tastes, with a similar study from  seeing a plain cheese sandwich top the chart. This was followed by ham and cheese - which has now slipped to sixth place - with the nation favouring sausage, and egg mayonnaise two years on.  It also emerged that when it comes to preparing the perfect sandwich, aposwhite, medium sliced bread with the crusts left on and cut into squaresapos, is the top choice. A spokesman for Warburtons, which commissioned the  and  studies, said: However you prepare it, or whatever you fill it with, thereaposs something that canapost be beaten about a good old British sandwich. Itaposs interesting to see bacon top the list as weaposre all craving comforting, simple and hearty meals as social distancing continues. Itaposs also great to see Brits get more creative in the kitchen with jam and cheese, and even peanut butter and marmalade being used in the nationaposs sandwiches.  The combinations are endless so it comes as no surprise that bread is still one of the nationaposs favourite go-tos. The study also found itaposs not just sandwiches being enjoyed more by the nation, as a third of adults are eating more toasties now than they did before the lockdown, with cheese the most popular filling. And among the best loved condiments to enjoy with sandwiches were pickle , ketchupand mayonnaise . Others choose to spice up their sarnie with a splash of sriracha , a drop of tabascoor a spread of English mustard .  It also emerged almost half of those polled are eating more bread, while a third are enjoying more toast since the start of lockdown. The average person will enjoy four sandwiches and two toasties during a typical week - but a fth are currently tucking into more than seven sandwiches in a seven-day period. As a result, the average household is getting through two loaves of bread a week - with a quarter consuming more than three loaves in that time. Nearly a third Brits said the reason theyaposve had more bread is because they arenapost buying as many meals away from home, and  per cent put it down to having lots of other food in the house which goes well with it. Lunch is still the most popular time to enjoy a sarnie or toastie with  per cent doing so, while a quarter of Brits frequently indulge by snacking on a sandwich.  More than a third actually prefer sandwiches for lunch over a hot meal, and  per cent would even struggle to go a day without enjoying a slice of bread. However, people are no longer creatures of habit as  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, try to alternate their sandwich fillings, and one in  have been more experimental with fillings during lockdown. Some of the strange and unusual creations put together by the UK were also revealed with one respondent admitting to enjoying a chocolate spread and salami sandwich. Another confessed to eating a chocolate biscuit sandwich, with corned beef and peanut butter also among the inventive combinations.

However, when le s to something that looks a little more like normality, things could be far from normal when it comes to heading out on an evening. Drinking at the bar could become a thing of the past, so could mingling in crowds or even sitting near other diners, reports the Manchester Evening News. Last week, the Prime Minister revealed the governmentaposs plan in easing the strict restrictions, including when hospitality businesses can re-open. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here This is currently earmarked for no earlier than July  - but this completely depends on the five tests set out by the government being met which includes a consistent drop in Covid- cases. The ban of people drinking at the bar is one of many proposals being considered aimed at helping hospitality firms reopen. Restrictions on the number of children in outdoor playing areas and patrols of smoking areas have also been put forward among potential measures touted to help sites meet coronavirus guidelines. In the guidance, hospitality businesses have made it clear that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach.  The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request. Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered. It also proposed that customers are discouraged from ing empty glasses, customers are told to keep a safe distance away from bar staff and they will have to form a socially-distanced queue for orders.

Zoology student Lucy Patterson began feeling short of breath after a home workout, but put it down to the intense exercise. The University of Liverpool undergraduate had no underlying health conditions and thought she was low risk. But after collapsing eight days later on April , she called her GP who told her to call an ambulance. Lucy had developed pneumonia in % of her lungs and spent eight days on a ventilator at Liverpool University Hospital. The student from Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, revealed her story to student news site The Tab. She said: It just felt like my lungs were tiny. It felt like I was really conscious of the amount of oxygen I was getting in and breathing out. I initially thought, aposoh, this has been a really tough workout, Iaposve overdone it, Iaposve overdone the squats.apos Like most people doing lockdown, Iaposve been so bored that Iaposve just done exercise every day - before, I was a bit more sporadic. Theyaposd been going fine and I was really enjoying them. It was only when the shortness of breath started that I realised something was wrong, because it was the exact same workout that had been fine every day before.  But it took me hours of lying down on the sofa before I was fit enough to go upstairs again. It started feeling like I was a bit more out of breath doing things, so I didnapost take it to be that serious - I just thought maybe I was having a slow day. But as the days went on, it just felt like my lungs got smaller and smaller. Lucy had stayed with her housemates in Smithson, Liverpool to avoid spreading the virus to her parents back home. She had to tell her parents Helen Patterson,  and Michael Patterson, , about the seriousness of her condition over Facetime. She said: Before I was also in the aposuni canapost be over yetapos mentality and wanted to stay on with my flatmates and try and make lockdown fun - ironic.  It must have been very scary for my parents - I called them pretty much every day and they were just getting snippets of how I was progressing, whereas I was seeing it continuously. They saw me deteriorating with every call. I was so blase about it, so my family were much more concerned about me than I was. Lucy spent eight days on a ventilator, but admitted it wasnapost as scary as she had imagined. She now regrets not going to hospital sooner. I was definitely a part of that group before that was really blase about it. I do a science subject, so Iaposd seen the statistics for young people.  I was like, aposthe likelihood of me getting this, let alone it affecting me in any way is so small - I donapost need to worry.apos But when youaposre lying in that hospital bed, you donapost knowyouaposre going to be that .% thataposs going to be unlucky. I wasnapost improving for about five days, so it could have gone the other way for me. Everyone deserves help - just because someone is worse off than you, doesnapost mean that you need to save a hospital bed. If youaposre sick, youaposre helping the doctors more by going in early and getting checked, rather than trying to wait it out in your bed and then getting to the point youaposre so sick an ambulance has to come pick you up.

Prof John Wright, head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research at Bradford Royal Infirmary , said there were  new cases six days after the VE Day anniversary on May . Up until that point, the number of cases at the hospital had been reducing, with only three reported on Monday May . But three days later, on Thursday May , the number of cases shot up to  - a figure Prof Wright suspects has come from VE parties that ended in fist fights or embraces. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   Writing in a diary for the BBC, the professor said: Itaposs just one figure, and in normal times we might discount it as random iation. However these are times of alertness, and every flicker of the Covid dashboard needle triggers nervous anticipation of a possible spike. There is a delay between infection and symptoms, usually about five-to-seven days.  So these cases would have been incubating since the week before - and possibly since the communal gatherings on VE Day, six days earlier. VE Day - the th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe in World War Two - would have been marked in a huge way at any other time. But in this current climate, communities did what they could within lockdown limitations.

And I was very flat, at first.She added that despite her mum not wanting her to have the procedure, she went ahead with it anyway. But things did not go according to plan. Shilpa explained: I chose my doctor based on what I later discovered to be fake reviews. That first surgery was botched, and I had complications immediately after the procedure. I was short of breath, and felt a sharp pain in my leg. Unable to contact the Miami-based doctor directly, Shilpa did a little investigating and uncovered a culture of deception in the cosmetic surgery trade. His office staff members had bribed every patient in the office with free [pain relieving] Arnica cream for their fake review. The only reason I’m telling my story now is because I don’t want anybody  to go through what Iaposve been through. I wish I had never picked him as my first doctor. Shilpa is furious with the people who had written the  testimony. She said: People don’t care about other people as long as they get what they want from writing their fake review.  The end result of that surgery was not only a lopsided rear end, but considerable discomfort. It was very painful, and I wasn’t able to sit on my butt for four months. Now, following three more expensive and aposaggressively painfulapos corrective procedures costing a total of k – for which she travelled to Colombia twice and had to undergo a aposJ-plasmaapos to reattach loose skin back onto her muscles – Shilpa is finally able put this painful experience behind her.

The killer virus, which has claimed more than , lives around the world, is believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan late last year. But the Chinese government claims huge strides have been made in battling the disease, and le is slowly going back to normal in the epicentre.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here  It is now allowed to operate at % of its previous capacity. People have to book in advance and have their temperatures taken before they enter. It comes after authorities in Wuhan said they have already screened more than half of its population - including doing half a million tests in a single day this week. Figures released by the Wuhan Health Commission yesterday showed that , nucleic acid tests had been carried out the previous day. Just  new cases - of people who were not showing symptoms - were identied. The city is aiming to have tested every person by May . Described as a apos-day battleapos, the mass testing initiative started on May  - with the central municipal government ordering all  of its districts to come up with their own way to test every resident within its borders. Parks and public squares are being used as assembly points and makesht swabbing stations. Each Covid- test takes about three minutes, while the procedure is free to the public, officials said.  Health officials in Hubei Province in Central China say more than half of Wuhanaposs population has been tested so far, though, according to local media reports, some three million residents had also been tested during lockdown. While it is not mandatory for members of the public to take part in the testing campaign, officials have described it as a responsibility.  The tests are mainly targeting the elderly and children, who would not have been tested in large numbers during lockdown. Wuhan officials believe mass testing is the only way to ensure the safe reopening of schools and businesses. But they remain cautious and have refused to rule out the possibility of a secondary outbreak.

I’ve had space to go and run and cycle, do some things in the yard and touch a ball every day.“It’s been good to have certain resources back home and to keep doing stuff.”Like most, lockdown has been a test for Harkes’ mentally and physically. For him, it’s a challenge he soon hopes to rise to on the pitch.Harkes added: “It’s definitely been a challenge on both sides but, thankfully, the club provided us with a great fitness programme before we went on furlough to keep us ticking over.“I’ve been active and all of us want to be flying when we finally get the go-ahead to get back to playing.“We’re all trying to push each other and push ourselves.“On the mental side, the way we ended was a little tough because we wanted to play for the fans and finish out the season.“We really felt like we deserved the title and we knew it then but we just wanted to finish off the games and prove it to everyone.“We’ll have that desire to get back on the pitch and play hard when we finally get it going.”The United support have taken to Harkes since he joined the club in January last year, as much for his flowing locks as his skill on the pitch.He is pleased to inform them nothing has changed on the hair front in lockdown but that he might soon be forced to take matters into his own hands.“I’m still going strong but it will be cut before everything gets going again,” Harkes said.“I think it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.“I don’t want to start putting it up in a bun and everything.

However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

qualification","story":"Aberdeen captain Joe Lewis praised the achievement of securing European qualication for a seventh straight season, but admits he has no idea what format the Europa League will take.The decision to end the Premiership campaign with eight rounds of games remaining confirmed fourth placed Aberdeen’s Europa League qualication.However, with the vast majority of European nations still in shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty remains over when the Dons’ Europa League campaign will start and what the format will be.At an executive committee meeting scheduled for May  UEFA were expected to set out the plan for completing this season#s Champions League and Europa League.European football’s governing body were also expected to deliver a blueprint for next season’s Euro competitions.That executive committee meeting has been postponed until June .The three options reportedly being considered by UEFA are to play the qualying rounds, which Aberdeen would be involved in, as planned or as a one-leg basis at a neutral venue.Another option is to scrap some,not all of the earlier pre-qualying rounds, but  UEFA have stated it is not planning on depriving clubs of the chance to progress through games, but they may be left with no choice.Lewis said: “It is a great achievement for the club.“It is pleasing that we have Europe from fourth place.“We want to keep kicking forward and to improve next season.“I don’t know how the European competition will work with the travelling for the qualiers.“We are in it and how they structure it and get the games on is not our problem at the moment.”Aberdeen have traditionally started in the Europa League pre-qualiers in July but that will not happen this year.UEFA plan to have the   Champions League and Europa League completed in August, having given European top flights enough time to finish their campaigns suspended by Covid-.In a time of uncertainty over when domestic and European action will start for Aberdeen, the SPFL board at least delivered some clarity by ending the Premiership campaign earlier this week.SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan recently confirmed everything #humanely possible# must be done to secure ato action by the end of July.However, Scottish Government clinical director Professor Jason Leitch insists that time frame is too soon.Lewis said: “It’s our close season now, we have been given our programmes so the lads have to do them ourselves.“Hopefully we will come back before too long, there are a few dates.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity.

the real reason why its aircraft have been seen across Scotland.The most noticeable planes to have been spotted recently launched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.These large aircraft have been observed circling Glasgow as well as making brief landings during \"touch and go\" manoeuvres designed to practice these tricky and sometimes risky touchdowns.In wartime, some planes have to make landings on rough terrain, so its imperative that pilots are as well-practised as possible.\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent

become more aware and interested in these activities.\"To be clear, these were all occurring prior to the pandemic. But a lack of civil aviation now makes them stand out more.\"Many of the larger aircraft based out of RAF Brize Norton, such as the C- Hercules, AM Atlas, A-MRTT Voyager, and C- Globemaster regularly fly on essential, but routine training missions around the United Kingdom.\"The C- and A in particular fly quite low-level profiles, and on operations they will be used to land in areas where there are not established runway surfaces.\"This can include landing on beaches, for example.\"The quiet skies have made it easier to spot military planes, which can sometimes be identied and followed using apps like FlightRadar.Occasionally, the military planes have been observed performing strange-looking manoeuvres such as flying around in circles .The RAF said these odd flight patterns have a clear explanation: the aircraft were involved in mid-air refuelling.For the last three weeks RAF Lossiemouth has been involved in night flying exercise which concluded on Friday, May  involving Typhoon jets.\"During our night flying window, we launched our first set of sorties around ,\" the spokesman added.\"This meant we were able to generate two or three training serials a day ndash two in daylight, and one in low-light conditions.\"The Typhoon is a multi-role aircraft, which means itrsquos able to conduct a number of dferent missions while in the air air-to-air and air-to-ground manoeuvres to name two.\"To enable our Typhoons to stay on task for longer and travel larger distances, we are often supported by Voyagers ndash the RAFrsquos air-to-air refuelling aircraft based at RAF Brize Norton.\"These Voyager aircraft will fly lsquoracetracks in the skyrsquo, and are usually visible on flight tracking websites which pick up ADS-B.\"In the United Kingdom, live-armed Typhoons are on \"constant standby to react against unidentied aircraft approaching UK airspace as well as aircraft that are operating in an unusual manner, which may pose a threat\".Typhoons are often scrambled on \"Quick Reaction Alert\" missions to intercept planes which enter British airspace\"Our last intercept was against two Bear-F ndash Russian Maritime Patrol Aircraft on April ,\" the spokesman said.\"Additionally the Typhoon Force are involved in NATO Air Policing missions, such as Op AZOTIZE in Lithuania where  Squadron deployed a few weeks ago.\"Typhoons have also been involved in strikes against Daesh.\"A Typhoon jetIf youre worried by the sudden appearance of a military aeroplane, you can generally find out what its up to by visiting offical Twitter accounts or the RAF website.\"The RAF has always been open about its operations and exercises,\" the spokesman continued.\"With the public now spending more time at home, many have taken to their gardens or spent more time on their phones.\"They have also become more acutely aware of the noises above their houses, and wersquove seen a signicant increase in interest in routine, but essential flying as a result.\"When we do launch Quick Reaction Alert, wherever possible we publish information as to who we intercepted, what the aircraft were doing, why the interception was carried out, roughly where it all happened, and we aim to answer as many questions we can whilst maintaining operational security.\"Itrsquos vital that the public understand why this activity is essential to the defence of the

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

All three surely deserve awards ndash and maybe a letimersquos supply of Bonios ndash for their service to the nation during the pandemic.The unconditional love given freely by dogs, and their unembarrassed reliance upon our reciprocation, is quite overwhelming in its purity. It can be a lesaver, too. Don has talked publicly about his struggles with depression over the years, reiterating how his dogs helped him through the darkest times. Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others.

They believe this will allow the creative energies of the people, ground down by the nine to five, to be released.New ideas will flourish. Voluntary work will become the norm. Wersquoll all become poets and musicians. Only worthwhile jobs will remain because no one need do any work they donrsquot want to do ndash like empty bins or sell stuff.It is a pleasant fantasy, and taken seriously by many visionaries, including tech billionaires like Facebookrsquos Mark Zuckerberg and Teslarsquos Elon Musk, who wonder what is going to be done with all the surplus people once everything is automated.Nicola Sturgeon is an advocate of UBI and has more or less promised it in an independent Scotland. There are trials under way in Scottish councils.Most fans of UBI regard themselves as being on the left, like Barack Obama and Yanis Varoufakis. However, the idea has a long history on the right.The famous Alaskan scheme, the Permanent Fund Dividend , was introduced by a Republican Governor, Jay Hammond, in . The recently-completed UBI experiment in Finland was initiated by a right-wing government which included the True Finns in .Now, Irsquom not playing the Twitter game here of guilt by association. An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage. But there is a logic here:peoplersquos incomes are determined exclusively by the state, politics will become about the level of that distribution.Imagine a system in which everyone receives pound, a year, as proposed by the Reform Scotland think tank. Leave aside the increase in taxes required to pay for it. Rich or poor old or young, you get the same chunk of change from HM Government.First off, this is not enough to live on and is the same as the current level of Universal Credit, currently pound a week. It is a mystery to me why this is seen as a boon to humankind. A whole raft of means-tested benefits would have to be added on top, like housing benefit, disability benefit and child benefit.UBI advocates say: well, itrsquos only a start. Anyway, people can top it up with a job. But think of what happens at election time Along comes the Real Income Party of Fiscal Fortitudeled by a charismatic populist who says, like Dunleavy in Alaska: ldquoThis isnrsquot a universal income itrsquos universal poverty. Vote for me and Irsquoll double it.Since taxes will already be sky high to pay for UBI phase one, he or she will promise to pay by making the state more ldquoefficient. Get rid of bureaucrats. Cut waste. End subsidies. Get rid of immigrants trying to grab our money.This populist aspect of UBI hasnrsquot been considered because most of the existing UBI experiments are not UBI. In Finland, , long-term unemployed were given euro a month for two years subject to a means test. The results were indferent, though most of the recipients said they felt better. But this was not UBI, which is meant to be given to everyone, working or not.Spain is about to introduce another non-UBI. The Socialist-Podemos government is planning a non-contributory cash payment of around euro, a month restricted to families who fall out of the existing means-tested social safety net.Neither the Spanish nor the Finnish scheme is inidual, unconditional or universal, the three key criteria for UBI. Politicians hailing these schemes, like Labourrsquos Rebecca Long-Bailey, appear to be unaware of this.Other schemes exist in the developing world. The biggest, in Kenya covering , villagers and paid for by the US charity GiveDirectly, has been under way since . It has been praised for not constituting a disincentive to work. But since the UBI there is only  dollars a month, that is perhaps not surprising.Any UBI worth the name in a country like the UK would have to be set at something close to average wages. Otherwise, what is the point  I simply donrsquot see the sense in offering people a UBI at the same poverty level as Universal Credit.And to give a living UBI to everyone, wealthy included, and then tax everyone massively to pay for it, seems to be a perverse form of redistribution.UBI is addressing a serious issue. Think tanks claim that automation will kill a third of all routine jobs. Capitalism doesnrsquot need big workforces any more because it has evolved beyond industrialisation.But UBI is not the way. The benefits of automation should be spread by taxation, shorter hours and higher pay, not by creating a society of serfs living on a miserable stipend.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed.

for their treatment to be restarted.He said:ldquoThis is extremely welcoming news and will provide much needed comfort and reassurance to worried patients across Scotland.ldquoThe Scottish Government wants to reassure patients that we are working with the four IVFcentres, alongside the leading patient stakeholder group Fertility Network, to ensure all services resume in a safe and timely way.ldquoI also want to reassure those women who are close to the upper age limit for NHS IVF, that they will not be disadvantaged and subject to a clinical assessment, they will still continue to receive treatment.ldquoScotland has the most generous and fairest NHS IVF treatment in theUKand we want to ensure clinics are able to contact patients as quickly as we can safely do so.Chief executive of thefertilitynetwork,Gwenda Burns added:ldquoThis has been an extremely dficult and distressing time forpatientsand we welcome the news that clinics have approval to resume services by the HFEA.ldquoWe are working closely with clinics and the Scottish Government to ensure that treatment can start as soon as possible while providing a safe service to patients with all the necessary precautions in place.Speaking after the news was revealed, Ms Davidson said: \"This announcement to re-open all four of Scotlands NHS IVF centres is a welcome one for all patients where treatment was suspended and all those waiting nervously for help to start a family.\"While IVF is a physical procedure, it is utterly consuming both mentally and emotionally and I know from the sheer number of patients who contacted me, just how dficult the uncertainty of this time has been for those whose treatment was interrupted.\"For the patients concerned, I hope todays announcement heralds a post-Covid mini baby boom.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-sensors-track-changes-lockdown-walks","story":"Scots are flocking to beauty spots near houses and staying away from areas that would typically be popular, according to results from a national footfall experiment.Environmental technology company Wilderness Sensors placed internetconnected counters at locations including paths not far from its headquarters in Stewarton, East Ayrshire, and a number of Historic Environment Scotlandunmanned properties.Among them was a section of the Antonine Wall near Bonnybridge, near Falkirk.The technology is designed to provide information on levels of use and demand, and help communities plan services for visitors.But it has also shone a light on striking shts in leisure habits since the start of the pandemic.Before lockdown, the counter in Stewarton picked up an average of about  people per day taking in a local river stroll.The same device has since detected a four-fold increase in walkers, with up to  each day.Similarly, sensors at the Antonine Wall have registered a steady increase in visits following the introduction of Covid- travel restrictions and amid concern over health risks posed by crowded places.In January and February, they picked up around , people, rising to nearly , in March.However, by April, the figure had jumped to ,, with the figure for May projected to be more than ,.The surge has prompted HES experts to stress that monitoring visitor pressure at some sites will be of crucial importance during lockdown.Alistair Carty, technical director at Wilderness Sensors, said: ldquoWe have had a counter on the Stewarton river walk for a long time, counting the number of people who take a walk along the river.ldquoNormally, it picks up a few dozen people every day ndash but we have seen a real usage pattern sht.ldquoStewarton is a commuter town and, as a result of lockdown, there are probably a lot of people who are re-discovering what their local area has to offer, making the walk part of their daily routine.Mr Carty said data changes at the Antonine Wall ndash a turf fortication built by the Romans across what later became Scotlandrsquos Central Belt ndash were also dramatic.ldquoThe counters... are part of an ongoing programme of deployments across Historic Environment Scotlandrsquos unmanned sites, he said.ldquoThey are designed to help the organisation understand how these places are being used and where interventions may be required ndash for example,there are a lot of visitors at the site, a member of staff might need to be there too.ldquoThe Antonine Wall site at Rough Castle is a big open space, so it can handle the increasing number of people walking there while social distancing guidelines are in place.ldquoInterestingly, footfall has become more pronounced at the weekend, rather than evenly spread across the week.ldquoWe interpret that as the reduced numbers of professional dog walkers that would use the site on weekdays.ldquoBut, overall, the site is considerably busier and now follows a more traditional lsquovisitorrsquo pattern.ldquoInevitably, there is an element of seasonality to the numbers but that only explains part of it.ldquoThe change in visitors has been stark and the fact it is not only the weekends shows lockdown has had a signicant effect on peoplersquos habits.ldquoIt is making people look to their local area and heritage sites, perhaps re-discovering these places or taking them in for the first time.However, the trend, while indicating broad levels of compliance with Scotlandrsquos coronavirus restrictions, is likely to create challenges given the possible impact on historic locations.Nick Thomas, head of commercial performance  systems at HES, said: ldquoMonitoring our unstaffed properties will be of particular importance during this current period of restricted movement and beyond.ldquoWith visitors likely to favour less populated and open sites in the coming months we will need to be aware of the potential pressures that this generates.ldquoThe Wilderness Sensors are an important tool in this remote monitoring process across our erse estate.Counters have also been deployed on the West Highland Way in partnership with Stirling Council, Gartness Community Group and CENSIS ndash Scotlandrsquos centre of excellence for sensor and imaging systems, and the Internet of Things .Although the devices have only just been installed, they are expected to show relatively low footfall compared to what would normally be anticipated at this time of year, in a sign that many people are avoiding popular visitor sites.The initiative follows a recent FutureTech seminar held by CENSIS at Loch Lomond and The Trossachs Country Park headquarters in Balloch.This was part of a wider programme of business support commissioned by the Scottish Government to explore the use of IoT, which refers to the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive information.Rachael Wakefield, business development manager at CENSIS, said: ldquoOne of the main aims of the [West Highland Way] project is to provide a boost to the local economy, by helping businesses plan ahead for staffing, stock, and opening hours using visitor data.ldquoHowever, the outbreak of Covid- and the subsequent lockdown has brought an unexpected element, in which we are observing just how quiet the route is in late spring ndash normally one of the most popular times of the year to attempt the walk.ldquoAlongside the footfall counters, we plan to install other sensor systems to monitor iables such as weather conditions and river levels, and so we still expect to see some interesting data from this stage of the project.ldquoIt is a great example of how sensors and IoT technologies can be used to better understand how visitors are interacting with Scotlandrsquos heritage and help local businesses, which depend on tourists, to more efficiently plan.Evidence that increasing numbers of people in Scotland are being drawn to sites and landmarks close to their homes comes as ministers prepare for an expected surge in staycations once lockdown is eased.Last week, Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ldquoWith the unlikely event of aviation as we knew it resuming soon or possibly even by next spring, staycations, I think, will be extremely popular.ldquoWe have to consider and we have to manage the foreseeable scenario where the first weekend, the road from east Loch Lomond, from Drymen to Ben Lomond, is jam-packed because everybody goes to the most popular area. We have to think about that as well, and these practical issues ndash the provision of public toilets and lavatories and other services ndash all these things we need to plan in advance."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11393521.jpg?type=article-full","title":"world-health-organisation-updates-list-coronavirus-symptoms","story":"The World Health Organisation said that the most common symptoms of the disease are ldquofever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath feeling generally unwell and some aches and pains.Other symptoms linked to the virus include headache and a loss of taste or smell, it added.And gastrointestinal issues including nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea appear to be affecting -% of patients, it added.On Monday, the UK chief medical officers updated the list of key symptoms for Covid-.Officials said that as well as a fever and a new continuous cough, anyone who develops a loss of taste or smell should also self-isolate for seven days.And those who live with them should isolate for  days.WHO said that its Covid- clinical network ndash a group of specialists treating patients on the ground throughout the world ndash will be shortly updating its clinical guidance, hopefully by the end of the week.At present, the most common symptoms listed on the WHOrsquos website include: fever dry cough and tiredness.Less common symptoms listed include: aches and pains sore throat diarrhoea conjunctivitis headache loss of taste or smell a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.But during the tri-weekly press briefing in Geneva, the WHOrsquos Covid- technical lead Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said: ldquoThis is still a virus that wersquore learning about, and wersquore learning every day about this virus.ldquoWe have our clinical network ndash a global group of medical professionals that are dealing with patients directly [who have] first-hand knowledge of dealing with patients.ldquoAnd this clinical network was set up in early January, specically to put people in touch with one another, just say lsquowhat are you seeing rsquo lsquoWhat are the patients presenting with  lsquoHow are they progressing to severe disease or not rsquo.ldquoTheyrsquore having these teleconferences at least once a week.ldquoAnd we will have new clinical guidance -an update to our clinical guidance ndash which will come out hopefully by Friday of this week, in the coming days.ldquoThe most common symptoms of people with Covid- are fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling generally unwell ndash some aches and pains.ldquoBut we do have some non-specic symptoms that people have reported including headache.ldquoSome of them have gastrointestinal symptoms ndash between - % of patients have reported some kind of either nausea or vomiting or diarrhoea.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality. We are also prioritising projects that will deliver local economic benefit within our communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: .."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

Three children’s charities were chosen to vote for by families, and the winning one was Young Minds, a charity that supports children and young people’s mental health.Donations were made through Just Giving.Mairi MacKenzie, a teacher at the school, said: “It was great that so many of the pupils took part, and it was brilliant to see them interact during lockdown.“It is important for us, as staff, to keep the school reunited, even though we cannot be together in person.“We are, of course, also delighted to be raising money for a very worthy charity during what is a very challenging time for many.”The quiz was also shared with other children in the community, where they were given an opportunity to download the quiz, and also donate to Young Minds.To date, the fundraising effort is over £.The teachers already have plans in place for another virtual event in the coming weeks.Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s annual end of term cèilidh was held online last Friday for the first time ever and was extremely well received with almost , viewers watching the Facebook live event.The event brings the academic year to an end and gives both students and staff the opportunity to come together at the college for a night of music, dancing and entertainment.Comann nan Oileanach decided to put together the Cèilidh Mhòr online via Zoom with a ceilidh thereafter on Facebook live, hosted by Iain Smith fromTrail West.The event on Zoom included music from SMO students, Micheal Steele and Saffron Hanvidge, a cocktail masterclass and, for the first time, CnO’s Student Awards which commended iniduals on ious achievements, teaching and SMO community work.As part of the evening, CnO decided to raise money for the Skye charity – Skye Community Response – this year and the total sum at present is £.A new free online tuition service is being launched by arts organisation Fèisean nan Gàidheal.A video series of traditional music lessons, at dferent levels, has been created in Gaelic and English to support those with no Gaelic, learners of the language and fluent Gaelic speakers.The ‘Oide’series currently offers lessons in accordion, fiddle and Gaelic song, with more instruments available soon, thanks to further funding from the Scottish Government.The lessons, which are suitable for all ages and abilities, are led by some of the most experienced traditional music tutors in the country, including accordionist Ian Smith from popular folk band, Trail West, fiddler Robbie Grieg, who plays with electronic folk band, INYAL, and singers James Graham, Eilidh Cormackand Deirdre Graham..The project comes under the banner of FèisTV, with funding from Bòrd na Gàidhlig, Creative Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise,Kate Forbes MSP has welcomed almost  extra weekly collection slots for Tesco supermarket orders for constituents living on the Isle of Skye.The constituency MSP had been approached by several constituents on the island who are in the shielding category but had been unable to book a collection slot for weeks in advance.Some feared they would have to break self-isolation to go to the local shops for essential supplies.Following constructive discussions with Tesco officials, most notably the Dingwall store management who are responsible for all Skye and Lochalsh deliveries, an extra two vans were added to serve this route.The extra slots began earlier this month.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3111585.jpg--.jpg?1588926951000\n","title":"make some connections","story":"BALLYMENA financial adviser, Vincent Rainey has always loved a good quiz.So, when COVID reared its ugly head, Vincent put on his thinking cap and came up with a thoroughly modern method of reaching out to the thousands of quiz afficianados out there in cyber land.Thanks to Facebook and digitial technology, Vincent’s quizzes ‘from his kitchen table’ have become a huge local and global hit with social media users.They gather eagerly for a regular helping of fun, facts and fantastic craic with quizzes usually held at pm on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings.Vincent has kindly sent us some of his favourite quiz questions for use in print.On with the show:-Make the connection..

Fiadh was born on the very day Altnagelvin hospital introduced restrictions on visiting, which came a few days before Derry went into full lockdown.It meant both Saoirse#s family, as well as her husband Niall, missed out on meeting Fiadh, who is a sister to Sean.Just over a month later, when Niamh and her partner, Peter, welcomed Reuben - a brother to Elsie - to the world, the Costello family once again were deprived of meeting the latest addition to their clan.Taking advantage of the easing of the lockdown restrictions, the sisters met up in Saoirse#s back garden for a much anticipated cup of coffee and a chat - and, of course, a proper look at the new arrivals.Saoirse said: It is so good to have Niamh here and to actually see my new nephew in front of me is amazing, but I want to hold him so much and that#s hard.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFriends Jenner Ferguson, Charlene Dempsey, Rose McCann and baby Emma McCann meet for the first time in two months for a picnic in Cranmore Park, Belfast, yesterdayPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFriends Jenner Ferguson, Charlene Dempsey, Rose McCann and baby Emma McCann meet for the first time in two months for a picnic in Cranmore Park, Belfast, yesterdayWe chat every day, we have been sending each other videos and photographs, but nothing is a good as the real thing.Reuben looks so beautul - all the pictures in the world don#t do him justice. I cannot get over how much hair he has and I am looking over at him and wonderingI can see similarities between him and Fiadh, but really all I want to do is hold him and cuddle him and tell him I am his auntie Saoirse.It has been so dficult being shut away from Niamh, our parents, our other sister and brothers - but not being able to share the births of our new babies properly with each other has been especially tough.Before our babies were born, we talked about how good it was going to be to both be on maternity leave at the same time - how we could take our babies for walks to the park along with our other two children, go for coffee and call up to our parents# house - but none of that has been possible. We have kept to the Government#s guidelines because obviously we realise how important it is that everyone does everything they can to keep people safe and I am so, so happy that the lockdown has been lted enough to allow us to meet up outside, even though we still have to keep to the rules on social distance.For the past  weeks, it has felt as though we live at opposite ends of the world, even though we are just around the corner from each other, but for now, we are enjoying this.Niamh said: It is incredible to see Fiadh, evenshe is six feet away and I am so happy that Saoirse can see Reuben. This is a day we have both waited so long for. Fiadh is so long, her hair is so dark and she has the most beautul big blue eyes, but I feel the same as Saoirse, I want to hold her. The timing of the births of Fiadh and Reuben could not have been worse because no one has been able to meet them properly.We still can#t go to our parents# house because our mother works in a care home and that is the toughest thing for both of us.It is just natural that when you have a new baby, you want their granny and granda to see them, but our parents have only seen Fiadh and Reuben through the windows of our houses.She added: My mother and father just dote on their grandchildren, they love it when we all congregate there, so not being able to see and hold these two new arrivals I know is really dficult for both of them.All we can do is hope the situation with coronavirus doesn#t get any worse, so we can all get together.

Credit:Steve Parsons PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA person on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app, which Isle of Wight residents have been trialling. Credit:Steve Parsons PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA contact tracing programme involving all confirmed positive cases of Covid- has started in Northern Ireland.The region has become the first of the four devolved nations to launch the plan, with all new positive cases now being traced.Finding all the people someone has been in contact with once they have tested positive for Covid- is seen as a key part in preventing the spread of the disease, according to the Public Health Agency .“This is another example of the herculean work right across the HSC system to fight back against Covid- and keep people safe,” said Health Minister Robin Swann.“The battle against the virus is a long-term challenge and contact tracing will have a very important role as part of that.”Dr Jackie Hyland, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said contact tracing at this stage involves new ways of working given the scale and the fact that new evidence is continually emerging about the illness.“We have teamed up with colleagues in the university sector and Health and Social Care Trusts to put in place all the necessary logistics,” he said.“We are now rolling out contact tracing further and working with the public to support people who may have been exposed so they can get tested and self-isolate to help prevent spread of infection.“We are progressing our plans for scaling up the second phase of the Northern Ireland contact tracing service, informed by the learning from the current pilot programme. This work involves testing all aspects of the programme.“From May  we have been undertaking contact tracing for all confirmed positive cases of Covid-.“Testing is also now available to everyone in Northern Ireland aged over five with symptoms, which will form an important part of the contact tracing programme.“The number of staff currently required changes each day in line with workload, but we have sufficient staff trained and available to manage contact tracing and meet demand.”The Department of Health is also taking forward work around digital solutions that can support the wider contact tracing programme when it goes live.The land border with the Republic of Ireland is an important factor in the spread of infectious diseases and therefore contact tracing.There are well-established systems in place to work with colleagues in the Republic on contact tracing and management of infectious diseases, and the health service is working at pace to develop new, more efficient ways of working collaboratively to reduce the spread of Covid-, and help protect cross-border travellers.For now contact tracing is being carried out exclusively by telephone and in a similar manner to the method used at beginning of the pandemic.“Our very first case was an inidual who landed in Dublin Airport then travelled to Northern Ireland back to their home and we saw the Public Health Agency and the Health Service Executive actually working together to do that contact tracing, so we’re taking that approach to begin with,” the Health Minister said.Mr Swann said he had spoken to his counterpart in the Republic, Simon Harris, on Tuesday morning regarding the development of a contact tracing app and he was also monitoring progress on digital technology within the NHS.“We’re still looking to see which will be the best fit for Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that two apps could be used in Northern Ireland until a bespoke app could be created.He had previously said that his preference would be for a single app which would work across the British Isles, butdferent apps were used they would be compatible.Contact tracing was suspended in Northern Ireland in mid-March. A pilot programme resumed on April  and Mr Swann said he expected the contact tracing service to be in place “for the next year at a minimum”.The Executive, guided by health experts, now believes the focus on contact tracing can help limit any impact of a second wave of Covid-.On Tuesday evening, a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing response to coronavirus on both sides of the border took place between Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, the First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the two health ministers.In a joint statement, Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis said they discussed the respective plans for emerging from lockdown “given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible and strong collaborative arrangements”.“Strong data-sharing arrangements North South would be a necessary part of the easing of restrictions,” they said.What is contact tracing Contact tracing aims to identy and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus.The process starts with someone who has been tested positive for Covid- being asked to list all the people they’ve recently been in prolonged contact with.A contact tracing team member will then phone these contacts and talk to them about their risk of infection. Everyone who has the infection and who is a close contact will have to self-isolate. To be successful in contact tracing people need to provide their phone number when they get a test.Why is it important Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lt restrictions in other countries, like South Korea, when combined with stringent testing measures.The most important element is speed.The five-stage process — sampling, testing, communication to a positive case, contact tracing and contact quarantine — all needs to be done in a -hour window to be effective in preventing spread.Why was it halted Contact tracing was halted by the UK government on March , though that proved to be a controversial move as many experts believed it was key to slowing the spread of the virus. The government was subsequently accused of not having the capacity to run it effectively.On April  the Department of Health in Northern Ireland restarted an ‘enhanced contact tracing pilot’, which, it says, is now operating five days a week. It’s felt by the Executive that it could prove crucial in limiting the impact of any second wave of coronavirus.That service is set to be expanded to operate over seven days soon.How does it operate in Northern Ireland For now, Northern Ireland is relying on telephone contact, but the speed of the process should increase dramaticallya mobile phone app becomes available.The process is off to a slow start and on May  the Health Minister said  staff were trained and working on contact tracing. On that date there were said to be  more tracers in training with a further  volunteers having come forward to join the list.In April Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride had said he estimated  to  staff would be needed for contact tracing to work efficiently.Is a contact tracing app likely to be used The development of an app to speed up the process of contact tracing is seen as key to maximising the impact of the scheme, but that has raised questions over whether Northern Ireland should be involved with the UK or on an all-Ireland basis.At the moment the UK and Irish governments are working on separate apps, but Health Minister Robin Swann said no decision has yet been made on the best way to proceed.The app would be able to identy people the patient may not know — like fellow passengers they have been in contact with on public transport or in supermarkets.But there have been concerns about privacy, particularly in Northern Ireland where security workers who may be reluctant to use it over fears their personal details could be compromised.Should contact tracing be organised on an all-Ireland basis Addressing media earlier this week, the Health Minister insisted there needed to be “a clarity of message”.And while a single app that works across both the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be the best solution for Northern Ireland, the logistics of that are proving problematic. Northern Ireland might have to settle for a compromise,it can be agreed, that would see UK app compatible with one in the Republic, arranged as part of the memorandum of understanding between authorities north and south of the border.Since Ireland is one geographical area, andcontact tracing is to be a long term project, then it makes sense to have an all-island approach.Is this likely to be a long term project The NI Executive has maintained that contact tracing is a crucial component for ending the lockdown, and that wider surveillance of the virus in the community is necessary.The system is expected to be in place for at least a year, possibly longer.

I started feeling very unwell at her funeral. I was coughing and coughing. A few days later I couldn#t move. I was so exhausted, I was totally wiped out and had to sleep all the time. The fatigue was like nothing I#ve ever had before, it was unreal. I would go for a shower and have to lie down afterwards. It took so much out of me Janet HetheringtonI couldn#t stop coughing. I tried every single cough medicine but nothing would help this hacking cough. I couldn#t sleep for coughing and that just added to the exhaustion. I was ill for about six weeks, right until the end of February. Every time I thought I was coming around, it would hit me again. I couldn#t taste anything and I wasn#t interested in food at all.The fatigue was like nothing I#ve ever had before, it was unreal. I would go for a shower and have to lie down afterwards. It took so much out of me. It was a horrendous experience. I went to the doctor and he said that there was something awful going around. I#m in a choir and I had been talking to some of the other members who said that there were a lot of people complaining about the same symptoms. One of the ladies said that it took seven weeks for her to recover.North Belfast IT consultant Vivian Fergusonis convinced he had the virus before Christmas. I started a new job in the first week of December, he says. In the second week of December I developed a headache and lost my sense of taste and smell. I went completely off food. The pain in my head got far worse over the next few days. It was a crazy pain that paracetamol wouldn#t even budge. I also had a bad dry cough.I remember getting a fever. I just had to stay in bed. Throughout it all the headache didn#t go away at all. It stayed strong. I was in bed for around six days, completely floored. It was only after that time that my headache shted. It took weeks for the cough to go away. Half of my office was also sick with the same symptoms.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseVivian Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappVivian FergusonI have had nothing like that ever before. The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

He was a good man and everything he did he did for us Mikee PlangcaIt came as such a shock, his -year-old daughter Mikee told the Irish Independent.Dad had been sick for about a week in the house, with a cough and what he thought was a cold and then he ended up in ICU. He spent  days there before he died. It#s very hard for us to take it all in at the minute.Together with her siblings Michael , Johnand Chekie , Mikee is now an orphan.I#m concentrating on minding my brothers and sisters for now, she said.We don#t know what will happen. We would like to stay in Ireland because that#s where we have made a le, where our friends are and our [Filipino] community is, but we don#t know.The Plangca children first arrived in Ireland four years ago. Until then, they had lived their lives in the Philippines, where their only contact with their father was through video calls and twice-yearly visits.Their half-sister Stephanie, a daughter Miguel had from a previous relationship, was living in Abu Dhabi.My father made a decision many years ago to come here to provide for us, said Mikee. holds a photograph of her father Miguel who was a factory worker and lost his le to Covid-, leaving Mikee and her  siblings orphans.

Picture by Frank McGrathHe left so we could stay in the Philippines and have a better quality of le. Every month he sent money home to us.We were like many other families in the Philippines who had a parent in another country working to provide.Then when my mother died, we came here to Ireland to live with him.After completing sixth year at school in Prosperous, Co Kildare, Mikee opted out of going to college.Instead, she applied to be a full-time carer for her brother Michael, who has intellectual disabilities.My brother is my responsibility, said Mikee.When we first came to Ireland, Dad was working day shts but he switched to night shts so that I could go to school. He looked after Michael during the day and worked at night.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us.Meanwhile, Miguel#s sister Fely had followed in her brother#s footsteps by moving to Ireland herself in .She later married an Irish man and settled in Naas, where she works as a childminder.I was working in the Philippines, not earning a lot of money and my brother encouraged me to come here, she said. I met an Irish man and got married and I made a le here too.When Gilceria died and the children came here Miguel was finding it dficult to cope on his own and he talked about moving back to the Philippines. I said no, you can do this, so they moved in.My husband said to bring them in to live with us and that#s where they were living when this all happened.After Miguel fell ill with Covid-, Fely also contracted the virus.We were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong Miguel#s sister, Fely Miguel was hospitalised on April  and Fely joined him in Naas General hospital six days later. When Miguel#s children were tested, Mikee and Michael were found to be Covid positive.Michael and I had no symptoms, said Mikee. We self-isolated in the house for a month. We were too scared to go out.Fely was discharged on April , but her brother#s condition worsened.My mother and siblings would call him every night at six o#clock, she said.They would talk to him in his hospital bed and we were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong.Last year, the Green Isle pizza manufacturing site in Naas where Miguel worked was bought over by Birdseye.Colleagues remember him as a kind and gentle colleague. When he became ill, the Filipino community stepped in to look after his young family.We had to try to help out as best we could, said Aina Conway, president of the Kildare Filipino Community.They have recovered but they have lost their father and they are in shock. I speak to Mikee most days and she has cried every day since her father was brought in to ICU. At the moment she is just trying to be strong for the little ones.Together with the Philippine consulate, the Kildare Filipino Community are raising money in aid of the Plangca children.They have their aunt, but Mikee has been the mum for a long time, said Aina.Now that they have lost their father, they need all the support we can give them. Miguel came here to provide a better le for his children. You look at the kids now and that#s them forever, with no parents. It#s incredibly sad.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were asked to attend the meeting using video conferencing software after the cancellation of meetings during April and March. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said it was important that the council were in a position to adapt to the circumstances of the pandemic. She said: “It is vital that democratic accountability and protection for ratepayers continues during the pandemic. “This is a crucial period for our ratepayers, families, businesses, employees and they will be depending on council to continue to provide service delivery and assist our community to get through this crisis. googletag.cmd.push “Council meetings are a vital part of that and I would expect them and other meetings to be held online now for the foreseeable future.” While there were some minor technical issues, the meeting mostly passed off successfully and there is hope that the public and press will be able to attend future meetings. Cllr McGurk said: “I would hope that this will ensure future meetings will be even more open and transparent. “This may even encourage greater access with members of the public who would never normally have attended a council meeting able to view meetings online from the comfort of their home. googletag.cmd.push “This can only be a good thing for democracy and allow the public a greater insight into the workings of decision-making bodies. “Tuesday’s online meeting of council is proof that we can adapt to work around some of the problems presented by coronavirus. “This crisis has pushed all sections of society to find technological solutions to the way we work and I firmly believe that the lessons learned from this will have a long term impact on how we continue to work after the pandemic has passed.” Details of future meetings to be held remotely will be published on the council’s website.

The move means the decision will be revisited by the council after unionist councillors initially blocked a Sinn Feacutein motion on the issue. Cllr Leanne Peacock topping up the wages was the right thing to do. When the furlough scheme was introduced there was an appeal from government for employers to top up the full wages of their employees by adding the additional %, she said.

Trade Unions had not been meaningfully consulted prior to this decision and discussions with council on the furlough of staff are still ongoing.” googletag.cmd.push “We are disappointed that the full information was not available to elected members prior to the decision been taken and potential agreement with Trade Unions had not been fully explored- we felt given these facts that it was essential to ‘call-in’ the decision.

TheNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject has  members across Derry and Strabane who have formed ayouthcouncil and are currently putting together a manesto for change. The cross border and cross community project is for young people aged  to  and allows them to be the voice for the young people in theNorthWest. It normally includes residential and activity based work, study visits, local workshops, confidence building and skills development. However, these were all cancelled due to the lockdown. Project Manager of theNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject , Barry Fennell, decided to use video conferencing technology to allow the group to continue to come together and share ideas. googletag.cmd.push TheTheNorthWestMinistry ofYouthhas successfully managed to harness the new technology to continue their work and has now set up a series of sub committees to look at employability, learning, health, sport and the environment. As the project progresses the group will put together a youth manesto which will lay out the changes they would like to see in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. Mr Fennell said the group have adapted remarkably well to the changes in their circumstances. They have been brilliant in terms of their ability to continue and they are very switchedon. We are still having our weekly meetings through Zoom and that allows us to keep those connections at this time and try and continue with this project as well. googletag.cmd.push Co-chair of the group Plunkett Roarty, who is in Year  at Lumen Christi College, said video conferencing is the next best thing to meeting face to face. Due to the coronaviruscrisis we have had to use resources such as Zoom to stay in contact and come together to share ideas and tackle the key issues, he said. Plunkett is part of the Department for Health and Well-being which is tackling issues such as mental health and positive body image. At the minute we are at the discussion stage aboutplans and initiatives to tackle that, he explained. Video conferencing is a useful tool and we are still able to get a lot done. The members of the group are also enjoying the chance to socialise online. With school being off and all my sports training being cancelled the Zoom meetings area chance to meet up and see familiar faces who are facing the same issues as you, said Plunkett.North West Ministry of Youth – Youth Voices Project is delivered by Co-operation Ireland and Education Authority. This opportunity is funded by the EU’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body. Match-funding has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

After being inspired by Mary K Burkes photo of her son Damian in action for Lavey against Greenlough last season, she decided to paint this masterpiece, which called‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’. googletag.cmd.push I took some photographs of our clubhouse and top pitch to help with the overall composition. I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days. The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield the rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan, my grandchildren, who are under-age players and keen fans.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other vital health professionals locally, we can signicantly bolster our health service, especially at a time when it is under extreme strain. Mr McFadden said that the necessary work was done to ensure that the first students can start at the medical school next year. “Everything must now be done to ensure the school is open and ready for its first intake of students in September . googletag.cmd.push The Covid- emergency has highlighted the importance of our health service. Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them.

Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

If grammar schools as a whole disappear, however, then NI will become like England: selection will be based on wealth, not on any semblance of merit.Academic selection, for all its imperfections, is vastly preferable to a wealth based system. The ruling class in the UK is now dominated by ex public school pupils, because of the disastrous consequences of abolishing grammar schools.Yet the campaign to dismantle NI’s grammars is relentless, evenoften below the radar. Any attempt to move to teacher assessment, for example, could lead to major iations in standards and so to injustices for unfairly assessed pupils. It would be one day be followed by a demand that all selection is abolished, which would be a huge and retrograde step.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

So far the campaign has raised £,, but another £, is required to start this vital research. CdLS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a developmental gene. Children with the condition often deteriorate once they hit puberty, which results in severe depression and anxiety, mutism and self-damaging behaviours. There is currently no cure for CdLS, so Chris and his we Hengameh, who have two other children, Amir, , and Navid, , have been desperately trying to raise funds to develop a gene therapy treatment that could help Hasti and hundreds of others like her across the world.Mr Brannigan, who is working to support the NHS in planning the delivery of personal protection equipmentand mobile Covid- testing centres, said his family has been under ‘colossal pressure’ over the last few weeks.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Vouchers for free school meals are being issued to all who qualy every two weeks.Older shielding residents: For those without support from family and friends, the council has set up a Crisis Support Team to help with access to shopping, medication, and urgent temporary assistance. See the lsquoProtecting Vulnerable Peoplersquo section of the dedicated coronavirus page on the website www.valeofglamorgan.gov.ukBusinesses: There is a regularly-updated Business section on the councilrsquos coronavirus page, which should be the first point of call for all local businesses looking for assistance. Over pound million has already been distributed, and yoursquore encouraged to apply for support as soon as possible.Council staff: Staff are helping however they can some from non-essential services are doing waste collections, others are providing care. Itrsquos making a huge dference, and a recruitment drive for temporary care staff has also been a success.Volunteering: Local people are stepping up, and the Vale is supporting them via its Vale Heroes page on the website.Council tax bills: If you are worried about paying your council tax, get in touch with the department. They will look at every case inidually.Finally, in other news, Irsquom delighted to be taking on the role of joint Shadow Foreign and Commonwealth Office and International Development Minister covering Africa, in the new Shadow frontbench team announced by UK Labour Leader Keir Starmer. Irsquove done a lot of work in this area both during and before my time as an MP, and Irsquom looking forward to the role immensely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Theyrsquore not going to read or theyrsquore not going to learn anythingtheyrsquore traumatised by being in a very unusual situation. vw,vw,px, px\"Staff at the Coastline fish and chip shop and ice cream parlour on Blyth beach, Northumberland wearing PPE ndash Should school staff be given Personal Protective Equipment  Dr Tildesley said it might make a dference, but the evidence is not necessarily strong enough yet to suggest that should be advised for all teachers.Prof Woolhouse said: ldquoIf you take the extreme view that children really donrsquot pass on this infection very much, itrsquos probably more important for the teachers to wear PPE and stop them spreading it to children, rather than the other way around.ldquoI would argue the teachers need more protecting than the children.ndash Is there an educational argument for sending Reception and Year  children back to school in June Dr Wenham said she cannot understand the motivation behind starting with the youngest pupils.She told PA: ldquoYou can think well we begin with socialisation and language development and reading all these things are developed at a very early stage.ldquoBut is a month going to make that much dference.She said it would be better for children in Years ,  or  toto make the transition into the next academic year easier, and that those in Years ,  and  were missing out on the rite of passage of leaving school.Dr Wenham added: ldquoThe summer holidays are looming, so it seems a massive health risk for very little educational gain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What do the experts say about schools reopening  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

COVID- emergency funding for local councils.By The NewsroomTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"This morningCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, informed the Assembly that the Executive had agreed to provide a total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam

A poundmillion rates relief package for business sectors hit hardest by the Covid- lockdown was announced by the Finance Minister Conor Murphy today. Building on the poundmillion scheme announced in March which gave all businesses a threemonth rates holiday, the new scheme will result in businesses in the following sectors being relieved of the obligation to pay rates for the full financial year up to  March : * hospitality, tourism and leisure* retail * childcare* Belfast City, Belfast International and City of Derry Airports. All businesses will also receive a one-month extension of the rates holiday up to  July . Minister Murphy confirmed: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economy. The initial rates support package helped businesses with immediate cash-flow dficulties during the lockdown. As the Executive begins to ease the restrictions which have been necessary to save lives, I am pleased to announce this new scheme which importantly provides all businesses with an extended rates holiday for July. “Further support is then targeted at the sectors which will be in greatest need in the months ahead. This includes retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare and airports. This rates package, which is aligned with the Executive’s pathway to recovery, brings the total support for businesses from rates relief and grants to almost poundmillion.” Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the Executive’s approval of an income scheme to support substitute teachers who are unable to access secure work during the Covid- shutdown of schools. With many schools closed during the pandemic except those supervising vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers, eligible substitute teachers, who were engaged between  January  to  March , will have access to an income for the period April to June . An additional income through this scheme will top up their income to at least % of that earned in the period. Minister Weir acknowledged: “I am fully aware of the signicant impact this pandemic has had on our pupils, teaching and non-teaching staff. The issue of funding for substitute teachers, who are unable to work and therefore unable to be paid, is one that and I, and my Department, have been working hard to resolve. Today, I am pleased to announce that we will be introducing an income support scheme for substitute teachers through the Covid- Response fund. The estimated total cost of the scheme is around poundmillion. My Department will allocate up to poundmillion and the Executive has agreed to fund the remaining poundmillion. I would also like to thank the Finance Minister for his support in this matter. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced the Executive had allocated an additional poundmillion to support the most vulnerable people in housing during the Covid- emergency. The Supporting People Programme provides housing support for approximately , vulnerable iniduals living independently including: homeless people, older people, young people, and people with physical disabilities, learning disabilities and mental health issues. The additional funds will help maintain Supporting People services, which are commissioned by the Housing Executive and delivered through the public and voluntary and community sectors. Minister Hargey explained: “The additional funding will be used to address signicant staff shortages in the immediate term and mounting pressure in this area,the number of Covid- cases continues to increase. The money will fund overtime costs for existing staff and the use of the bank or agency staffing that is necessaryservices are to be maintained. Extra cleaning is also required, and the matter of a sufficient and adequate supply of PPE is being addressed.  “These are unusual times which demand actions and solutions. This funding allocation represents our commitment to the vulnerable people in Supporting People schemes, and the staff providing support to them. We support them and we are working hard to ensure their safety and wellbeing.” The allocation was also welcomed by Health Minister Robin Swann who added: “It is well recognised that supported living services better enable people to live to their full potential and reduce the need for acute health and social care services. Their value in society cannot be underestimated. “Officials across both departments are in regular communication to identy and address Covid- priorities across our Supporting People schemes. As a result my Department has now extended Covid- testing to all staff and residents of Supporting People schemes as well as providing a temporary supply of Personal Protective Equipment.” It was revealed by Minister Hargey that local councils will also be given pound.million to alleviate financial pressures as a result of the Covid- restrictions. The funding will ensure councils can continue to provide essential services and support those in need. Minister Hargey said: “Despite the current Covid- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in delivering essential services such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemetery services. The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring our health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities. “This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time but will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.” The Minister previously announced that councils here are eligible to apply to furlough staff through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This will help ensure that the rights of workers are respected and jobs are protected. This scheme along with this additional funding are supporting councils through this period.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbbcddebcad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbbeddffefcfbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
