He said it is ‘grossly irresponsible for anybody to spread scare stories and social media firms should have a zero-tolerance approach’.Professor Sonia Saxena, of Imperial College London, said the policy ‘risks disenfranchising parents and carers’ as well as ‘a rise in unvaccinated children being excluded from school – which could carry stigma for children whose parents do not comply’.Universities have been told they must play a role in identifying and inoculating students who are in danger.For the first time, Public Health England has estimated the number of young adults left unvaccinated after the MMR scare of the early 2000s as 248,586.Many parents refused to have their children vaccinated after British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield claimed in 1998 that it could cause autism.Even though his findings were shown to be wrong and he was struck off, his claims led to the anti-vaxxer movement of those who believed vaccination was harmful.Many children who were not immunised are now at university. Dr Mark Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, told The Times: ‘We know concerns were higher among parents and vaccine coverage decreased at the time Wakefield was in the media.‘These children are today’s teenagers and young adults and, although most parents are now much more confident, the children may not have been offered another chance to be vaccinated.’Senior health officials have identified the ‘Wakefield cohort’ as children who missed the jab between 1998 and 2005 and will still be susceptible to measles. A further 365,000 under 14 are also thought to be unvaccinated. Uptake of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab fell for the fourth year running in the UK last year, when there were 966 cases of measles in England – an increase on 259 cases in 2017.Dr Ramsay added: ‘Any group missing out on vaccines leaves them and others vulnerable to serious or even fatal infections. Teenagers are a greater concern because they mix with more iniduals.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Mural hijab clad Jacinda Ardern hugging Muslim woman Christchurch massacre","story":"Share this article          New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, sympathised with those who lost loved ones in the Christchurch massacre (pictured)Others believe the money could have been spent better elsewhere with people taking to social media to express their views.\u0027$11,000 can go towards actual people, help the homeless and the hungry... not a mural..\u0027 one person commented on a Facebook post.\u0027All I am seeing is a lot of money being put into the wrong things, it should be helping people, and the earth..\u0027 another person commented.          Many believed the money for the mural should have been spent elsewhere Others believed the New Zealand Prime Minister deserved the mural due to the healing role she played after the March 15 attack when Australian Brenton Tarrant allegedly killed 51 people and livestreamed his actions online.  \u0027This is a real leader with compassion and respect for all and the courage to lead, there is no better role model for world leaders today.\u0027 one woman commented on a Twitter post.           \u0027There is no better role model for world leaders today\u0027 many commented praising Ms Ardern during the tragedyThe image has been projected on many famous landmarks throughout the world, including an image shown in Dubai, across the world\u0027s tallest building.The mural was approved by the local council and is expected to be completed by May 30.

The Bakkers’ Praise the Lord (PTL) ministry raked in tens of millions of dollars.         ‘The charisma, the persuasion, the unabashed entertainment the ability of television in America to successfully deliver religion right into the homes of the nation,’ Elton John saidAnd the Lord told the couple to spend it lavishly, on themselves.The Bakkers revelled in the trappings of tasteless opulence. They had a gold-plated bathroom, a 50ft walk-in clothes closet a private jet his-and-hers Rolls-Royces, and an air-conditioned kennel (the pair even threw a wedding ceremony for Tammy’s Yorkshire terrier and poodle).For Jim’s birthday in 1987, Tammy Faye announced, on their show, that she was buying him a pair of giraffes.David Furnish, Elton’s husband, worked with Joseph Smith, who runs the couple’s Rocket Stage ision of their Rocket Entertainment empire, to put on a reading in London of the Tammy Faye musical.         For Jim’s birthday in 1987, Tammy Faye announced, on their show, that she was buying him a pair of giraffes. They are pictured together in 1989Smith noted that a full workshop will be staged later in the year, and that they’re working towards a production opening in London in the second part of 2020.He stressed that the show is ‘not a lampoon of religion’. Martin Koch, the celebrated orchestrator and music supervisor, oversaw the reading.He worked with Elton and Stephen Daldry on Working Title’s musical Billy Elliot. A director will be contracted soon. Elton was at the Cannes Film Festival for last night’s world premiere (out of competition) of Rocketman, director Dexter Fletcher’s terrific big screen musical that explores Elton’s demons and the dark side of showbiz.The film, from producer Matthew Vaughn, stars Taron Egerton (sublime) as the singer with Richard Madden as John Reid, Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin and Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton’s mum Sheila.There’s a lot of faith in Tammy Faye, who died in 2007, at the moment.Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield will portray the Bakkers in a film that will shoot this year. "},{"url":null,"title":"Home Secretary Sajid Javid compares childhood Margaret Thatchers","story":"Share this article Mr Javid, 49, told an audience at the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank: \u0027My story and Margaret Thatcher\u0027s story, that link to small business, is of course a story for countless people, millions of people throughout our country.\u0027The minister, whose father worked as a bus driver after coming to Britain from Pakistan, added: \u0027What I haven\u0027t said much is the reason that my dad was a bus driver was he wanted to get a job that could just give him enough savings so that he could do what was burning away in his heart – which was to start his own business.\u0027He did manage to do that after a few years, when he started with market stalls, selling ladies\u0027 clothing.               Mr Javid, 49, told an audience at the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank: \u0027My story and Margaret Thatcher\u0027s story, that link to small business, is of course a story for countless people, millions of people throughout our country\u0027And then he managed to buy a shop, which me and my mother and the whole family lived above.\u0027I remember selling the blouses, the tights, the skirts... you could say I know more about ladies\u0027 clothing than any other male MP.\u0027A new report by the Centre for Policy Studies found six in ten small company owners do not feel supported by the Government.Responding to the study, Mr Javid said yesterday: \u0027Whilst small businesses are paying their fair share of tax, they see tech businesses pay a piddling share of tax if anything at all.

My wife felt it would be very beneficial that I have another dog in my life. She knew that it would help me get through things with my father.\u0027Jo was attracted to the breed because of its huge size and good nature.He said: \u0027What drew me to the breed was having the best of both worlds, a protection dog that I didn\u0027t worry about hurting my kids or having that unpredictability.         Guards: The three pooches are used as \u0027protection dogs\u0027 by the family, but dad Joe says that he is confident they are well mannered and always behave around his two sons\u0027I\u0027m very prone to large breed dogs because they fit me, I am a big person and they fit my lifestyle. I like to see the muscles in them because working them is something I really enjoy doing.\u0027They are extremely predictable and they fit in as a part of the family as well as a protection dog. I do not worry about anybody coming I leave my doors open and I am not worried at all.         \u0027They are extremely predictable and they fit in as a part of the family as well as a protection dog,\u0027 said Joe\u0027They are very smart and confident, and a confident animal does not need to bite or do things like that. They don\u0027t have anything to prove.\u0027As Joe\u0027s relationship developed with Ringo, the family decided to begin breeding them, and added to their family.He explained: \u0027Originally we were only going to have Ringo but then we started this studding stuff.\u0027Ringo then fathered both Harrison and Paul.Joe said: \u0027My largest boy is Harrison. He is 27 months old and 250 real solid working-dog, everyday-fit pounds. Ringo is 218 pounds, he is the sire of both Paul and Harrison. Paul is right around 170 pounds and he is ten months old.\u0027My wife came up with the theme of the Beatles. Ringo and Harrison\u0027s relationship is so similar to me and my dad\u0027s that it\u0027s almost scary. Ringo reminds me a great deal of my dad, his demeanour, temperament.\u0027And I guess I feel like I was a lot like Harry when I was younger, too. And their bond is so evident in all of them really.\u0027If I had to classify them as sports iniduals, Ringo would be a boxer, Harrison would be a wrestler and Paul would be the basketball player.\u0027         Joe Thompson with Paul, the youngest of the three dogs, when he was a puppy              \u0027If I had to classify them as sports iniduals, Ringo would be a boxer, Harrison would be a wrestler,\u0027 says JoeJoe\u0027s dogs have become a huge hit with both his kids and the family\u0027s friends.He said: \u0027My two sons really love their boys. That gives them a lot of - for lack of a better term - bragging rights with friends.\u0027A lot of their friends like to come and see them. It\u0027s a great icebreaker for them and they\u0027re very active in helping me work these dogs because - let\u0027s face it - kids have a lot more energy than us older parents.\u0027So I use them to my advantage as much as they can and they really, really love their doggies.\u0027         I Want You (But he\u0027s so heavy!): One of the three pooches goes in for a friendly snuggle with Joe but forgets how much he weighsThe three giant mastiffs not only keep Joe and his family company but they are also in huge demand as stud dogs around the world.Joe said: \u0027My boys, the fur-Beatles are some of the most wanted studs on the planet. They are wanted overseas. \u0027My stud fee for Harrison is $3000, for Ringo it is $2500, and Paul is undecided it really depends on how much he is wanted. You know fawn is usually the most desirable colour. So I\u0027m thinking Paul will be around $3000.\u0027         Sweet Little Sixteen (stone!): Oldest dog Ringo now weighs in at 218 lbs, which is more than the average human Joe regularly walks his dogs in the woods surrounding his house, and they even swim in the heavy current of the river.He said: \u0027One of our main exercises is retracing steps me and my father had done all of our life. We\u0027ve had a hunting shack up in the woods which has been there since 1947, I believe. And that\u0027s a place I like to go and stay with my dogs quite a bit, sometimes for a week to work them, get photos, bond with them, train them. \u0027The upstream swimming is amazing to see because you or I or any human being, an Olympic swimmer couldn\u0027t hold ground in these kind of current and these guys actually slowly gain ground.\u0027The giant dogs have even had some close calls with the local wildlife.Joe said: \u0027On several occasions when we are out in the field running with nature it is inevitable. It happens, but nature is self-governing and doesn\u0027t allow animals to get into fights or get hurt so generally speaking they avoid us.\u0027But on occasion we will run into bears or bobcats. Several years ago I happened to catch on video Ringo treed a bear and I actually called him off.\u0027Joe doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027d do without his three monster mastiffs, and can\u0027t imagine having any other breed.He said: \u0027I love them more than you could ever really say in words. And they\u0027re unlike any breed of dog that I\u0027ve ever had experience with. The feeling of being away from home and reunited is real similar to your own kids. You miss them when you\u0027re gone, or when you have a bad day at work it\u0027s nice to come home and have real genuine love that\u0027s not conditional in any way.\u0027They will love you no matter what kind of mood you\u0027re in.

Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Fine Gael’s two Dublin candidates for the European elections, Frances Fitzgerald and Mark Durkan, canvassing at St Stephen’s Green Luas stop in Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The If being an MEP for Dublin means something it’s lost on most voters.With barely a week to go until polling in the European elections, The  discovered a shockingly low level of engagement and candidate recognition among the constituency’s electorate.You would think Dublin would be easier for voters to identify with than the other, sprawling Euro constituencies where random counties are just thrown together in a way that gives no sense of place or belonging. “I will fight for the people of Midlands North West.” Indeed.But it’s not as simple as that. There may not be a big geographical distance from Rathcoole in west Dublin to Donnybrook on the southside, or Artane on the northside, but in their own way they are as different as Donegal is from Cork or Kildare.On a sunny day this week, The  spoke to candidates as they canvassed across the city, most in safe places which would provide rich pickings for votes.For example, Fine Gael front-runner Frances Fitzgerald’s canvass was in Donnybrook that of Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews in Artane that of Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan in Mulhuddart, where her party has polled well in the past.Two big issues stood out from discussions on the streets: housing and climate change. You could see all candidates have triangulated on green issues. It was clear too from speaking to voters that these elections are failing to excite. “I have not thought about it” was the most common reaction followed by “I don’t know much about it.” It was surprising, too, how often people conflated local election candidates with the European ones.But certainly for the candidates and for the parties, there are clear lines of demarcations. The centrist and centre-left parties present it as a battle against Eurosceptics and populists.“The European project is at risk in terms of populism and nationalism from both the left and the right. I’m absolutely pro-European,” says Fitzgerald.But the parties and candidates of the left, who will take at least one seat here, argue they are not against the European project at all.“We are still Euro-critical and proud to say that. We are not nodding dogs, we are watchdogs,” says Boylan.She acknowledges some people say “we shifted our position on the EU because we backed the Remain vote” but “there is nobody who can say that Brexit was good for the island of Ireland”.Similarly Clare Daly rejects the eurosceptic tag: “I love the travelling, I love the euro, I love the free movement. The fact there are different cultures here - my daughter studies abroad - that’s what people mean when they are pro European.“They don’t say they are pro the austerity policies, the gutting of public services, the commodification of public services, and the military industrial complex which is particularly concerning for Irish people.”Daly is the disrupter in the race. She came in late and hasn’t done posters on lamp-posts, going instead for billboards and ads on the side of buses that you’d expect to see for the opening of a new blockbuster, complete with catchy slogan “Daly is Different”.Rathcoole might be the fastest growing village in Dublin but today it’s as taciturn as the time when all there was here was the thatched tavern and the quaint courthouse for “petty sessions”. This is far outside her own patch but Daly is getting some recognition from the odd shopper, or parent picking up young children.People were surprised that she opted for Europe, given her impact in the Dáil: “It’s a genuine scary concern about he future of Europe, that’s why I have taken the plunge. Pesco (the EU defence cooperation strategy) was a game changer on that,” she says.So what’s her stance? Is she a supporter of what’s called leftexit? “That’s too simplistic. The narrative is bigger than that. There has been an overestimation of the benefits of leaving and an underestimation of the benefits of staying.“The reality is more complex. We need maximum cooperation. I am a believer in the ideals of the EU… Peace, equality, internationalism, solidarity, all of that good stuff. But that’s not the EU that is there now. Unless it changes tack and drops the neoliberalism, that’s the root cause of the trouble we have.”She says people told her before entering the Dáil she would make no difference and believes she can also prove the doubters wrong in Brussels. Referring to herself and Mick Wallace, who is standing in South, she says: “We are, if anything else, different and maybe use the platform in a more creative way than others have as well as being incredibly diligent legislators.”On a crowded junction near the canal at Baggot Street, Green Party candidate Ciaran Cuffe tries to interest passing office workers in his party’s policy. There are bits of engagement, mostly they take leaflets. When you talk to voters here and elsewhere, climate change is often first mentioned.Cuffe, a councillor and former TD, is understated and policy-oriented. He rejects the suggestion that Green policies are unrealistic. “A lot of the solutions are a good news story. We can get rid of fuel poverty. If you are stuck in traffic every day and then move to safe cycling lanes, that is also good news. That’s where the government need to be.”What are his chances? “As the frog said, it is never easy being green and you have to compete for every vote. In a party like the Greens you are down in the margins of error and get your message and appeal to a wider audience.”Another of those who will be in the margin of error like him is Alex White of Labour, who is out meeting walkers on Sandymount Strand in early afternoon. The party is above 10 per cent in Dublin, according to polls, but he is a little bit behind.“There are definitely signs that people are looking at us again. We have retained a loyal core vote and they have stuck with us, and others are also coming to us,” he says.Like other candidates, White identifies housing as the “issue on everybody’s lips” and argues it could be an EU issue.“That renting and housing crisis is common all over Europe and the EU parliament will have to taken an interest in it.”He says the future of Europe question is not being raised so much in Ireland where there is “almost universal support” for our membership.“Some of the candidates on the left are ambivalent. Yes, be critical but stand up for Europe,” he says.A difficulty for Labour has been the candidacy of Senator Alice Mary Higgins, who also happens to be the daughter of former Labour minister and now President Michael D Higgins. Some Labour activist were annoyed at the move, believing it scotched any hope of White winning a seat.“There are candidates from the Labour family,” says White diplomatically. “They might undermine your chance as the lead candidate in the centre left to get a first preference vote.”For her part, Higgins refuses to be drawn into a battle with Labour.“I ran as independent senator and set up the civil engagement group in the Seanad. I have been doing politics in a different way and making sure that civil society groups feel very connected.”She says the next five years are crucial for a sustainable Europe. “We need to prioritise peace-building over militarisation. There are new challenges in the shape of Brexit, the rise of the far right and climate change. We want next EU parliament to be much better at talking to civil society,” she says.She has been involved in many campaigns and has been active in the Seanad. But she came into the race late and might not be widely known enough to draw enough votes. You might have said the same for the Social Democrats councillor, Garry Gannon. He has a high profile in Dublin Central and could win a Dáíl seat there but is not yet a household name in the capital.Why run for Europe then? “I’m of generation that considers themselves European,” he replies. “It’s going to be the most important parliament in the world over the next decade.“I want to bring a voice forward that say we can lead on climate, on changes in technology and automation that displaces people from work.”His message if firmly geared towards a younger demographic and he believes he can do well if they come out to vote.“Sure it’s a crowded field on the left. I have been utilising a lot of social media. One of our videos has gone viral. We have dropped 110,000 leaflets. For this election I wanted to test myself. I think we are distinguishing ourselves from the pack,” he says.For the second Fine Gael candidate, Mark Durkan, the challenge seemed the same. It was always going to be a long shot for a second seat, and Fitzgerald was always to be the front-runner. He was, as he says himself, a “Nordie” coming into the race.“When I was approached earlier this year by Leo Varadkar I did not say ‘Yes’ straight away. But then I said if I say ‘No’ because it’s outside my comfort zone, that meant I did not want to take the risk and defend the Good Friday Agreement. It was something that I helped deliver and we need to protect it especially with the threat of Brexit.”Durkan is widely respected and has pledged to move to Dublin. But in a crowded field he would really have to dislodge Andrews to take a second seat for Fine Gael.The  caught up with the former Fianna Fáil minister canvassing in Artane Grove, with all the Haugheys, local TD Sean, his brother Ciaran, and their brother Conor’s son, Cathal, who is a local election candidates.Andrews comes from an established Fianna Fáil family but he dismisses the tag of elite, pointing out he was the only candidate who had to contest a convention.“One of the things you hear a lot of from the right in Britain is the idea of elite and establishment, and using slogans to undermine people’s faith in multilateralism,” he said.“You hear it on the left. They use that populist slogan quite regularly. And in that sense they have a lot in common.“One third of MEPs elected will be sceptics to the right and and to the left. The very fabric of the EU is at stake.”In Drumheath in Dublin 15, Lynn Boylan canvasses alongside Paul Donnelly, a local councillor.Boylan was unknown before the election five years ago but has come to prominence since for her work on climate change and on the campaign to release Ibrahim Halawa from a Cairo jail.She’s not going to repeat her lofty 23 per cent of 2014. “It is a very different election. The anger not there any more. People are frustrated because they have had elections and they are not seeing changes in the lives,” she says.“If you want change you have to return progressive MEPs. It would be a disaster if two of the four MEPs came from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.”Some say it’s going to be a battle between her and Clare Daly for the one left-wing seat. Boylan’s response has clearly been thought out: “Clare is an excellent TD. The best way to avoid fragmentation of the left vote is to vote for Sinn Féin and then to vote progressively down the ballot sheet and not give Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael a preference.”But as of now, it looks like Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will take a seat each, with a very close battle for the other two seats. Those likely to be in the shake-up are Daly, Boylan, Cuffe and White but with 19 candidates in the race there is potential for some surprises.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":null,"title":"local","story":"Total of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 63 candidates running in 30-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 67 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyTotal of 36 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 60 candidates running in 29-seat constituencyTotal of 35 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 44 candidates running in 24-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 33-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 39-seat constituencyTotal of 89 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTwo weeks before elections 50 visitors enjoy \u0026lsquoan evening of refreshments, food and music\u0026rsquoTotal of 150 candidates running in 63-seat constituencyTotal of 85 candidates running in 37-seat constituencyTotal of 107 candidates running in 55-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 79 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 32 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 90 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 47 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 82 candidates running in 31-seat constituencyTotal of 51 candidates running in 28-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituency31 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyBreakdown of latest  poll numbers indicates growing support for both parties in DublinMore than 500 female candidates are contesting the local elections, many of them under 35Gap in backing for Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil smallest in 2\u0026frac12 years while Sinn F\u0026eacutein also slipsBad news for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar whose personal satisfaction rating continues to fallVoters who care about the right to life must send a message to smug pro-choice partiesCourt records show Nial Ring has been defendant in 16 sets of High Court proceedings since 2004Almost 2,000 candidates will contest 949 seats in 31 city and county councilsCandidate \u0026lsquoconfused\u0026rsquo by party statement after campaigning throughout review processA significant portion of the electorate is making a plea for a move from polarised to a more accommodating form of politicsGreens and People Before Profit also make gains in local electionsKisyombe\u0026rsquos candidacy sparked controversy following backstory inconsistenciesConservatives lose more than 1,100 seats in local elections as Labour loses more than 100 seatsDUP\u0026rsquos first openly gay candidate elected to Newtownabbey Borough CouncilIrreverent campaign asked people to vote all the way down the ballot in PR-STV electionTalks designed to restore devolution set to begin next Tuesday after Thursday\u0026rsquos pollAlison Bennington is party candidate for the Glengormley urban area of Newtownabbey Borough CouncilParty has launched 111 candidates for the local elections, and three candidates for the European electionsExtended licensing hours for serving alcohol also considered as part of local election planVoters outside the capital must use manual processPosters are an important part of our electoral and democratic process, says KinsellaPoliticians risk \u0026euro150 fine per early election posterThe upcoming local and European elections are powerful platforms for the marginalised to make their voices heardCommittee says message to local and European candidates had been \u0026lsquomisunderstood\u0026rsquoBusConnects reforms would create 230km of bus lanes along 16 traffic corridorsWe need to establish why more immigrants don\u0026rsquot participate in politics, says one candidateCouncillor-migrant internship scheme seeks to encourage greater migrant involvementInstagram helps politicians present a more rounded image.

Photograph: Toby Melville Theresa May’s agreed statement with 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady on Thursday confirmed that she will soon become the fourth successive Conservative prime minister to be destroyed by the issue of Europe.May will meet Brady after the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) in the first week in June to agree a timetable for her departure regardless of the Bill’s fate.Almost everyone at Westminster expects the government to lose the second reading vote, dooming the Bill and May’s Brexit deal and triggering an immediate Conservative leadership contest. But as international development secretary Rory Stewart observed on Thursday, nobody is able to prophesy what is going to happen with Brexit.“The reality is that it seems to be checkmate in every direction.\u0026nbspMy instinct is we’ve just got to get this through by hook or by crook, there’s got to be some way of driving this thing through because this is not good for business, it’s not good for citizens,” he said.There are just two ways that the prime minister could defy expectations to keep the Bill alive past its second reading, thus sustaining the hope that her legacy will be more than a failure to deliver Brexit. The first rests on Labour either supporting the Bill in its second reading or acquiescing in its passage to the committee stage.Labour’s positionJeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said on Wednesday that the party could not support the Bill unless a broader agreement on Brexit emerges from its current talks with the government. But he declined six times to rule out abstaining in the vote on the second reading, feeding speculation that Labour could stand back and allow the vote to pass.In the Commons on Thursday, Brexit secretary Keir Starmer sought to remove any doubt about Labour’s position.“Let me make clear that Labour opposes the idea of passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill without an agreed deal. That would put the cart before the horse, and Labour will therefore vote against the Bill’s second reading,” he said.The WAB is not the withdrawal agreement itself but the legislation required to implement it, including the terms of a standstill transition, the £39 billion “orce bill” and the Northern Ireland backstop. Even if it passes, MPs would still have to approve the withdrawal agreement in a “meaningful vote” unless the WAB is amended to make such a vote unnecessary.May’s second option for winning a vote on the second reading is to insert into the text of the Bill some reassurance on the backstop that could persuade more Conservative Brexiteers and perhaps even the DUP to support it.Brady has proposed amending the Bill to put into British law a commitment to ensure that “alternative arrangements” for the Border are in place before the end of the post-Brexit transition period.Diplomatic messBrady says his amendment would not require any change to the withdrawal agreement or to the backstop but Brussels and Dublin are deeply suspicious. The EU’s Brexit negotiators are “wary of Bradyism in all its forms”, according to one senior EU source, and could view any such amendment as a failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement.The prime minister may be willing to take that chance if it keeps the WAB and her Brexit deal alive, not least because it will be for her successor to untangle the diplomatic mess with Brussels. If the Bill does pass its second reading, the government has said it will accept any amendments that win a majority in the Commons.This could leave the Bill freighted with impossible or even contradictory amendments, leaving the next prime minister with a fresh negotiation with Brussels.In the more likely event that the Bill falls at its second reading next month, what to do about Brexit will be at the centre of the Conservative leadership contest. Regardless of any promises made to win the prize, the next prime minister will face the same challenges as May does, both at Westminster and in Brussels.And when the October 31st deadline approaches, MPs will face the same choice as today, between no deal, no Brexit and the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We can only say that management action is ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.Commodore Cooke-Priest, who joined the Royal Navy in 1990, had only been in command of the 280-metre, 65,000-tonne vessel, described by the Royal Navy as an awe-inspiring warship capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft, since last October.He was never warned that using the Ford Galaxy for personal journeys was in breach of rules, the paper reports.A former officer told The Sun: Nick adores the Navy and has lost his career by doing what captains have done for decades - using the company car to get home. An innocent mistake has cost the Navy one of its best.It is believed that major Royal Navy warships and their captains are loaned a car for use on official duties. An investigation found he had used the Ford as if it was his own, and found him guilty of an error of judgment, according to The Sun.He paid for the petrol and there is no allegation of fraud.HMS Queen Elizabeth in numbersCooke-Priestspecialised as a Lynx helicopter observer after joining the Royal Navy.

Evidently, the outflow is related to the subject of the priests\u0027 scandal and favours the European Coalition, he told Newsweek, adding that smaller right-wing parties had also seen their support increase.These include the far-right Confederation party, whose support grew by five percentage points in the space of a week to hit 6.9 per cent, the survey showed.The sex abuse documentary has been viewed more than 18 million times on YouTube since it was released last Saturday.PiS has responded to the public outcry by announcing tougher penalties for child abuse but it has also stressed that the instances of abuse by priests should not be used as a reason to attack the Catholic Church. PiS sees Catholicism as a key element of Poles\u0027 national identity.Liberal Poles say the Church is too powerful. Izabela Styczynska, the president of Warsaw-based think tank the Center for Social and Economic Research, said negative perceptions of PiS and the Church had increased following the film, but added: The question is - will this last?Not all analysts were convinced by the survey\u0027s findings. I don\u0027t doubt that support for PiS is falling... but I don\u0027t know if it would be by as much as 10 percentage points, said Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at Warsaw University, adding the poll results appeared exaggerated.European elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?How to vote for your MEP in the European electionsTourists who misbehave in Venice to be fined up to €500 and banned with Asbo-style decrees The Big Bang Theory\u0026#39s feel-good finale: why it was time for America\u0026#39s biggest comedy to endEuropean elections latest polls: Brexit Party forecast to win majority of UK seats Comment: How can Labour members stay in a party that\u0026#39s openly backed by anti-Semitic terrorists?Public sector strikes fall to record low in wake of new Trade Union laws making it harder to walk out, data shows \u0026#39Theresa May is a failure as Prime Minister\u0026#39-  readers react to this week\u0026#39s storiesComment: If we don\u0026#39t radically change course on Brexit, the party I love will not surviveLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s wedding: who are the royal couple getting married this weekend?White supremacist Jack Renshaw who plotted to murder Rosie Cooper MP gives Nazi salute as he is jailed for lifeComment: Why Britain must lead the way in protecting civilians in 21st Century conflictFans mourn as internet-famous Grumpy Cat dies aged 7 More than 750,000 fans sign petition to remake Game of Thrones season 8John \u0026#39Goldfinger\u0026#39 Palmer murder at centre of police appeal after Spanish fraud trialFatal stabbings hit 100 in Britain in 2019How Brexit killed the concept of an EU exit Trump unveils radical plan to boost high-skilled migrationTaiwan becomes first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriageBrexit latest news: Cross-party talks with Labour set to end without agreementWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/10/13/samsung-fold.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/10/13/samsung-fold.jpg","title":"apple developer academy naples wwdc","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

These include Hear Me Well, which turns the iPhone into a hearing aid device.Students currently at the Academy talk about how they regard it as “a perfect educational environment to develop an insatiable thirst and curiosity for development” or that it “gives you a toolbox to take your idea and turn it into reality”.iPhone owners can sue Apple over its apps, US Supreme Court decidesThe academy is part of Apple’s commitment to making coding accessible to everyone. Apple’s connection to the Malala Fund has also been a way that the company has helped spread education, including coding, to girls around the world. Apple is committed to reaching 100,000 girls worldwide through coding. The academy news came on the same day as Apple announced a partnership with Simplon in Paris.Simplon is a social enterprise in France focused on communities that would otherwise find it difficult to access training - and the training is offered at no charge.\u0026nbspSimplon has a network of organisations in France and elsewhere, which has trained more than 2,000 trainees in the digital sector since 2013. The collaboration is to teach Swift, Apple’s coding language, with a new focus on refugee and displaced young women, and women from underserved communities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, given the scale of the loyalty penalty, this won\u0027t be enough to solve the problem.“The Competition and Markets Authority was clear in its response to our super-complaint that regulators must report on their progress by June. We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam.”Which? head of home products and services Natalie Hitchins said: “Until now many customers have found themselves paying over the odds for staying with their provider after their initial contract has ended - so notifying people in advance that they may be about to be hit by these poor-value rolling tariffs is a step in the right direction.“Providers should be fighting hard to show that they deserve to hold on to their customers, not hitting them with an unexpected price hike the minute their contract is up.”Digital Minister Margot James said: “For too long, large numbers of loyal consumers have been paying too much for their telecoms services, which is why we\u0027ve also strengthened Ofcom\u0027s powers to create a fairer and more transparent system.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Deliveroo has issues when it comes to relations with its workforce, and Amazon isn\u0027t likely to be able to help much with themClick to followThe IndependentDeliveroo has secured a big investment but will that benefit its deliverers? There’s no more tasty a dish than the millions of dollars in Amazon cash Deliveroo is set to chow down on.\u0026nbspThe US tech kingpin is the lead investor in the\u0026nbspLondon based food delivery firm’s latest cash call, which raised $575m (£450m) in total.\u0026nbspBad news for Uber. It has obviously had its\u0026nbspattention\u0026nbspon other things of late, such as a New York Flotation and the indigestion caused to investors by the lacklustre after market for its shares.\u0026nbspEU introduces new minimum rights for ‘gig economy’ workersBut Uber Eats remains an important part of its attempt to expand beyond its ride sharing app. It even reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo.\u0026nbspThe would be Amazon of transport now has to contend with the real Amazon backing a major rival in that space.\u0026nbspAmazon had a crack at the business itself, only to retreat. That isn’t unusual. The same thing happened with its attempt to break into ticket sales, for example.\u0026nbspIt’s a restless experimenter, something that plays a key role in its success. This\u0026nbspmeans\u0026nbspaccepting that they’re not all going to work and being willing to\u0026nbspmove on when they don’t.\u0026nbspThe interesting thing here is that Amazon is not moving on. It’s a case of if you can’t beat ‘em, buy in. The investment gives it a seat at the table and a chance to see what works and what doesn’t with a company that’s succeeding with a business it was interested in but couldn’t make fly.“We’re excited to see what they do next,” said Amazon’s UK country manager Doug Gurr. And we’re just as excited to see what we can learn through watching the development of out new best pals’\u0026nbsp“innovative technology and service”.\u0026nbspAmazon has also reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo outright and if\u0026nbspfounder Will Shu does come to see a sale rather than a flotation as the end game, it would now surely be in the box seat.\u0026nbspIn the meantime Shu benefits from having the big dog in his corner and at the end of a phone line if he needs it. The market is taking that very seriously, with shares in rivals such as Just Eat falling sharply in response to the news.\u0026nbspThe biggest challenge for Deliveroo, which has raised $1.5bn to date, is the same as that facing Uber, Lyft, and many of the other current generation of tech stars. It has to find a way of sustainably turning a profit.\u0026nbspAmazon has an excellent handle on how to prove the doubters wrong when it comes to moving from a loss making investment phase to making handsome profit. In the meantime, it will be more relaxed about Deliveroo’s losses than almost any other investor, more willing to give it the leeway to be aggressive. This helps to explain why rivals shuddered.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those in attendance\u0026nbspon the French Riviera gave the film\u0026nbspa standing ovation, yet the reviews have been lukewarm.\u0026nbspDirected by Dexter Fletcher and starring Taron Egerton, Rocketman has been called a fantastical account of the “Tiny Dancer” singer’s life,\u0026nbsprather than a warts-and-all telling.Many critics compared the film to\u0026nbspQueen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which was worked on by Dexter Fletcher, who took over as director from Brian Singer midway through production. Bohemian Rhapsody defied middling reviews to gross upwards of\u0026nbsp£705 million at the global box office.The Independent‘s\u0026nbspGeoffrey Macnab\u0026nbspsaid Fletcher “uses lavish musical sequences to whisk his way through episodes in Elton John’s life”. Macnab describes the film as ing into some of Elton’s darkest moments, but that\u0026nbspthese are filmed in a\u0026nbsp”very flamboyant fashion” that\u0026nbsp”manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour”.Created with Sketch.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.The album was preceded by brief clips for the song’s “IGOR’S THEME”, “NEW MAGIC WAND”, “WHATSGOOD” and “a boy is a gun”.\u0026nbspThe self-confessed Call Me By Your Name fan also drops a reference to the film on “I Think”, with the line: “And I wish you would call me by your name ’cause I’m sorry.”\u0026nbspKanye West pays tribute to Nipsey Hussle at Sunday ServiceTyler the Creator praises musician for comedy breakdown of his musicTyler previously referenced CMBYN star Timothée Chalamet on his single “OKRA”.He shared a disclaimer on his social media before the album’s release: “Don’t go into this expecting a rap album,” he said. “Don’t go into this expecting any album.”Early fan reactions to the record have been largely positive on social media. It is available to download and stream on all major platforms including iTunes and Spotify.\u0026nbspTyler the CreatorThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it makes clear the Prime Minister is ready\u0026nbspto give Conservative MPs a free vote on the issue, so long as Jeremy Corbyn does the same for Labour.It is understood that the plan was drawn up by the Government as it became clear that the talks\u0026nbspwould not produce a compromise Brexit deal, but has not been agreed by Labour.The document emerged just moments before Mr Corbyn pulled the plug on the talks process, which has stretched over more than six weeks but appears to have foundered on the issue of post-Brexit customs arrangements and Labour concerns that any deal could be torn up by a future Tory leader.The plan set out in the leaked paper envisages a series of four votes to take place on June 5\u0026nbspon:Whether the UK should leave the EU with a dealSetting a new deadline of July 31 for BrexitRuling out a second referendumA package of Goverment concessions to\u0026nbspLabour on issues like workers’ rights and participation in EU agencies.Crucially, the paper indicates that the two sides have not agreed on post-Brexit customs arrangements. It proposes a separate series of “elimination ballots” on a range of four options, from Labour’s favoured comprehensive customs union with a UK say to a looser arrangement allowing Britain to forge its own deals elsewhere in the world.Results from the four indicative votes and the elimination ballots are unlikely to be known in time to shape the drafting of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill, due to come back before\u0026nbspthe Commons in the week of June 3, says the document. But under the indicative votes plan,\u0026nbspMPs’ preferences would be reflected in draft Government amendments to the legislation.The plan was denounced by People\u0027s Vote campaigners as a cynical attempt to block a second Brexit referendum.Created with Sketch.Brexit billboards: Campaigners remind MPs of past promises Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage has spent his political career campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.Boris Johnson\u0027s support for Brexit took many by surprise before the EU referendum.The UK and EU are yet to agree on a withdrawal deal.

It seems she is perfectly happy to trade any promise she has ever made on Brexit just so long as she can keep the ultimate decision in the hands of politicians.Brexit talks between May and Labour have collapsed, Corbyn saysFresh Brexit intrigue made my first week go with a bangCorbyn should heed Momentum’s message on Brexit“For Labour the choice is now as much moral as it is political.“It can choose to endorse a Conservative plan that cuts people out of the decision by propping up an ailing Government’s decrepit strategy that will dismay both sides of the Brexit debate. It can choose to defy the overwhelming majority of its members, voters and MPs. It can choose endorsement of a broken Brexit deal that breaks most of the promises made for Brexit and in which any concessions will doubtless be ripped up by the hardliner chosen by the Tory members to replace the Prime Minister.“Or Labour can now take a stand and make it clear there is no prospect of Labour ever agreeing to any Brexit deal that is not handed back to the people for the final say.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot then tried to get him via video link from jail, but he again refused to participate.In , when -year-old Toronto woman Rehab Dughmosh refused to appear in court on terror-related charges, even liberal old Canada issued an “extremely rare” legal order for the wonderfully phrased “cell extraction”.Five officers were given the authority to,necessary, restrain and drag her to court by the scruff of her neck even , as one court official put it: “It may require shackles on the hands and feet.”Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.So, did -year-old McCann, from Aylesbury, Bucks, get the same treatment  Dream on. Instead, the judge, court clerk and prosecution and defence teams were all forced to up sticks and travel  miles to the prison with, don’t laugh, the official court crest in an Argos carrier bag.There, the judge visited McCann in the healthcare wing, where he refused to confirm his name, wouldn’t stand and, at one point, reportedly turned his back to the impromptu hearing before stating he had “been stitched up”.And it seems he’s not alone in this disgraceful behaviour that’s being indulged by our pathetically weak “justice” system.Last year, Gloucester’s top judge, Jamie Tabor QC, said it has now “become fashionable for defendants to refuse to come to court”, noting that the worrying trend started around two years earlier.Yet as far back as , convicted drug dealer Amir Ali refused to attend a confiscation hearing at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex because he feared losing his cell to another inmate while he was away and claimed it was a breach of his human rights.At the time, Judge Richard Hayward lashed out at the “barking mad” rules stemming from the  Human Rights Act. He added: “I didn’t know that prisoners could choose whether or not to come to court. I just assumed they would be scooped up by a burly prison warden and dumped in the back of a van.” So did we, Judge. So did we.Yet here we are,  years later, still allowing the human rights of an alleged criminal to run roughshod over the court’s authority.IT’S rumoured that -year-old Grace Jones may be filming a scene with Daniel Craig for the upcoming th Bond movie. Cue much excitement about unleashing the power of the older woman, yada yada.Bring it on. But let’s hope Ms Jones’ character fares better than the last time an “older actress” was announced, amid much fanfare, for the movie Spectre.It was -year-old Monica Bellucciand the scene involved her being groped up against a wall by Daniel Craig, who then left her languishing in a basque and stockings while he went off and fell in love with someone younger.The earth may well have moved for Monica’s character, but ground-breaking it was not.MADELEINE McCANN would have been  on Sunday. Sweet . The age when girls start to blossom into young women, steal our make-up and clothes, have myriad crushes and secrets we might never find out about.Instead, her parents Kate and Gerry have passed another torturous year of not knowing whether she’s dead or alive.Wishing their daughter a happy birthday on their Find Maddie Facebook page, they added: “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.”Spending a quiet day at home with their other two children, they reportedly placed presents in Maddie’s room and blew out the candles on a commemorative cake.To not celebrate would perhaps feel like an abandonment of hope. My heart goes out to them and all the other parents of missing children.

They’re wearing a fake bump.We already have to tolerate those ads for disability aids that feature a thirtysomething with the agility of a mountain goat simply because companies clearly feel that showing hair loss, wrinkles and bunions is a little too much reality.Now we’re being flogged the illusion thatwe buy certain maternity clothes, we too might swerve the plight of swollen ankles and Popeye arms.Fat chance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An innocent mistake has cost the Navy one of its best.”Traditionally major Royal Navy warships and their captains are loaned a car for use on official duties.They used to be Jaguars or Land Rovers until the Brit car company ended the deal amid cost concerns.A Top Brass probe found the officer had used the Ford asit was his own, and found him guilty of an “error of judgment”. He was relieved of his duties just days ago.It is not known what private trips he used it for, but one insider claimed he was driving it at weekends.The respected officer paid for petrol and there is no allegation of fraud.A source said: “We’re sacricing one of our best operational Commanding Officers to ensure we’re beyond whiter than white. Queen Elizabeth’s sailors have lost an exceptional and popular captain because of a policy which looks like it’s politically driven.“A few years ago, all he would have got is a slap on the wrist.”However, some backed the decision, and called his position “untenable”.A source said of Commodore Cooke-Priest, who was in charge of a -strong crew: “He has to be whiter than white, beyond reproach, completely clean. The fact is he can’t discipline his own crewhe can’t follow the rules.“This was an error of judgment and action had to be taken.”It is understood he has not yet been handed any formal punishment – but that process is continuing.He is likely to get a minor censure – but sources said at his age and seniority it almost certainly means the end of his stand-out career.In the meantime he has been assigned a “new role” though the Navy declined to say what that was.The Queen Elizabeth crew — docked alongside HMS Prince of Wales at Rosyth in Scotland – were told yesterday that their captain was being moved on.They were also informed that the Prince of Wales’ skipper Steve Moorhouse will be taking over because he needed more experience.New Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt heaped praise on both carriers just a few days ago.She said: “Nothing symbolises our intent and ambition for global Britain and captured the hearts of our citizens more than our new carriers.”The Royal Navy said: “We can confirm Captain Nick Cooke-Priest has been reassigned to a new role.

warning that the Tory race to replace Mrs May meant any compromise was doomed to fail.But the PM blamed Labours shambolic Brexit policy for the breakdown, saying the party cant decide whether or not it even wants to leave the EU.Mr Corbyn claimed talks have now gone as far as they can after Mrs May refused to sign up to his soft Brexit fudge which would keep Britain in the customs union.She could now hold Commons votes on a number of dferent options next week to seethere is any Brexit outcome MPs can actually support.In a letter to the PM, Mr Corbyn said: It has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us.He also pointed to Liam Foxs desire for a UK-US trade deal, including the import of American foods such as chlorinated chicken, as a key factor in leading to the end of negotiations.Mr Corbyn concluded: Without signicant changes, we will continue to oppose the Government’s deal as we do not believe it safeguards jobs, living standards and manufacturing industry in Britain.Speaking on the campaign trail in Bristol, Mrs May responded: We havent been able to overcome the fact that there isnt a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum which could reverse it.And the PMs spokesman said: We have made real progress on some issues such as workers rights and environmental protections, but it is clear that we are not going to be able to reach a complete agreement.In particular there have been very challenging discussions in respect of the dferent positions of the two sides on customs and the holding of a second referendum.The Prime Minister continues to believe it is the duty of elected politicians to deliver on the result of the referendum.No sources blamed Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary who led Labours side of the talks, for refusing to compromise on his demand for a second referendum.Hardliners from both the Tories and Labour welcomed the end of the talks and called on their party leaders to resist any further compromise.Brexiteer backbencher Simon Clarke said: Thank God. They ought never to have happened.Ex-minister Priti Patel added: Many of us did question the judgement of the Cabinet when they approved those talks...And Lord Adonis, a pro-EU Labour peer, said: Talks between Labour and Mrs May over. They were never going anywhere. The only compromise possible is to put May’s deal to a referendum with an option to remain.Quizzed by reporters this morning, Mr Corbyn denied claims he never intended to get a deal from the talks in the first place - insisting: It was not shadow-boxing.The two sides were hoping to agree on a soft Brexit lasting until the next General Election.That would allow the voters to choose between Labours preferred option of a permanent customs union, and the looser arrangement backed by the Tories.Conservative Brexiteers were furious at the prospect of Mrs May watering down her Brexit deal any further.And Labour rebels said they wouldnt back any compromise agreement without a second referendum attached.The collapse of talks suggests the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is doomed when it reached the Commons next month.MPs will have their say on the bill in the first week of June in what will effectively be a fourth meaningful vote on Mrs Mays withdrawal agreement. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   letter-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" No sources expect to lose by around  votes without Labour on side.

A columnist at the left-leaning New Statesman magazine described it as curating “a morbidly chaotic picture of a British underclass — for those watching at home to scoff and sneer”.Over at the self-appointed moral compass of Britain, , an editorial complained it preyed on “vulnerable, unhappy people”, turning “a blind eye to mental health problems”. writer Zoe Williams had previously claimed: “Jeremy Kyle has created the cultural spectre of this feral underclass, none of whom has the smallest amount of emotional restraint.”Such bile aimed at a show loved by so many — the final episode, on Friday last week, drew over a million viewers — reveals as much about Kyle as who our commentariat feel has the right to speak, and how they are meant to do it.Kyle’s cull comes at a time of unprecedented openness around personal and mental health issues — as middle-class public figures are lauded for sharing their private woes.Yet working-class people airing their issues on daytime TV find themselves derided.Perhaps Kyle’s guests didn’t speak with the right accent or wear the right clothes. They didn’t have impressive jobs or double-barreled names. They did not articulate themselves calmly, via book deals, or break down on Instragram with full faces of make-up.Rather than be celebrated for bravery, they are written off as dysal.Many of Kyle’s guests did not have mental health issues — they were normal people discussing their problems. There were estranged parents, people struggling to trust or dealing with addiction.Kyle gave real people a voice. Among those who have complained about experiences on the show, many have also said it helped them.Although judgmental about his guests’ actions, Kyle did not judge his guests. Open about his own problems, he believed his guests were as capable of turning their lives around as him. This is more credit than many commentators have given them.It’s offensive to hear Kyle’s adult guests written off as “vulnerable”, asincapable of deciding whether to appear. After  years, , episodes and  series, they would have known Kyle’s style. These were adults choosing to share stories on a  that mattered to them.It comes, of course, as royalty, showbiz celebrities and broadsheet columnists have been praised for publicly airing their personal problems. Never have we celebrated sharing these issues so loudly. When Prince Harry spoke of coming close to a breakdown, singer Will Young his struggle with anxiety and model Cara Delevingne her depression, people applauded.They belong to an industry of openness. Books chronicling personal struggles with mental health are being published to acclaim. Such as Susannah Cahalan’s memoir Brain On Fire, about her psychosis. Or Matt Haig’s memoir about depression, Reasons To Stay Alive. Documentaries such as Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain’s this week, Anxiety And Me, are praised.Sharing such issues is important. Prince Harry, on his tour of Australia, spoke thoughtfully about how people “must not silently suffer” and must share problems because others “will relish the opportunity to listen or talk themselves”. Yet apparently all this admiration for openness does not extend to Kyle’s guests.Charles Walker complained they were “emotional”. This from a man commended for speaking about his OCD, which he said made him a “practising fruitcake”.Onewriter described Kyle’s guests as “delinquent children, tearaway teens, feckless fathers, long-term unemployed . . . alcoholics, junkies, the sexually insecure, the sexually confused, the sexually poly-amorous” — but could have been describing contributors to the paper’s blog Comment Is Free.District judge Alan Berg described Kyle’s show as “human bear-baiting” and “a morbid and depressing display of dysal people who are in some kind of turmoil”.Asyou couldn’t say the same about many in the House of Commons.The bile for Kyle contrasts, too, with praise of other reality TV — in particular, Love Island. Also aired on ITV, it has seen the suicide of two of its former contestants. Yet the show is celebrated. columnist Leah Green  praised how it “makes the complexities of British society so tangible they can’t be ignored”. Another column in the paper cheered it as “a place where liars and love rats get called out and prejudices are exposed.” It opined: “There is something to be gleaned here about friendship, race . . . and the way men and women communicate.”Perhaps such lessons are just more palatable when they come via men with tanned six-packs and women with perfect teeth.When I watched Kyle’s show I didn’t see a “feral under-class”. I saw people I know. I saw real le, which is messy, dysal and chaotic, which does not always come out in well-formed sentences, memoirs or documentaries made by people with posh accents for Radio .I didn’t watch Kyle to sneer. I watched with relief that some people were truly open about the madness of le. What happens to them now Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And after Russia, illegal campaign finance and data abuse were used to push the country up the gangplank, we were told it was unsinkable, irreversible, and those icebergs probably want to be friends.Three years on, with Labour locked below decks, Tories fighting over the leboats and Change UK starting to play Nick Cleggaposs  Overture, the cold water is lapping around our ankles and the captain has rearranged the deckchairs no less than  times.The officers have decided the only option is to throw the captain overboard. This would be a marvellous idea,the reason for the flooding in decks  through , was that Neptune demanded the sacrice of someone who wants to be perfectly clear.But Neptune is about as imaginary as a technological border solution, which means that tossing Theresa into the waves will achieve bugger all. Brexit is still sinking, holed by a iety of punchily-impossible assertions and a fundamental design flaw which treated Northern Ireland like a third-class passenger who didnapost matter.In this analogy, you may wish to see Theresa as either a deckchair that refuses to fold or a priceless blue diamond. Neither option includes a NVQ in plumbing, a qualication that, you should also note, is absent from every single potential replacement. Itaposs inevitable theyaposll toss her out, though, because pointless but emotionally-satisfying gestures are what Brexit is all about. And what will follow are  things that are as predictably bad as a Celine Dion lyric. . This crap will go onOnce Theresa is gone, thereaposll be a leadership contest. If it all goes according to plan, itaposll produce a leader by September. Who will then have a WHOLE month to uny a ided party, agree a Parliamentary deal with Labour, negotiate a fresh withdrawal agreement with Brussels and put Nigel Farage back in his box.No-one can do that. A politician created in a lab with the DNA of Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and Good Queen Bess couldnapost do it. So the new PM will ask to extend Brexit once again, while considering their next step.The options are to Just Bloody Brexit, which will mean instant border checks in Northern Ireland weaposve neither the staff nor legal right to perform to agree a Customs Union deal with Labour to enable a Sort Of Brexit, which will please the voters but destroy both major parties or Balls to Brexit which the inevitably-Brexity PM will never countenance.Northern Ireland demands a customs union. Parliamentary arithmetic demands compromise. And because the PM wonapost be able to do either of those things, their best hope is for a new leader bounce in the polls enabling them to call a snap election, in which they might but probably wonapost get a bigger majority.  . Boris will cock up whatever comes nextThe only dference between Chris Grayling and Boris Johnson is that Boris fails on a grander scale. Heaposs not one to quietly ignore advice from experts and rack up a £million bill for ferries that donapost exist. The blond bombshell prefers extravagant lies, the utter destruction of truth and an entirely-misplaced confidence in a God-given right to rule that hasnapost been seen in Westminster since Charles I strutted into the House of Commons and told it to behave.The first person to declare in a leadership race never wins Boris has shown his pudgy hand. Anyone replacing Theresa must bring Remainers with them Boris is their voodoo doll of choice. Whoever enters Downing Street next will need a plan Boris has yet to work out what the word means.This is a man whose one consistent characteristic, over decades as a journalist and a politician, has been telling fibs. Brexit has proven to be unforgiving of those who attempt to polish the truth, and a man who has fudged every opinion, bodged every resignation, and lied to every we have shown himself better at polishing than he is doing. The only unknown is HOW he cocks it up.. Jeremy Corbyn will be a step closer to power  If Theresa falls, it will be because Labour wouldnapost help her out. The Tories will be weakened, and the replacement PM will most likely be an entrenched Brexit loon even less likely to get an improved deal or unite their party.When that PM fails to get a new withdrawal agreement and brings Theresaaposs back to Parliament, when they threaten a No Deal exit thereaposs no support for, when they call an election no-one wants and when they can attract donors but no new voters, Labour should in theory be in a stronger position. Itaposs theoretical, because the Opposition wonapost agree on what to oppose. Labour will haemorrhage supporters. But it will still be in a better position than the Tories, which canapost even count on the DUP these days, to form a coalition and catapult Corbyn into the hot seat.Whereupon, of course, heaposll have all the same problems as the Tories, except in reverse. . People will shout OH, GET ON WITH ITWe voted! they shout. Respect democracy ! Do the hard stuff I donapost want to. Cut my taxes, raise his, love nurses, hate teachers, who needs librarians, letaposs talk about something , for Peteaposs sake. Voters are ided between people who, toddler-like, demand the Brexit they were promisedthey were good, and those who act more like bored -year-olds who just LOATHE Brexit because it resembles an exam they have not revised for.The fact no parent can keep both these children happy with the same thing is why weaposre in this mess. Explanations are no use, logic is irrelevant and bribery is temporary. Every time you hear a voter say just get on with it, imagine a child at the kitchen table demanding dinner of a parent with no oven, no fridge, and no thumbs. Blame the parentyou want, kids, but in this scenario youaposre going to have to be the grown-up. . Still no Brexit, folksYouaposll have a new PM. Perhaps youaposll have several. Youaposll have waded through thousands of words about David Cameronaposs diaries, which can be boiled down to I didnapost f*** a pig and itaposs not my fault. The phrase Brexit uncertainty will become a legitimate excuse for the closure of steel foundries, Liverpool winning the league and Borisapos next relationship breakdown. But you still wonapost have Brexit. Perhaps it was possible,someone had added a clause to the ballot paper about the United Kingdom exiting from itself as well. But it was always a bit of a reach, a shiny, fictional thing tainted by dodgy dealings, bad behaviour and a history that couldnapost be unwritten.The reason the old lady tosses the rock in the sea at the end of the film is that, when she grew up, she realised it was just a rock. And the only way out of Brexit is for a country to say it was only an idea, and a bad one at that.When someone tells you that .m voted for it so it must happen, point out that My Heart Will Go On sold more than that and no-one listens to that any more, either.If Brexit was a ship of dreams, then itaposs time to wake up.

In a letter confirming he was pulling the plug, Mr Corbyn told the PM: “It has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us.Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your Government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.” Corbynaposs letter to Theresa May set out the reasons why the talks broke down after six weeks.They are:The increasing instability of Mayaposs government The opposition to compromises from senior members of the Cabinet Chicken...Yes you read that one right.   One of the reasons Jeremy Corbyn cited for ending the six week talks was chicken - more specfically the governmentaposs failure to rule out a future trade deal with the USA which could see chlorinated chicken on British dinner tables.A proposed post-Brexit trade deal with the US has provoked fears over food safety because of a dference in standards between the US and the EU. Donald Trump has insisted that any post-Brexit trade deal gives the US comprehensive market access and the removal of unwanted barriers. American companies have long complained that European Union regulations limit American exports of food products like chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-boosted beef and genetically-modied crops.But Labour is committed to protecting British food standards - meaning any deal would have to rule out the type of deal favoured by Donald Trump.So when he wrote The International Trade Secretary has confirmed that importing chlorinated chicken as part of a US trade deal remains on the table, Jeremy Corbyn was showcasing how little the government were willing to compromise on.Read Jeremy Corbynaposs speech in full Dear Prime Minister I am writing to let you know that I believe the talks between us about finding a compromise agreement on leaving the European Union have now gone as far as they can. I would like to put on record that the talks have been conducted in good faith on both sides and thank those involved for their efforts to find common ground. The talks have been detailed, constructive and have involved considerable effort for both our teams.    However, it has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us. Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us. As I said when we met on Tuesday evening, there has been growing concern in both the Shadow Cabinet and parliamentary Labour Party about the governmentaposs ability to deliver on any compromise agreement. As you have been setting out your decision to stand down and Cabinet ministers are competing to succeed you, the position of the government has become ever more unstable and its authority eroded. Not infrequently, proposals by your negotiating team have been publicly contradicted by statements from other members of the Cabinet. In recent days we have heard senior Cabinet ministers reject any form of customs union, regardless of proposals made by government negotiators. And despite assurances we have been given on protection of environmental, food and animal welfare standards, the International Trade Secretary has confirmed that importing chlorinated chicken as part of a US trade deal remains on the table. "},{"url":null,"title":"paul routledge how fair days","story":"NewsopinionPaul Routledge: How about a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work As the welfare state continues to fail so many, Labours John McDonnell has proposed a Universal Basic IncomeShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  MAY NewsopinionJohn McDonnell is an advocate of a Universal Basic Income \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEverybody gets a prize in the fantasy race in Alice in Wonderland.

The Shadow Chancellor thinks it is an idea whose time has come. He has £ a week in mind, plus £ for each child, taking the place of existing benefits. A Corbyn government would trial UBI in a number of cities – probably ­Liverpool, Sheffield and somewhere in the Midlands – to seeit works.    The principle looks attractive, but experiments abroad are not encouraging.

The failure to crack the deadlock after six weeks of tense talks paves the way for Mrs May to suffer a fourth and final humiliating defeat on her Brexit pact - forcing her out of No.    Campaigning in Bristol for next Thursday’s European Parliament elections, the PM claimed: “We have not been able to overcome the fact that there is not a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum which could reverse it.” It had become increasingly clear in Westminster over the past fortnight that talks were doomed. No finally accepted on Thursday night negotiations had reached “the end of the road”, a source revealed. The admission came less than  hours after Mrs May tearfully bowed to demands and agreed to set a timetable for her departure in the first week of June. But her capitulation fuelled Labour fears any pact it struck would be torn up by her successor. Mr Corbyn hammered the final nail into the coffin at .am Friday as he published a letter to the PM confirming he was collapsing negotiations.    He told her: “It has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us. “Even more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your Government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.” He cited Mrs May’s looming exit from Downing Street, which triggers a leadership race Boris Johnson is favourite to win. “As you have been setting out your decision to stand down and Cabinet ministers are competing to succeed you, the position of the Government has become ever more unstable and its authority eroded,” wrote Mr Corbyn. “Not infrequently, proposals by your negotiating team have been publicly contradicted by statements from other members of the Cabinet.” The Downing Street source admitted the talks’ breakdown was “disappointing” and pointed the finger of blame at Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir, who is seen as a vocal supporter of a second referendum, is tipped as a potential successor to Mr Corbyn and led talks for Labour. The source said it was “obvious” there was a “signicant dference of opinion” in the Parliamentary Labour Party on a second referendum, adding that isions were apparent among Labour’s negotiating team. “It is clear and has been for the duration that these talks have gone on that there are fundamental splits in Labour, particularly on the question of a second referendum, which breaks down to the choice between whether to honour the referendum or hold a second referendum in an attempt to reverse it,” said the source.    “It is clear, for example, that the Shadow Brexit Secretary has fairly strident views on this issue and he represented and led the Labour team during the ministerial plenary sessions, for the most part.” The source said thatthe Withdrawal Agreement Bill fails to clear the Commons before the summer recess, “the choice will become signicantly more unpalatable, because the arguments about no-deal and whether or not to revoke Article  entirely will become more vocerous”. But Labour source hit back, pointing at Cabinet ministers who blasted any concessions towards a customs union. “No might want to have a word with Liam Fox, Jeremy Hunt, Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss who all made ‘strident’ comments about doing a deal with Labour on a customs union,” said the insider. “Ultimately, this is a Prime Minister that can’t govern and can’t deliver.” Second referendum campaigners seized on the breakdown and issued fresh demands for another vote. Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: “The only way out of this Brexit crisis is to put this back to the people in a confirmatory public vote so that the people get the final say on the future.” Naomi Smith, of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “It’s clear from the breakdown in talks that neither party leader can sell their own version of Brexit to their respective parties. “Labour must now stand firm on its commitment to back a public vote and make it crystal clear that the party won’t engage in any more Westminster back room talks.” The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is set to be voted on the first week in June. Labour has played down suggestions it could abstain and effectively usher through the legislation, with senior frontbenchers insisting they will try to vote it down. But some backbenchers from Leave-supporting heartlands are likely to back the PM’s deal and honour the  result. Mrs May’s spokesman pointed to “real progress on some issues such as workers’ rights and environmental protections” made in negotiations before talks were axed. That could help some Labour MPs support the Bill - though there are unlikely to be enough to cancel out Tories who will oppose the legislation. He added: “The PM continues to believe it is the duty of elected politicians to find a way to deliver on the result of the referendum. “She continues to work hard on securing the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill so that the UK can leave the EU with a deal as soon as possible.” When Brussels issued an Article  extension to October  - delaying Brexit - EU Council President Donald Tusk urged: “Please do not waste this time.: No insisted six weeks of talks with Labour had bene “absolutely in the national interest”. The PM and Mr Corbyn met face-to-face three times for talks, with further discussions over the phone.

Yet the companyaposs website does warn that some work is paid at a piece rate as opposed to an hourly wage. But Stephanie added: I had already flown there, when they sent me an email saying that the hourly paid job was not available yet, and that they would be putting me on a piece rate job.  There are so many factors that can affect your pay. It can be dependent on the quality of the fruit you pick from the tree and eventhe manager likes you or not. They might come over and look at your bin and not be happy, then you’d have to start all over again. And speaking to NewsMail , the backpacker summed up her experience with the phrase  days a slave. Stephanie alleges she was sacked one month into her employment. However, Farmgate Backpackers has rejected the womanaposs claims of mistreatment.  It said % of the backpackers happily ed to the hostel, and it could not always promise farm work because of the unpredictable weather .

Commodore Nick Cooke-Priest, , has been assigned to a new role after reportedly driving the Ford Galaxy for personal use at weekends. Traditionally, captains of Royal Navy warships are given a car to be used as part of their official duties. But a probe is said to have found Commodore Cooke-Priest guilty of an error of judgement before he was relieved of his duties as captain just days ago, reports The Sun. Insiders claim he was never warned that using the car at weekends was a breach of protocol and that an innocent mistake has cost the Navy one of its best.    A Royal Navy spokesman said: We can confirm Captain Nick Cooke-Priest has been reassigned to a new role. We can only say that management action is ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further. Commodore Cooke-Priest, who joined the Royal Navy in , had only been in command of the -metre, ,-tonne vessel, described by the Royal Navy as an awe-inspiring warship capable of carrying up to  aircraft, since last October. He was never warned that using the Ford Galaxy for personal journeys was in breach of rules, the paper reports.     A former officer told The Sun: Nick adores the Navy and has lost his career by doing what captains have done for decades - using the company car to get home. An innocent mistake has cost the Navy one of its best. It is believed that major Royal Navy warships and their captains are loaned a car for use on official duties. An investigation found he had used the Ford asit was his own, and found him guilty of an error of judgment, according to The Sun.  He paid for the petrol and there is no allegation of fraud. He had specialised as a Lynx helicopter observer after joining the Royal Navy. A decade of flying appointments followed, primarily at sea, and included an instructional tour and as Flight Commander of HMS Exeter. He was promoted to Commander in  and that year in HMS Kent escorted the Queen during a royal tour.  On HMS Iron Duke, he was deployed to the Arabian Gulf and in  to Libya as part of Operation Ellamy.

The Richardson gang were the Kray twins biggest rivals  and were known as the capitalaposs most sadistic gangsters. They are said to have pulled teeth out using pliers, cut off toes with bolt cutters and even nailed their victims to the floor. In his explosive book, Eddie has lted the lid on what really happened in Londonaposs gangs in the s. Here he reveals what happened during the gun fight at Mr Smithaposs in Catford.The events of that night lead to Reggie Kray gunning down George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub Whitechapel - and the end of the Kray twinsapos reign. An old pal of mine had an interest in a club in Catford called Mr Smith’s. In March , the place was having trouble with rowdy customers.  The owner, who was from Blackpool, got in touch with my associate Billy Hill and asked him to sort to  it out. Bill asked me and that’s why we were there. The owners wanted to maintain a gaming licence, so had to keep an orderly establishment with gambling and dancing and drinking over and the place closed by am. The deal was that I would organise the ‘security’ inside and on the door of Mr Smith’s. Inwe’d get to place our slot machines in the club we were double dipping with more than one dog in the race. It was a neat, lucrative deal for us and there was no haggling in fact they were really glad of such an arrangement. It was such a good prospect that we went over to the place on Monday,  March  for a look round. Bertie Green from the Astor Club provided the entertainment and the girls. It was a lovely place, the club. A raised dining area, dance floor and a place, a stage, for entertainment. It had the makings of a nice earner.    Everyone was interested in there not being any trouble at Mr Smith’s and, of course, there was no need for there to be. Nice grub, nice drink and nice girls to look at. Where’s the problem  We were well welcomed but did not stay for lunch, saying we’d come back in the evening and sign off on our deal. The snag was a group of local hard men who had decided they were in charge of the club’s protection infor free drinks and whatever  they could get were there when we ed. Another of the locals, Billy Haward, was having it off with the we of one of our mechanics at Atlantic Machines, and he thought it was personal. We couldn’t give a f**k who he was shagging – unless it got in the way of our business – but it had him on edge. There was Frank and I, Harry Rawlins, Ronnie Jeffreys and Billy Staynton, in our little drinks party. I saw the other blokes, they were familiar but on nodding terms: Billy Haward, Billy Gardiner, Henry Botton, and Peter Hennessy.    At that point, around  pm, I never imagined it was going to turn out like the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but it did. Maybe not in so many dead, but in the legend of London gangland it was the beginning of the end of an era. I’ll try and do it justice but it happened quickly. I got the shotgun treatment. I’ve got a load of pellets in my leg half a century and more later. I’ve had a knee replacement, and when they X-rayed my knee, the technician asked: ‘What’s all that ’ It’s still there. As is my memory. The atmosphere was tense and I tried to lighten the evening up, kept the drinks coming. I’d talked to the management and our deal was done. We were in charge of security and good order in the club. And, then, Jimmy Moody, who I knew but who was a friend of Harry Rawlins, came in and joined us for a drink. The paranoid Billy Haward panicked, for he knew Moody was someone who could make problems vanish, in a puff of smoke, as it were. [Jimmy Moody became a multiple killer and IRA hitman and was himself assassinated on  June  at the Royal Hotel, by Victoria Park, Hackney, East London. That Tuesday evening the pub, Moody’s ‘local’, was quiet at  pm when his killerwandered in, ordered a pint of Foster’s lager, and put two one-pound coins on the bar. Without touching his drink, he stood away from the bar, turned and shot four bullets from a Webley . revolver into the -stone body of Moody.  The execution over, the gunman calmly left the pub and drove off in a white Ford Fiesta. He was never caught.] Haward was joined by his other mate, Dickie Hart, just out of jail for GBH, and they sent out for tools, for guns. Hart got a . pistol and Haward a sawn-off . double-barrelled shotgun, cut down to the size of a big handgun. He believed he was the boss being tooled up in the place he thought of as his HQ. It never had been anything to do with him, and with us on a nice retainer it was startlingly out of his league now. When it came to the off, I had no idea about Haward’s love le or that they were armed – that Haward was better dressed than he looked with a sawn-off shotgun under his jacket, and Dickie Hart also had an accessory, an automatic in a shoulder holster. These guys thought they were Jimmy Cagney. In Catford. Although, the way things went down, it was the Wild West. To keep within the law the drinks had to be over by am and the management guys told me that Haward and his lot were refusing to go. It was am. I was being paid to sort that. I was restless and getting edgy. There just wasn’t any reason for trouble. As good as I could be, I leaned over, no verbals, and suggested it was time to call it a night, the staff wanted to clean up and shut. Haward stared at me: ‘What the f*** is it to do with you ’    I stayed calm. I told him: ‘I’m running the door here from now on it will be my blokes on the door.’ Peter Hennessy was a big fellow and he went wild, he went off on one, and I could see Haward bringing up the shotgun. Dickie Hart had pulled his gun out. Harry Rawlins grabbed at the shotgun and hit Haward over the head with it but Dickie Hart shot him with the pistol, puncturing an artery in Harry’s left arm which spurted blood showering into the air. Hennessy yelled at me: ‘You, I’m gonna have a f****** straightener with you.’ ‘You want a straightener, you can have one,’ I told him. We went out to the dance floor and went at it. There were guns about and I expected a bullet in the back at any moment. Hennessy was a big bloke and he was relentless. He was landing them on me – good, solid punches – but the more he connected, the more he hurt me, the more I gave him back. I thumped him and he went down. I got astride him and I wanted to punch his head through the floorboards but he was shouting: ‘I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough.’  I was on a no-win with the guns but I won the fight. Hennessy was out of the game and I was breathless. When I turned around it was a bloody circus, the fighting had burst over into the back of the room. Frankie Fraser had leaped on Hart right after Harry Rawlins was wounded. They were fighting with Frank and a couple of others struggling to get the gun off Hart. Frank took a bullet in his side from Hart’s ., right through, smashing his thigh bone. He was crippled by it but still trying to get at the gun. Hart’s gun was turned on him and he was shot. I know who did it but I won’t say. Haward was smashed over the head and wounded with an iron railing. Ronnie Jeffreys got a shotgun blast in the groin and stomach. I didn’t feel it at the time but I also suffered a shotgun blast, all across my buttocks and the back of my leg. Frankie Fraser had made it outside but only to a next-door garden, where he’d collapsed. It was Harry Rawlins who was in true trouble. Jimmy Moody came good and got a tourniquet on Harry’s arm and I think that probably stopped him bleeding out fatally. The street was lighting up like a Christmas tree and we had to get out of there. Jimmy’s Jaguar was nearest and I helped him get Harry into it and we were off. Jimmy got out of the area and when we thought we were a decent distance from the trouble, he dropped us at East Dulwich Hospital. Jimmy scarpered when he knew the doctors had got to Harry and me. It didn’t look good for Harry who couldn’t speak and the doctor said was ‘in danger of dying’. He was on a drip right away. I told them I was George Ward, first name I could think of. I said I had no idea who Harry was.    The police had collected Frankie and Ronnie Jeffreys from outside Mr Smith’s and taken them to Lewisham Hospital. They’d found Dickie Hart comatose, lying under a lilac tree, and taken him there, too, and that’s where he died. As I saw it we were the victims. We’d gone to the club unarmed and not looking for trouble and now we were shot up. Frankie’s leg had been shattered by the . bullet and my leg had ballooned up with lead poisoning.Harry Rawlins was all but dying in the hospital bed next to me. But, of course, the police appeared like bad weather when you don’t need it.Neither Harry or I were able to move far, but two coppers were put on duty to guard the side ward we were in put in. I was saying nothing, and announced that in front of the hospital staff as I didn’t want some copper making up statements for me. For the cops the total was four seriously wounded, one dead: it was the start and the end all at once. I was charged with ‘making an affray’ and Frankie was charged with the murder of Dickie Hart and stashed in the hospital wing of Wandsworth Prison. The others on our side of the trouble were remanded with me in Brixton. Charlie was in South Africa with Jean Lagrange, f**king her and, unbeknown to him or me, the rest of our lives. Still, when he heard of my trouble he got the first flight back to start fixing whatever was necessary. Yet, in the moment, that geography made Ronnie Kray very brave. I was in jail. Frankie Fraser was in a hospital bed in a high security prison. Charlie was in South Africa. Ron Kray couldn’t believe his luck. On  March , two nights after the gunfight at Mr Smith’s, Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell dead.

Kelly McVicker had tried every lip plumping gloss there is in a bid to boost her pout and confidence - but claimed none of them worked. Desperate to achieve her dream look, Kelly decided to take the plunge and get fillers. The full-time mum claims the £ offer for .ml of filler administered in her living room by a beautician resulted in a trip to AE after her lips doubled in size. Kelly claims she was left with blood dripping down her face during the two-hour ordeal when her lips were repeatedly punctured by the needle. The mum-of-five was said she was forced to hold a frozen gammon joint to her rapidly ballooning lips in a desperate bid to reduce the swelling but when that didnapost work she went to AE to seek medical treatment.    After ing home from hospital Kelly claims her lips erupted in painful blisters and her top lip was left much bigger than her bottom for three weeks - leaving her looking aposlike a duckapos and forced to hide away at home. The -year-old has vowed never to get lip fillers done again and believes her lips are still disfigured from the procedure. Now Kelly is speaking out in a bid to warn others of the dangers of getting lip fillers from anyone other than medically qualied professionals. Kelly, from West Yorkshire, said: My top lip was way bigger than my bottom, it looks like Iaposve got a horrendous duck lip and Iaposm really conscious of it. I stayed indoors for three weeks and the few times I went out, on the school run, I would put a scarf over my lips. I just felt like people were looking at me - especially my top lip that was double the size of my bottom one. I still canapost go out without thinking people are looking and laughing.The treatment was booked through through a beauty and aesthetics page on Facebook that has since been deleted.The woman, who assured Kelly she was qualied when she booked it and was doing the offer for her portfolio, set up her equipment and began the painful procedure. Kelly said: I booked the filler as a confidence boost. I tried every lip plumping gloss there is but it just didnapost work.    I didnapost expect her to cause that much trauma and blood during the treatment. Blood was pouring down my face and as she went across my lips it felt like my lips were getting punctured. Every injection she went did went deep into the lip and at times I was worried it would come all the way through. It was painful but at first I could take it, as she did more and more it go to the stage my legs were jumping with the pain. She was at my house for a good couple of hours. Iaposd never had it done before so I just thought it was normal and that she knew what she was doing. The following day Kelly continued to message the beautician for advice who offered to drive her an hour down the motorway to a pal in Huddersfield who could dissolve the filler. Kelly said: During the treatment the lady who did it said that she needed some ice for my lips but I didnapost have any. I told her aposIaposve only got a joint of meatapos and she told me to grab that. She told me not to worry and that in a couple of days my lips would be perfect. I looked in the mirror and thought aposoh my god what am I going to do apos    They were getting bigger and bigger and i could hardly talk because they were so sore and swollen, it was horrendous. After she left I cried, I was scared and hysterical because of the pain and how they looked. I messaged her to say I was worried and after two hours she messaged me back saying aposI think you need to get them checkedapos. She said her friend could remove them and picked me up the following day. I had to keep the frozen gammon joint on my face all the way there as my lips were absolutely huge and were purple.The beautician said she wasnapost happy with my blood pressure and advised me to go to my local AE.Kelly was driven to Pinderfields Hospitalaposs AE department where shocked doctors examined her black and blue lips and sent her home with steroids. The following day Kelly was driven back to the beautician in Huddersfield who was only able to dissolve some of the product leaving her with lumpy lips - and her top lip double the size of the bottom one. The beautician was contacted for comment but failed to respond. She has removed their businessapos Facebook page since Kellyaposs complaint.

David, who is still running on adrenaline a week after the birth, told The Record: I was sleeping downstairs with my phone on silent not knowing what was going on in the bathroom.    Itaposs still a bit of a blur, but I think I was woken up by screaming or crying. When he got to the bathroom Stacey ordered him to call  immediately. David, a commercial sales representative at Certas Energy, still clearly flustered by what had just happened was told to pack an overnight bag for Stacey. He said: I didnapost have a clue what to do, I was all over the place. The paramedic told me to pack a bag but for some reason I was looking for clothes in the fridge. I still canapost explain the emotions I was going through at that moment. Stacey added: It all happened so quickly.

It was a quick birth and David woke up just minutes after I had delivered her. People have asked me what emotions I was going through at the time but it was all just a blur, it wasnapost until after that I thought my le had just turned round. The surprise birth came after Stacey had being living a normal le, eating and drinking whatever and whenever she liked. Throughout the nine months she was pregnant she was still experiencing regular periods and taking the birth control pill. And over the Christmas and New Year period the couple took a trip to Thailand where Stacey ate and drank what she liked. Alcohol and long haul flights are two of the many things that doctors tell pregnant mums to avoid.    Stacey said: I was just doing what I normally do. Not having a lot of wine but just when we went out for dinner and things.I had a bit of heartburn when I was away but I thought that was just the spicy food.It wasnapost until after giving birth that I found out babies with lots of hair give you heartburn. David said the doctors and paramedics were astonished that Stacey didnapost have a clue she was pregnant. He said: The paramedics hadnapost dealt with a birth like this before so they were in as much shock as us. I think they were concerned when they arrived at the house. Thankfully after a couple of tests at the hospitalthe doctors said Stacey and Sophia were perfectly fine.    Itaposs a miracle that despite not knowing she was pregnant and living a normal le we have a healthy baby. We canapost thank the paramedics who came to the house and the doctors at the hospital, they were amazing. It was nice that a day after being released from hospital one of the paramedics came to see us to see how things were. On le as a mum and dad, David said: We have adjusted and adapted, you have to. But we are lucky that our family and friends have been amazing and supported us since the birth. Itaposs nothing we were prepared for whatsoever but we are learning as the days go on.

She said: “My husband Michael, who works in travel destination marketing, was abroad at the time, so I went to the hospital appointment on my own, expecting the tests to show I had haemorrhoids or piles.    “I was nervous but not really worried, until the consultant said he hadn’t expected to find what he discovered, which was a small lump measuring just over an inch. “He told me it had nothing to do with the pregnancy and took a biopsy, after which I had to wait for  days for the next appointment with the colorectal, or colon specialists, at Derrord Hospital in Plymouth. “It was a strange time. I went through lots of emotions but eventually felt quite peaceful thinking whatever happens happens. To Simaaposs horror, when she and Michael, , went to her follow-up appointment, with her by then  weeks pregnant with her daughter, Mathilda, now three, the doctor told them: Itaposs cancer. The biopsy had revealed a stage three cancerous tumour, which had embedded itself into the intestinal wall. “It’s like having a pause button on your le when you hear those words,” said Sima. “We were all taken aback, including the doctors and the nurses. My husband cried and I felt something drop in the pit of my stomach.    “The doctors told me it is very rare for someone of my age – I was  then – to have this cancer and that there were no more tests that could be done until after Iaposd given birth. I would need major surgery and a colostomy - erting my waste into a stoma bag. But before any of that could happen, I would have to have my baby. “The doctors made it clear there was no choice about this and left Michael and I alone in the room for a while with a box of tissues. Just five days later, on  September , Mathilda was born at Derrord Hospital by caesarean, weighing lbs oz, leaving both Sima and Michael feeling they had been robbed of the joys of a normal delivery and natural birth. “It was surreal, strange and traumatic,” said Sima, “It was very, very dficult to become a new mother in those circumstances.    In a way, it felt asgiving birth had become a medicalised experience because of the cancer. “Everyone was taken aback by my diagnosis. It was shocking for everyone around me, family, friends and work colleagues, because they all knew I was a healthy person.” After Mathildaaposs birth, doctors gave Sima a couple of weeks to recover, as well as to spend quality time with their new daughter, before commencing treatment to tackle the tumour. Despite knowing it would leave her infertile and unable to have any more children, Sima followed the medical advice and had radiation therapy every day for a week, before having surgery a week later. “I had an abdominal perineal resection, which means surgeons took away my rectum, anus and the descending colon to make sure they removed all the cancer in a six-hour operation,” she explained.  “It was brutal, but we knew it was for the best. Because I was so young, they wanted to be as thorough as possible to ensure it could never come back. But it was becoming hard to untangle being a patient from being a new mother.” While her operation on October ,  was a major ordeal and the thought of le with a stoma bag was grim, Sima said her surgeon told her the operation was not about surviving the cancer, but about ensuring she would enjoy a normal le span. “He told me it was highly curable with the operation and we had caught it in the nick of time,” she said. If I went ahead with everything they recommended, it would mean I would most likely live until old age, as normal. As doctors found cancer cells in Sima’s lymph nodes following the colostomy, she also needed four rounds of intense chemotherapy, making looking after a new baby very hard. She said: “The chemotherapy knocks the stuffing out of you. “Both my white blood cells and platelets were low, so I was high risk for infection and was hospitalised with the flu during the chemotherapy treatment.  “It was a hard slog just to get up in the morning. My immune system was battered and I was running on empty. That meant Michael had to be even more hands-on with Mathilda, doing the night feeds and so on. It was tough on all of us.” Sima has now been pronounced cancer free, but as well as attacking the cancer cells, the radiation treatment she had at the start also destroyed her oies - plunging her into an early menopause. Since May , she has been taking HRT to compensate for the loss of the female hormone oestrogen, but she has struggled coming to terms with menopausal changes, such as rapid changes in temperatures and fatigue, as well as a general low mood, which a woman does not usually experience until she hits her mid-s to s. While HRT is often not recommended for certain cancer patients, as their tumours can be oestrogen responsive, due to Simaaposs young age and the fact her body would have been producing the hormone naturallyit was not for the radiation therapy, doctors recommended she started the treatment as soon as possible. “It has been quite tricky,” said Sima. “Last summer, I was suffering from awful cramps and nausea.  The doctors thought perhaps, despite the radiation treatment, my oies may have some slightwhich was causing that - but this has now settled down, because of hormone therapy. Luckily, Sima is now able to fully enjoy family le with her loving husband and their daughter, after cancer turned all their lives upside down. “It was very hard for both of us when it all started,” she said. “Michael wasn’t sure how best to help me and so threw himself into looking after Mathilda when he wasn’t working, meaning we were often apart. “If I woke up having a bad day after a round of chemotherapy it was hard for him to go to work and leave me, but somehow, we got by.” Looking death in the face so young has helped Sima to find her inner strength and made her determined to raise awareness of bowel cancer.  She said: “It is very sobering to have a brush with your own mortality at such a young age. “I do feel strong for managing to get through it all and I am now much more appreciative of what’s important - which is family and friends. I have also learnt how crucial it is for other young people talk about bowel cancer, which is more often associated with an older generation. It’s important to remove any stigma about it to learn to talk about uncomfortable things. “I remember feeling like the only person under  who had it, but it can and does affect young people. I learnt that when I watched the Never Too Young video on the Bowel Cancer UK website which really helped me feel less isolated and alone.”For more information see click here ."},{"url":null,"title":"nurse who had help london","story":"NewsNurse who had to help London Bridge victim stabbed to death by three terroristsAustralian Kirsty Boden, , was dubbed the Angel of London Bridge after the nurse was slain rushing to the aid of terror attack victimsShareCommentsByEmily PenninkNina Lloyd:,  MAY NewsAustralian nurse Kirsty Boden has come to be known as the Angel of London Bridge \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young woman dubbed the Angel Of London Bridge was stabbed in the head when she rushed to the aid of another victim after telling her friends Iaposm a nurse, I have to go and help, an inquest heard. Australian Kirsty Boden, , had rushed in after Boro Bistro waiter Alexandre Pigeard, , was kned during the London Bridge terror attack on the evening of June , . She was caught on mobile phone footage bending over the stricken Frenchman on the ground when she was set upon by all three knemen. The Old Bailey heard how Khuram Butt, , appeared to make a stabbing motion before Rachid Redouane, , and Youssef Zaghba, , also moved in.    The tip of Buttaposs -in pink ceramic blade was later found embedded in Ms Bodenaposs head. CCTV footage showed her clearly injured as she fled the carnage before she collapsed. Ms Boden had been dining in the restaurant with two friends, Harriet Mooney and Melanie Schroeder, when the attackersapos van crashed into railings above. She rushed to help casualties of the debris which had rained down on outside tables.   In a statement read to court, Ms Schroeder said: Kirsty jumped up and said aposIaposm a nurse. I have to go and help. I need to seethey need helpapos. Kirsty headed off and I thought nothing of it. The next thing I remember was hearing screaming and thinking to myself aposcalm the f*** down itaposs just a crashapos. Harriet was saying we needed to leave, we needed to go. I was saying we canapost, we need to wait for Kirsty.  Ms Schroeder said they ran away with other diners and she came across Ms Bodenaposs body on the ground as she ed. She said: As I was walking back to the Boro Bistro I saw Kirsty lying on the corner. I recognised the person lying in the floor as Kirsty because of her bright pink cardigan. I screamed aposKirstyapos and ran down the alleyway. Ms Boden had suffered stab wounds and was alive but unable to speak, she said. Ms Schroeder helped with first aid along with a GP who gave chest compressions before saying she was gone and there was nothing more they could do, the court heard. Witness Alexandre Colou said he looked over his shoulder and saw Ms Boden falling down as crowds of people fled the attackers.  He told the court he thought she had tripped before he saw blood everywhere. He said: Her eyes were moving wildly. She had dficulties breathing. I was talking to her and then her eyes stopped moving. I said aposstay awake, stay awake, stay with meapos. Gareth Patterson QC, for her family, said Ms Boden got up within seconds of the crash, thinking of others rather than her own safety. The senior Guyaposs Hospital nurse was right there in the thick of it when she tried to help Mr Pigeard. Mr Patterson said the tip of Buttaposs kne was found embedded in Ms Bodenaposs head, most likely from the blow caught on CCTV.    Ms Boden was one of eight people killed when three terrorists mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge and ran amok around Borough Market. Xavier Thomas, , Christine Archibald, , Mr Pigeard, , Sara Zelenak, , Ms Boden, , Sebastien Belanger, , James McMullan, , and Ignacio Echeverria,  all died in the atrocity. Their attackers were shot dead near Borough Market in less than  minutes.

Razan, , fled to Britain with her family seven years ago after her husband had a lucky escape from a car bomb under his office in Damascus. Her host is third-generation ­fisherman Bob Roberts, . He is a committed Brexiteer who thinks ­immigration should be controlled. We have asked Bob and Razan to meet today as part of Britain Talks, a pioneering project that asks people with erging views to spend time together, find common ground and discover the real people behind the politics.here to take part. The two are soon sharing their views on everything from business rates to Brexit , immigration and the unpredictable Yorkshire weather . Will they find, in the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, that they have far more in common than that which ides them Razan travels to Scarborough, on the picturesque but sometimes neglected North Yorkshire coast, to see where Bob lives and works. She heads to the bustling south harbour, from where Bob heads out at dawn each day in his distinctive red, blue and black boat, Capernaum, with a small crew to catch  lobsters and the odd crab. Bob sells them to shops and restaurants across the UK – a market that has been dominated by Canadian imports. Today he greets Razan in Arabic – learnt from time spent working in Iraq when he was younger – before passing her a le jacket and inviting her on board.  He tells her: “We’re in a bubble here in Scarborough – we don’t have much foreign labour. People have a duty to integrate. I worry about people who are radicalised coming here. “You see photographs of Damascus and Aleppo and think how the hell are people living there. “Once it’s stable I think there should be an ambition that theyand rebuild their own country.” Former Royal Navy submariner Bob is a committed Brexiteer who thinks Britain should leave the European Union as quickly as possible. He sees Brexit as essential to the future of his ailing industry. As they head out of the harbour, he explains the relationship between Britain’s fishing industry and the EU, which Razan had not been aware of before.  They make an unlikely pair – she in her white headscarf, snapping pictures of the horizon on her smartphone, and Bob in wellies and waterproofs, steering them expertly through the water. Showing Razan where he bags his famous Yorkshire lobsters, Bob tells her: “I voted for Brexit to end the Common Fisheries Policy, and so we can have control over our own waters. “Then we could build our coastal communities back up. As an exporting and maritime nation we should be taking advantage of our own waters.” Razan and husband Raghil arrived in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in  with their children Angie, , Yara, nine and Kareem, seven, and very little .  Razan, who is Muslim, was still in the process of becoming a British citizen at the time of the Brexit referendum in , so was not able to vote – but she does not want to leave Europe. She says: “I think as a general point it’s better to work together when you can. This feels like a orce and it isn’t being managed very well. It is very messy.” When Razan tells Bob about her food business, the Yorkshire Dama Cheese Company, his eyes light up. The two entrepreneurs quickly realise they share a passion for hard work and a pride in regional Yorkshire produce. Back on dry land the pair head to a local cafe, Lookout On The Pier, for freshly caught fish and chips. Then they walk up the steep, cobbled streets to his cottage, with its “Fishermen for Leave” sticker in the window, to chat more over cups of Yorkshire tea. Bob will make avisit to her a week later – finding out more about how refugee families like hers are working hard to make a new home, and sharing food and ideas at her kitchen table. Razan founded her cheese company after arriving in the UK and finding she could buy the halloumi that she loved. Now it is a thriving business, scooping top awards and employing local people at its Sowerby Bridge base. For Razan, the business is everything - her livelihood, her children’s future, and a way of creating a new le here. She says: “Being a business has helped me fit in more. I feel very strongly that when you are in a new country you need to give something back, to get involved, that’s how you get settled.” So when Bob visits, his first stop is the production centre in Sowerby Bridge. Razan proudly leads him on a tour of the small factory, explaining why she loves the area’s fresh milk, and her plans for a new deli. Then they head to her terraced home, a short drive away in Huddersfield. In her kitchen they prepare a tantalising buffet of their produce – lobster and halloumi - all made or caught in the last few days.  They are both impressed – Razan says the lobster is “the taste of Scarborough”, and Bob says he is a halloumi convert. A well as enjoying great food, they have loved meeting each other. But have they changed any of their opinions  For Bob, it has been “eye-opening”. He says: “A lot of people have a negative viewpoint about refugees but we need to be open-minded and embrace ­immigration. What’s impressed me is Razan’s ability to integrate and adapt, settling here and making it work.” Spending time with Razan has deepened his understanding of the refugee experience. He adds: “It’s been really special – understanding her plight, and how people overcome their problems. “Immigration enriches a country. But I do believe in controls. It’s all about controlling who comes in. “We’ve come a long way. We’ve got a lot in common and a lot to build on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"high achieving brit 27 fell","story":"NewsHigh-achieving Brit, , fell to death from ft rooftop after New Year partyAarron McKay was celebrating New Years Eve in Sydney, Australia, when he climbed the five-storey building and jumped as police tried to talk him downShareCommentsByAmy Walker:,  MAY NewsHis mother told the inquest she is still taking medication to cope with the devastating loss \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Brit leapt ft to his death off the roof of an office block whilst hallucinating on LSD and ketamine during New Year celebrations in Australia, an inquest heard. Aarron McKay, , was seen clambering up the entire exterior of the five-storey  building before throwing himself off the top when police tried to talk him down. The sales consultant suffered multiple injuries in the fall and died at the scene  minutes later. Tests revealed Mr McKay had traces of the party drugs plus cannabis in his system. Officers also found  laughing gas capsules containing MDMA stuffed in his underwear.    Australian investigators probing the tragedy in Sydney, New South Wales, concluded the party-loving bachelor may have become paranoid at the sight of police officers, panicked and then ran away from them unable to appreciate he was at a height. An inquest in Warrington, Cheshire heard Mr McKay, from Helsby, near Chester, had been a high achiever who worked in finance at companies across the globe including Dubai, Jakarta and Spain. In  he moved to Australia to work with his cousin who ran an employment agency in Sydney. He later started working in Melbourne in the promotions industry and had tried to cut down his partying but he ended up virtually penniless. He started staying with friends at an apartment in Bondi where he was making ends meet working as a DJ or selling utility contracts.  The hearing was given details of an inquest held in Australia last March which said in the run up to his death Mr McKay had told a friend he had been using ketamine and LSD tablets on a regular basis. During one incident when he took LSD at a music festival and became paranoid that the police were looking for him. The tragedy occurred on December ,  after Mr McKay planned to attend a party in Rose Bay followed by another at Balmain, Sydney where he said he would take two LSD tablets and some ketamine. That evening at .pm, revellers at nearby restaurants spotted him climbing up the exterior of the Telephone Exchange building at Balmain climbing on its external ledges and wire mesh covering the windows. During his ascent, Mr McKay momentarily stopped to drop a backpack onto one of the ledges before climbing up to the top and wandering around the roof.    One unnamed witness gave a statement to the Australian authorities saying: His movements were erratic as though not knowing what to do. Another said: He seemed intoxicated because he was swaying and seemed cocky. A third said: He looked as though he was not even conscious of the fact that anyone was there, he looked like he was either mentally disturbed, on drugs or very drunk. Police arrived at the scene and three officers were dispatched to the roof. PC Peter Hibbert urged Mr McKay to walk over to them whilst a colleague added: Come on mate come away from the edge we just want have a conversation.  When PC Hibbert was asked to describe Mr McKayaposs demeanour while on the roof, he told Australian investigators he was pacing a few steps left and right as we tried to speak with him and he appeared to have a very blank expression on his face. I guess quite upset. The Brit then suddenly turned on heels sprinted toward the edge of the roof before jumping. Australian consultant pharmacist John Farrar said users of LSD can experience visual hallucinations and intense emotional experiences, as well as unpleasant reactions involving anxiety, paranoid ideation and panic. He added: Some users perceive their paranoia as having a real origin, stimulating desperate and irrational responses leading to misadventure. Ketamine is used clinically to induce anaesthesia, and can produce a trance-like state. This is often described as a aposdissociativeapos condition whereby users feel as though they are watching a film which they are in.    Ketamine also has the effect of distorting a useraposs sense of time and space. These are both hallucinogenic drugs which when ingested together can augment each otheraposs inidual effects of distorting perception. The ketamines and LSD which Aarron had ingested would be expected to have caused signicant cognitive impairment, some degree of acute dissociation, and grossly impaired perception. In a statement read to the Warrington hearing, Mr McKayaposs mother Julie Robinson said: He was a high achiever and did well with his qualications. He worked all over the globe Dubai, Jakarta and Sydney, he was very good at his job. In  Aaron was supposed tohome for Christmas. However, he had a new girlfriend and went to Bali with her instead. We stayed in contact all the time, he would write or call. The last time I spoke to him was on December . He was fine, he had his girlfriend and he was about to go into a new business venture and he looked forward to that.    He went backwards and forwards to Brisbane regarding that business and he was buoyant. I was on a trip to Ireland and I tried to phone him at around am, as I knew it would be midnight over there. By that time, I think the incident had already happened. My sister found out and phoned my husband. I was still in Cork with friends and I couldnaposthome because of the bank holiday. This has been a terrible time and I am still taking medication to cope with the devastating loss. They were all out celebrating New Yearaposs Eve. I understand they were taking something and somehow he got into the roof of the building. Iaposve found it hard to come to terms with losing Aarron and I still feel his presence around me which gives me comfort.    Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Cheshire coroner Alan Moore said: There is no evidence he intended to take his own le when jumping from the roof of the building. The most likely explanation for his actions are the effects of hallucinogenic drugs he had taken which were in his system at the time of his death, most notably ketamine and LSD. The evidence confirmed each of those drugs has hallucinogenic effects, and taken together the hallucinogenic effect will therefore be higher. Aarronaposs cognitive and perceptive factions were impaired as a result of the effect of those hallucinogenic drugs. This is the unintended consequence of an intended act.

Ping Pongaposs owner Usa Nisaika, , went over to look and noticed the infantaposs tiny leg poking up from the earth. Usa frantically dug up the lbs oz baby and rushed him to hospital where he was found not to have suffered any serious injuries. The infant has been deemed healthy and police have arrested his -year-old mother on suspicion of attempted murder.    Usa said his dog - which only has three working legs having been hit by a car when he was younger - was a hero. He said: I have had Ping Pong since he was born and he has always been very loyal and obedient. When he was younger a car hit him and his back leg was injured. He cannot use it but he still helps me when Iaposm herding cows. Everybody in the village is amazed by what he has done now. He is a hero because he saved the le of the baby. Police began investigating and interviewed local residents.    None of them knew any pregnant women in the area but a shopkeeper said that a teenage girl had recently bought an unusually large amount of sanitary towels. The teenager was arrested yesterday and admitted giving birth to the baby boy. She told police that she buried him to try to hide the birth, because she was afraid that her parents would be angry. Officers have now kept the baby under supervision in hospital, but the girlaposs parents have offered to take care of the infant.    Nakhon Ratchasima governor Wichian Chantharanothai and Trairat Witthayanumart, the chief of the Chumpuang district, said they have visited the infant in hospital and he is healthy. Governor Wichian said: The baby is recovering and he is healthy. His weight when he was born was .kg. The parent of the mother have offered to take care of the baby when he leaves hospital but that has not been agreed yet.

Governor Wichian added: Police officers are preparing to prosecute the mother but she is also a child and we must consider her mind and be professional.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented.

This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures.

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes for fear of their safety.ldquoTherefore, I want to congratulate Police Scotland on raising awareness and educating drivers so that they are unlikely to reoffend.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cycle-planned-as-part-of-georges-legacy","story":"SIX months after a fatal accident cut the le short of a popular Melrose student, his family have formed a new

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-urged-to-share-their-experiences-of-transport-in-east-lothian","story":"East Lothian Council has

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  My clothes have few outings and get a great innings","story":"Such a scene could bring a tear to the eye of anyone who has ever been forced to bid farewell to an outfit as dear to them as their next of kin.

After her talk last weekend at the Boswell Book Festival at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, I heard she had encouraged her audience to wear their clothes at least  times before discarding them.

Most likely you are one of those thirled to a self-imposed unorm, be it office suit or jeans. Sadly, I am of that persuasion. When getting dressed I rarely dig below the topsoil or forage beyond the most easily-reached hangars or shoes. Clearly it was for people of this nature that Harris Tweed was invented.

Either that, or a reluctant shopper. While I can admire beautul clothes and those who wear them, I loathe trying things on. I do have one or two lovely pieces, but they are usually bought on a whim, often on holiday, when I am window-shopping at ease. Back home, on the high street, I find the deed has to be done on the SAS principle of going in under cover, and getting out at top speed before anyone spots me and advances to offer help. In terms of potential misery, the idea of hiring a personal shopper for a couple of hours is up there with volunteering to visit Mars. You might think online purchasing is the answer, but thatrsquos about as effective as trying to hit a bulls-eye blindfolded.The advent of Snapchat and Instagram seems to have accelerated the trend of disposable fashion, especially in those with serious social lives. Yet when newspapers trumpet the reappearance of celebritiesrsquo previously-worn garb, what hope for the notion that itrsquos the person inside, not the costume itself, that matters  Changing attitudes to clothes, and their purpose, is the real challenge here.The biggest culprit in most wardrobes is the statement piece, bought for a special occasion, that has done service only once or twice. Even when borrowed by friends, itrsquos lucky to have five wears, let alone . To address this problem there are, of course, places that hire out occasion wear. Yet they are not a cure-all.

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"“But we know the impact it has on children meeting the veterans who make Scotland’s five million poppies every year and listening to their stories, as well as getting the chance to make their own poppy.“We wanted to take that experience on the road to school children and people across Scotland and so the idea for Bud was born.”Funding largely came from two sources – £, from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and £, from LIBOR funds. Bud was also supported by the Celtic FC Foundation, Edinburgh Trust No Account, First Bus, Gordon Fraser Charitable Trust, Neat Vehicles, PF Charitable Trust, The Basil Death Trust, The Murdoch Forrest Charitable Trust and the Welsh Family Trust.Then came a decision on which vehicle to use.Gordon said: “Our initial idea was a bus but we later decided a truck would be more accessible and flexible.“We spoke to Brakes, which delivers school meals – Bud is the same model as one of its  tonne trucks.“The contract then went out to tender and we teamed up with Neat Vehicles.“Their creative team turned Bud from a drawing into reality. Hydraulics are used so that he pops out and doubles in size, giving us ample space to tell our story.”Exhibits include historical artefacts, interactive displays and the moving stories of veterans and their families.Visitors also have the opportunity to make their own poppy using the same methods as the -stong team of veterans who work at the Poppy Factory.Guests are then invited to visit the Bud website to share their story of reflection and hope, which will create their own poppy “avatar” – a visual representation of what the poppy and remembrance means to them.“It’s an extension to our learning programme and online resources, which are downloaded free of charge by hundreds of teachers every year,” explained Gordon.“Bud is very hands on though – there are even hands guiding people to create their own poppies.“Four framed portraits also come to le to tell the poppy story – Lady Haig, a modern day volunteer collector, one of our current poppy factory workers and one from the early s.“Children and adults alike love it – it really helps to capture imaginations.“Four veterans, depicted as cartoon characters, also tell their stories and explain how Poppyscotland has helped them.“And the kids love using the clocking in machine – just like our workers use at the factory.“They’ll soon be able to buy Bud merchandise so they can take a small part of the experience with them too.”Seeing Bud come to le has been an incredible journey for Poppyscotland.Gordon added: “I was blown away with it the first time I saw it six weeks ago, even before its final fit out.“In our near -year history, it’s a unique project we can all be very proud of.“The public feedback has already been very positive, both from pupils at St Denis’s in Glasgow and with young football fans in Falkirk.“We also had a lady on crutches who was delighted to discover the lt on the back of the truck – Bud is fully accessible to all.“Now, we just want to get out on the road. “We hope spotting Bud will become an eye-spy game with people sharing it on social media at #poppybud.”Bud bookings now open but please be mindful of logistics!Donations raised from Bud’s tours across Scotland will fund Poppyscotland’s work, helping veterans year-round.The charity raised more than £ million from the poppy appeal last year, allowing it to deliver support to members of the Armed Forces community.While there will be no charge for Bud’s visits, there is an interactive donation box on the way out to raise funds. Louise Mackie, headteacher of St Denis’s Primary School, believes it will be a big hit.She said: “Being the first school to visit was a real honour and I’m sure thousands of other students and members of the public will find their Bud experience as moving and thought-provoking as we did.”Bookings will operate on a rolling three-month calendar with the charity aiming to book visits in neighbouring areas. Gordon explained: “If we’re going up to Aberdeenshire, we won’t be able to visit Peebles the following day. “Ideally we’d like to spend several days in the north-east, before then travelling down to the Borders or central belt. “Logistically, that will make it a lot easier for us but we’ll see how it works in practice!”To book Bud or access the supporting learning resources for teachers, visit the website poppybud.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"charity team come together for meeting","story":"Over  people from across Aberdeenshire joined together for a charity gathering recently.Members of staff, board members and volunteers met at CLAN House, CLAN’s head office in Aberdeen, for its bi-annual meeting and for a day of learning and friendship.Staff members and volunteers travelled from Shetland, Orkney, Elgin, Banchory, Ballater, Moray, Inverurie, Turrf and Crimond to hear the charity’s latest news and learn about new initiatives.At the event, CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell shared the latest CLAN achievements, identying that the charity supported , people in , almost half of which were new clients, including  new clients who were supported by the children and families’ team.Staff members also shared the latest news from the charity’s centres across the north-east, enabling the whole team to learn from each other.Anne Marie Robson a support volunteer for CLAN commented: “The gathering is a great opportunity to get to know everybody and to understand the overall picture.“It’s nice to feel involved – it makes you feel even more passionate about what CLAN does.”CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell said: “It is important that the CLAN team gathers together when we can, not just to hear the latest news but also to share good practice and learn from successful initiatives happening in our shops and centres.“CLAN supports , people every year, and each client has dferent requirements, so it is vital that our team works together to identy the best type of support.“CLAN’s services in the community, at our centres and outreach facilities, are vital as people undergoing cancer treatment may not be able to travel far, so we work hard to reach as many areas as we can, bringing professional, caring support to those who need it most.”The CLAN gathering takes place twice a year enabling those working in outlying areas to meet with their team members and gain a greater understanding of the achievements of CLAN as a whole.CLAN supports those who have a cancer diagnosis across the north east, Moray, Orkney and Shetland, as well as their friends and family members.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

We have also worked with other folk in the community.#They have thoroughly enjoyed the project.

This is the second year that Britt Harcus has helped guide this KTHI project. She took the opportunity to thank those who had helped make it possible.#The KTHI need a big thank you for their funding,# she said.#Without them, this project would simply not have happened. #Sandy Firth, who came to visit the bairns and has been a great source of knowledge and inspiration for the class. I think it#s important that wartime stories and memories are passed on and not forgotten.#Kim and Robert Foden also deserve a special mention for their help in this project as well as Dave Gray at Radio Orkney.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A vote for the SNP is a vote to make clear Scotland says no to Brexit.” VOTE BREXIT.!Two parts of Ireland, the main bit run by the Dail,and wanting to stay in the E.U. and Northern Ireland run like a junta, a subsidised wasteland run by the rogues of Westminster. Is it little wonder the majority ,there too,have seen the light and want to stayin the E.U ,after having a taste for normality and democracy .Scotland has a rare opportunity in the Euro Elections ,to boot the UKIP nonsense out the door ,by voting for the Green party,S.N.P and Labour and making it six for Europe.Scotland has a rare opportunity in the Euro Elections ,to boot the UKIP nonsense out the door ,by voting for the Green party,S.N.P and Labour.What a good idea. Spread the remain vote around, that will show them. United we stand!!! Nowyou want out of the EU, go for the Brexit Party. UKIP with theirTommy thug is a nonsence, as for May, lets leave that for gathering nuts!!!Forgive meI am wrong here but did not the SNP campaign most vigorously during the Independence Campaign to take Scotland out of the United Kingdom and that would have resulted in Scotland no longer being in the European Union. Is this woman being disingenuous or is she just plain stupid  Does she really believe our memories are so short  Just why would anyone follow the SNP  Nicola Sturgeon being investigated under her own Ministerial code for her handling of the Salmond allegations and nothing at all can further legally be said. I think no messages need be said to May from the SNP, perhaps Farage would put the message across with a lot more credibility.#Scotland#s future lies in Europe.# LOL. They never stop, do they, no matter how often it#s pointed out that IndyScotland will be automatically out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on the same day that we leave the UK.This has been officially confirmed to the both the House of Lords and the Scottish Parliament by EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barrosoand his deputy Viviane Reding , respectively.It seems the SNP will also #drag Scots out of the EU#,they get their way with independence.I#ve just had a letter from Willie Rennie. He thinks the Scottish elections are on  May!Ian smears Nicola Sturgeon then claims“nothing further legally can be said” in his latest charm offensive. Apparently the ancient legal maxim innocent-until-proven-guilty doesn’t apply to women he judges “disengenuous or just plain stupid”.Ian must love his prejudices dearly to flaunt them in such unapologetically intolerant and illiberal clothes. Was he always so delightful Brexit, in short, is nothing more than the Tories wanting to disconnect the UK from the EU, and connect itself directly to the USA, purely for themto benefit from the privatising of most government responsibilities and duties of care to US companies. It is, regrettably, as simple as that. Brexit, was nothing to do with the greater good for everybody, but for the few who would benefit####typical tory policy, # look after number , and screw everybody  in the process #, political ideology.*If* the Tories intent is to disconnect the UK from the EU and connect it directly to the USA, why is everything the government has put on the table so far and fought hard to sell to the nation as #Brexit#, proposals that will KEEP the nation well and truly in the EU in all but name, but on considerably worse terms than our current membership As far as I am aware Michael, % of British businesses deal with the EU. However, this is separate from the business of Government, and its duties to serve the people and the country. It is well known the Tories would love to privatise most Government#s responsibilities and duties of care to the private sector, where they themselves would benefit. It is also well known, the preferred country outwith the UK, to takeover such responsibilities to be the USA. Yes, the Government has a partial responsibility to acknowledge a large part of British business deals with the EU###as said though, international business and Government responsibility are two separate issues.

Director Forbairt FeirsteAn open letter to all non-unionist councillors in Belfast:THE new Council is now elected. As we face into the new mandate it is high time to effectively deliver on the long-promised aspiration of Belfast as a ‘Diverse City of Equals’.The Gaeltacht Quarter Board has long engaged with Council but Council has failed, thus far, to break down the reluctance of some to embrace and promote the Gaeltacht Quarter as one of the vibrant, open and welcoming quarters of the city and as an asset for residents and tourists alike. Given the make-up of the new Council we would hope to see progress in this regard. Here are some points we would like you to consider.# Unionists are now the smallest combined voting block in Council# Unionists can only muster  votes# That is  votes short of a majority# Unionists can no longer block the aspiration for Belfast as a Diverse City of Equals# No-one now needs to do deals with unionists in Belfast to deliver for citizens in a non-partisan way# Parties can now develop and promote fair and equitable policies, which are Section  compliant, without needing to seek unionist approval or unionist votes# Parties can garner working majorities without allowing Alliance to play the role of arbiter# The combined Alliance and unionist vote is , two votes short of a majority# If parties continuedoing deals with unionism they must explainit is to deliver on voters’ aspirations or for other more expedient reasons.Combined Non-Unionist Strength with Alliance –  votes.Sinn Féin Alliance SDLP Greens People Before Profit Combined Non-Unionist Strength without Alliance  votes.Sinn Féin SDLP Greens People Before Profit "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christopher looks to the future at newington cu","story":"HAVING studied drama at Queen’s University, a younger Christopher McBride could hardly have imagined he would one day become a Director at Newington Credit Union.However, the -year-old accountant’s thespian ambitions exited the stage when he realised he “couldn’t do accents”. He good-humouredly reflects on his lack of accomplishment in that department as a skill he “kind of needed” to carve out a career in drama. Luckily, he has found both fulfilment and success not only in his day job in the finance industry, but also through his work at the local credit union.Christopher has been a lelong member of Newington Credit Union, which was founded in  by his grandfather, Sean Caughey. Since coming on board as a Director in December , Christopher has striven to make a dference in the local community like his grandfather before him.“My granddad founded the credit union so that the local community would have somewhere they could save money, where everyone could pool together their resources so thatpeople needed a loan then there would be that central community hub that they could use and that’s something we’re doing to this very day,” he said.“I feel the credit union is really important. When I was in England I spoke to people about the credit union model and they were amazed because they don’t have the same focus on credit unions.In the last few years we’ve seen the controversy theresurrounding payday loan companies with massive interest rates, but that might not have happenedthere were credit unions. People who would otherwise have gone to a payday lender can come to the credit union and get a rate where they won’t be exploited, which is very important. I wanted to be able to help the credit union by using my expertise in accountancy to help its development.“I’ve been involved with the monthly meetings where we look at how the credit union is progressing. It’s really to make sure that we are continuing to serve our purpose. I have started to get involved in the investment committee to look at what we are doing with our money. I’m also involved in trying to get more people to join the credit union. For me, it’s very important to get more people – especially young people – involved in the credit union.”During his short time as a Newington Credit Union Director, Christopher has overseen an upsurge in members following a highly successful recruitment drive in March – something he says he is “very proud of”. He is also spearheading the credit union’s efforts to bring in a erse range of volunteers to help develop the organisation.“I want to get more Directors on board,” he said. “I’m one of the younger directors on the board, so I want to get more people my age involved. It’s good to have people from a range of backgrounds and it’s a good way to get involved with the local community. I really wanted to improve the North Belfast area, it’s something that I’m quite passionate about, so getting on board has really helped me do that. A lot of people think thatthey don’t have a financial or business background that they can’t get involved, but that’s not the case.“I came from a drama background and became a director, so the only real qualication is that you want to help develop the Credit Union and the local community.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"church leaders meet stormont politicians","story":"LEADERS of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches in Ireland have held talks with Stormont parties in the latest attempt to break the political deadlock.British and Irish Ministers including Secretary of State Karen Bradley also attended the meeting on Tuesday.The delegation of church leaders told the Stormont parties it was time to demonstrate courageous political leadership.Archbishop Richard Clarke said: #One of the messages we tried to send today is that in a vacuum, other forces will move into that vacuum and take control of it.#And for that reason, there is this absolutely huge need to ensure that somehow, normal political le starts again.#Archbishop Eamon Martin added, “If we don’t sit around the table and talk, then what  ”Following the meeting, Sinn Féin leader in the north Michelle O’Neill said: “All of society has a stake in this process so we very much welcome the start of a broad engagement with wider society beginning with the church leaders that were at Stormont today and we thank them for their contribution.“We want to meet with a wide range of civic society, all the churches, the trade unions, business organisations, womens groups, language groups, the community and voluntary sector and everyone out there because this process and these institutions belong to us all.“These talks have the potential to restore the power-sharing institutions and that is the best way to ensure that the next generation benefits from the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.“We all know what the outstanding issues are. We believe they can and must be resolved so Sinn Féin will continue to engage in these talks with positivity and a determination to do the business.“None of the issues are insurmountable or unresolvable. Agreement can be reached and the institutions restored with the positive political will and support of all parties and both governments.“The way forward is through implementation of agreements already made, safeguarding rights enjoyed by citizens in the rest of Ireland and in Britain, and delivering good governance.”DUP leader Arlene Foster added, “Getting the Assembly back up and running immediately would be a courageous thing to do, a compassionate thing to do and the right thing to do.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eastwood optimistic at taking third euro seat","story":"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood says his party are in the “best position” to take a seat in the European Parliament.There are  candidates battling for seats in the north with sitting MEPs Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson and DUP’s Diane Dodds expected to win a seat following next Thursday’s election.A LuicdTalk poll, published by The Times, has predicted that Mr Eastwood would received more first preference votes than the UUP and Alliance in the fight for the final seat. On a visit to Lisburn’s city centre-based Atlas Women’s Centre, which is EU funded, Colum Eastwood told Daily Belfast that his party are “clearly in the best position to take that seat.”“We have had a fantastic response. We’ve set out to run a very positive pro-European anti-Brexit campaign because I think we have the most credibility in terms of being opposed to Brexit, opposed to the referendum happening. “We are unequivocal in our opposition to it. We think there is an opportunity to now send a very positive pro- European anti-Brexit message by electing two Remain MEPs and we think that’s key becausewe elected two Leavers that would be sending the wrong message as to what people in Northern Ireland think about Brexit.“It’s within our grasp. The was a poll a few weeks ago which had us in fourth position, there was a poll two days ago which put us in third position so out of all the good Remain candidates were are clearly in the best position to take that seat,” he said.He continued: “We want people to lend us their support, even just for this one election, to send a clear anti-Brexit message. People voted in  to Remain,  per cent. I think that numberit was tested again would be through the roof. People have watched the Brexit process unfold with horror they are deeply concerned about the impact it is going to have here, on our economy, our society, our peace process.

This busy stretch of the Falls Road has no shortage of eateries and past experience has shown that it takes real quality to last there but, luckily, quality is something Tuckers has in abundance.The Gaeltacht Quarter is a hive of business activity and is also home to St Mary’s University College, so a good rule of thumb when choosing somewhere to dine during office hours is to follow the local workforce and students. When my colleagues and I visited Tuckers at lunchtime on Thursday it was bustling with precisely that type of clientele. Having already tried one of their impressive sausage rolls during a passing visit on one Saturday morning, I had already planned ato sample some more of the items on their enticing menu.Upon entering, we were shown to our table by our waitress Nicola, who also happens to head up the business alongside her partner, Dale. The interior of Tuckers is brightly decorated giving it a casual and laidback feel. Illustrations and sketches from local artist Joseph McGuinness also adorn the walls – an enjoyable touch that was admired during our visit.Since this was my first proper Tuckers experience, I felt that having a go at the fry was essential. Universally adored, the fry is the staple of most good café’s and Tuckers did not disappoint. Simply billed as the full Irish fry, this sizeable offering had all the hallmarks of a classic. Two slices of thick-cut bacon, two quality butcher style pork sausages, fresh vegetable roll, black and white pudding and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg were served alongside the usual trimmings as well as a welcome hash brown. Given its sheer proportions, this fry is not for the faint hearted, however, with each bite as good as the first, I had no problem finishing it off.Across the table, my colleague opted for the burger, which was served with nicely seasoned and crisp French fries. While I was obliged in tasting a few of the fries, my colleague was unlikely to part with any piece of his burger. Served in a soft floury bun, the burger was expertly cooked – seared on the outside and moist on the inside.A no-nonsense club sandwich made up the rest of the order fresh ingredients properly assembled and served with a generous portion of fries.After washing everything down with several cups of tea, we left Tuckers feeling full and satisfied. The friendly service and wide range of excellent mains, sandwiches, pastries and deli items would be reason enough for anyone to pay this local gem a visit. Despite having opened its doors just six months ago, Tuckers has already established itself as a firm favourite on the Falls Road. My colleagues and I fully intend toin the near future, and I have already promised myself another fry at the very least.

female politicians admit they suffer from “imposter syndrome” in their jobs, and say more women need to be encouraged to enter public le..pushResponding to comments made by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during the week, both Alliance’s Naomi Long and Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald agree that self-doubt is normal for women entering the political arena.The Scottish National Party leader told her local community radio station Sunny Govan Radio that despite being in the top job, she second guesses herself.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon “Even though I have been in politics for a long time, I have been First Minister for four years, there will be days when I think ‘should I even be here  Is somebody about to find me out ’,” Ms Sturgeon said.Reflecting on Ms Sturgeon’s comments, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said that women are more prone to self-doubt than men.“I don’t think there is a woman in public le who doesn’t have that,” she said.“It’s to men’s great credit that they look at things and automatically assume they can do them.“Women look at things and we look at the one small part that we may not be able to do.“I hope as a gender we can discipline ourselves out of that, it’s important for women in leadership roles to be conscious that as we act and speak and manage our way through political le, that other women and girls are watching, and making assessments of whether political le is for them.“I’m conscious of, and I’ve heard this said about myself, a question of: ‘Well, is she really in charge’,  and people say that with no conscious analysis of how sexist that can be.“Some people have a tough time realising that women can lead, and bring a huge amount of public le, across all political strands.“There is a lot more women in public le now, but we always need more.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Alliance Party of Northern Ireland leader Naomi Long Likewise, Alliance leader Naomi Long said that she doubted her abilities when first asked to run in her party’s leadership contest.She said “I think women are conditioned to think they’re not the future leaders, and that’s something we need to try to reverse, it’s an ingrained thing.“Even the most confident of women suffer from doubt, and I’ve never seen politics as off-limits for me.“However, when people approached me to be leader, I thought ‘Why  What would I bring ’“You have that moment of asking ‘Do I have what it takes ’, then when I started to think about what I wanted to achieve, I realised that is leadership, and people have followed, and I’ve seen it pay off, but you do have those moments of Why would anyone listen to me “I think by nature of society men and conditioned to believe they should lead, and women are conditioned to think they should stay in the background.”Both women are key players in the current powersharing talks taking place to try and restore the Northern Ireland Executive, and Ms Long says the more erse the negotiating table, can only be a good thing.“I don’t think it makes a massive dference in talks in terms of negotiating style, whether you’re a man or a woman, it’s more a personality thing,” Ms Long added.“What we’re seeing as more women enter public le, is that men and women are very similar.“We’re all dferent, we all have our own quirks, we bring that to the table, to me that’s really important.“Diversity at the table only benefits, I’ve never believed women are more conciliatory, or more empathetic, men are measured too.“I know lots of men in politics that don’t fit the mould of what you’d expect, you have to encourage people to feel confident and bring who you are to it.“It’s effective politically, being yourself is your strength.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37879829.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/emaker_Press_B%2046.jpg","title":"dup labels sinn fein democracy deniers over partys opposition

The fate of the third seat, held by the retiring Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, is less certain.Speaking at the launch of the Alliance manesto at the CIYMS sports grounds in east Belfast yesterday, Mrs Long said her party is best placed to take that seat.The party manesto includes pledges to secure a peoples vote, keep borders open, protect the economy and support the work of the EU.Mrs Long said: \"The recent council election results, in addition with a number of polls and surveys, show Alliance is in prime position to not only substantially increase our number of first preference votes but also gain the required transfers from others to take the third seat and show the EU, and indeed the world, Northern Ireland wants to Remain.\"Brexit is not an orange or green issue and I am not an orange or green politician.\"In , people right across our community came together to vote Remain. I believe we can achieve better together and show that same spirit again on May .\"Mrs Long said she believes Northern Irelands third seat is going to come down to transfers, and urged voters totwo Remain candidates.\"In the recent polls that have been produced, we are literally within the margin of error, neck-and-neck with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,\" she said.\"The Ulster Unionists are the current incumbent, and its very clearwe are neck-and-neck with the current incumbent, we are in contention for that seat.\"Unlike the Ulster Unionists who are moving backwards, and the SDLP who have been drting backwards, we have forward momentum, so the opportunity is there for us to attract crucial transfers because that is what will decide the last seat, not just the first preference votes but how many transfers we can draw from across the board,\" she said.\"Thats why I am encouraging people who vote Alliance to vote for other pro-remain candidates after they have voted Alliance number one, and I would hope that other pro-Remain candidates will want to do the same.\"Its important we have two voices in Europe who are pro-Remain, who are making a strong statement to government about how Northern Ireland feels about the EU,\" the Alliance leader said.\"But I believe it is also important that we have a voice there that is not simply a unionist or nationalist voice, that doesnt further polarise this issue but that can represent the broad swathe of public opinion and civic society. And I believe I am best placed to do that.\"Alliance’s key manesto prioritiesReinforcing progressive values. Alliance said it believes in “strength through ersity, respecting people, enabling opportunities, protecting rights and inclusion”.Supporting work of the EU. The manesto states Northern Ireland’s participation in the EU brings huge advantages.Protecting our economy. It says the Customs Union and Single Market “provide massive economic opportunities to our manufacturing, agri-food and service sectors”.Keeping open borders. Alliance believes any form of Brexit risks new isions and barriers, adding: “We must keep the open borders throughout these islands, and preserve everyone’s freedom to trade and live their lives freely.” Securing a people’s vote. Alliance wants a fresh referendum, with Remain on the ballot.

The film tells the story of -year-olds, Conchita Gonzalez, Jacinta Gonzalez, and Maria Loli Mazon and -year-old Maria Cruz Gonzalez, who were all from poor families living in San Sebastian de Garabandal, in the Santander Province, and who had been playing together on the outskirts of the town on the evening of June , , when they claim that they heard a loud noise and saw the bright figure of St Michael the Archangel.They said that the Archangel appeared to them again, in the same place, in the days that followed, announcing to them that they would see Our Lady on July . After this first encounter, the girls claimed to have over , visits from Our Lady of Mount Carmel, referred to as such because the girls said that her appearance and dress looked like portrayals of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.The film also portrays the struggle that the village’s parish priest, Fr Valentin, and Civil Guard brigadier, Mr Juan Alez Seco found themselves in to find out the truth, while confronting a perplexed hierarchy and facing an ever growing multitude of people arriving at the village in search of answers.The girls reported that the purpose of the visitations was to call for a “conversion of heart”, and that they had received two messages, one on October , , directly from Our Lady and the other via St Michael on June , . The visionaries also claimed that Our Lady had told them of a “warning”, a “miracle” and a “punishment”,the call to conversion was not heeded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe warning is described as a momentary stopping of time around the world, with all people then seeing the spiritual condition of their souls, and how they should amend their ways. Within a year of this, it is reported that the miracle will take place, which will leave a permanent sign in Garabandal – one that can be seen and photographed, but not touched. While the reported apparitions have not been approved by the Church, authorities maintain a conservative attitude towards them. In accordance with usual procedure concerning claimed visitations, the local bishop has primary jurisdiction. Past practice regarding approved apparitions indicates that in the absence of clear supernatural proof, neither the local bishop nor Rome is likely to approve an apparition.Following two committees convened by the bishops of Santander, they declared that there were no phenomena capable of authenticating the facts as undoubtedly supernatural, but they did not condemn the message. The first commission stated: “We find nothing in need of ecclesiastical censure or condemnation, neither in the doctrine nor in the spiritual recommendations supposedly addressed to the faithful.” On his retirement, Bishop Juan Antonio del Val, who called the second commission, stated that “the message of Garabandal was important and theologically correct”.Brunswick Cinebowl is located at Brunswick Lane, Pennyburn Industrial Estate, Derry. Bookings for the film will be taken from Wednesday, May . The Box Office can be contacted on  .  The film will also be screened in Cookstown, in The Ritz Multiplex, - Burn Road, on Sunday, May , with moves being made for it to be shown in Belfast too.One of the actors in the film will be in attendance at the launch.Juan Romero plays the role of the Jesuit priest, Fr.

Therersquos a team of around  of us at the practice and they are all brilliant.While Jane collected the Young Clinician of The Year award, one of the most sought-after accolades in Scottish dentistry, her practice was also shortlisted for the dental team of the year award, narrowly missing out on the night.A major part of Janersquos success is her ability to reassure young children and other nervous patients.She says that half are affected by previous poor experiences where, while the other % simply have an irrational fear.She said: ldquoWith kids I want to do anything I can to put them at ease so that in the future they will always see visiting the dentist as a positive experience.ldquoI will do whatever it takes, eventhat means having a tea party on the floor to persuade a child to hop into the seat. And Irsquove lost count of the number of treatments Irsquove performed on teddies.Elsewhere, Jane has also become the go-to dentist in the Highlands for working with autistic children after her name was shared repeatedly across Facebook groups set up by parents of children on the autism spectrum.Having grown up in Ballynahinch, she says that her love of the Irish lsquocraicrsquo has also helped her build a powerful rapport with patients by chatting about their families, hobbies, interests and personal lives.She explained: ldquoOne of my best successes was a young bride-to-be whorsquod damaged her teeth in a car accident. She was already nervous about getting in the chair and the fact her big day was coming up made it even worse.ldquoIt was round the time I was planning my own wedding, so I knew exactly how important wedding photos would be.ldquoIt was challenging because she was so nervous. But we overcame that and also got a brilliant result on her teeth with a combination of really nice white fillings, a couple of crowns and a wee bit of Invisalign braces to do a bit of straightening.ldquoNot only did she look absolutely beautul for her wedding, but six months later she was back for her next check-up, hopped into the chair and was totally relaxed. That was so rewarding to see.Jane met her husband, Martin Hier, while undergoing punishing training at a gym in Inverness. The couple both regularly compete in triathlons and Iron Man events.As well as working full-time, Jane is also studying towards a diploma ndash and a later a masterrsquos degree ndash in restorative dentistry.

Now these bad experiences are to surface again. And all in a strange and frightening environment. Our role is to give them the best support we can and deliver a caring and professional service.ldquoSome young witnesses appear to be calm. Others arrive visibly distressed. Some may appear totally indferent. In common though, they all have inner fears. I have heard young witnesses say they just want to get the day, or days, over, put it all behind them, move on.Judith said days at court can be long, intensive and wearing, explaining thatand when the time comes to give evidence, the young witnesses are now faced with their greatest fear mdash that of giving evidence.She explained how when the time came for the young witness to give evidence, it would be just the two of them alone in a room with a video-link.ldquoI must be a strong, quiet presence and remain so even when hearing harrowing evidence, said Judith. ldquoThis highly-charged time in the video-link room can be sharp, splintering and painful.ldquoWhen that ordeal is finally over the young witness can sometimes stay with us waiting to hear a judgement. This may bring relief, or, bring unwelcome news. Emotions can be mixed and unpredictable.Judith said she regretted the ordeals and traumas that the young witness had to face but marvels at their bravery and strength, adding: ldquoIt is truly a privilege to support these young people.Anyone interested in volunteering for the Young Witness Service is asked to contact Billy Eagleson on    or email billy.eagleson@nspcc.org.uk.

However, all three are capable of handling the big occasion and they could well form the basis of the Down defence.In attack, Down should have Glasdrummanrsquos Connaire Harrison fully fit again and his partnership with Burrenrsquos Donal OrsquoHare is central to Tallyrsquos aspirations.This duo have the ability to unlock any defence and the task of supplying them with good ball could fall to McKernan, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin and brothers Jerome and Ryan Johnston, and Clonduffrsquos Barry OrsquoHagan.Kieran McGeeney, now in his fth year in charge at Armagh, was able to get Armagh to hold their own in Division , but the Orchard County, although doing well in the Qualiers, have yet to win a game in Ulster under their former captain.Theof Stefan Campbell and Jamie Clarke this season and Rian OrsquoNeillrsquos arrival gives the Armagh a serious cutting edge and they could just be too sharp for Down to handle.The last time Down played Armagh in the Ulster Championship was only two years ago and the job of nullying Clarkersquos influence on the game was handed to Darren OrsquoHagan mdash a marking job that enabled Down to record a notable win.ldquoGoing into that game Oisin McConville was saying that Armagh had one of the best full-forward lines in the country and yet they were still in Division , the Down captain said.Sundayrsquos game canrsquot come quick enough for the Clonduff man and he expects a tough, hard-hitting encounter and fireworks from start to finish.ldquoItrsquos a local derby. Therersquos definitely no love lost. Itrsquos real. People probably think itrsquos not, but here has to be that hatred there, he remarked.ldquoItrsquos like Clonduff playing Kilcoo. I know all the Kilcoo players, but once theyrsquore wearing a dferent jersey on the field you hate them. You need that mdash you need that bit of hunger. Thatrsquos why you play county football.ldquoI want to win. I love playing county football and I think Paddy Tally will get an Ulster title out of Down. I donrsquot knowit will happen this year, next year or in three years, but I do think he can build a team that could do it, he added.ldquoYou set out every year to win andwe beat Armagh it will be massive for us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down Council director Bob Arnott  ","story":"A FORMER Down Council director who was chairman of the Northern Ireland Kidney Research Fund has passed away.Mr Bob Arnott mdash who was in s mdash was heralded as playing a crucial role in supporting medical research that has helped to change lives around the world.He was also regarded as a beacon of hope for people who spend time on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.Billy Thompson, vice-chairman of the Kidney Research Fund, said Mr Arnott played a very large and invaluable role in the organisation from its very early stages.ldquoHe was so passionate about the importance of organ transplants and he helped to raise awareness of the importance of research and of organ donations, said Mr Thompson.ldquoNorthern Ireland now leads the way in kidney transplants and ranks highly in Europe for having the highest number of living kidney donations.Mr Thompson said Mr Arnott also played a leading part in growing the charity to what it is today.He added: ldquoOver the years we have helped to fund research which has resulted in papers on renal failure being presented at medical conferences around the world.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shows how they continue to disregard survivors and bereaved through this process.The letter said the report will set out in detail what happened on the night of the blaze.ldquoThat involves an almost minute-by-minute description of how the fire started, how it spread and what was happening on each floor of the Tower, it said.ldquoIt also involves a detailed description and analysis of what was happening in the incident control room and on the ground, as well as the response of the emergency services and relevant organisations. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick has previously said he does not consider it appropriate to make interim recommendations ahead of the report.But some survivors have become frustrated that safety recommendations, such as abandoning the ldquostay-put policy for buildings over  storeys, are so far yet to be implemented.Ms Elcock said: ldquoIt is survivors and bereaved that fought to get dangerous cladding banned.ldquoThere is still no change to the stay put policy, people are living in tower blocks without sprinklers and social housing residents across the country are still be ignored and mistreated.ldquoIt appears, despite everything survivors and bereaved said in the weeks after the fire, the inquiry has woefully underestimated the catastrophic complexity and scale of the failures that led to Grenfell.ldquoThey also continue to woefully underestimated the needs of bereaved and survivors.She added: ldquoWe want the inquiry and the criminal investigation to be thorough and to get to the truth, but there must be no more delays.ldquoWe are living in a limbo, increasingly frustrated and we need to know there will be some resolution soon.

has retired after over half a century at the leading luxury carpet manufacturer. Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.
