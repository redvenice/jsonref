Indiscriminate shelling of major Ukrainian cities has been taking place, leaving hundreds of innocents dead. Mariupol, in the south, has been without power, water, or heating for three days as local officials say Russian troops are also stopping food getting in.  The U.N. human rights office says at least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded in Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The official said a 12-year-old girl, Anna, caught a train to Poland on Monday but in the clamour to climb aboard was separated from her aunt. ‘The girl boarded but the aunt didn’t make it and was left stranded on the platform,’ he explained.Speeding alone towards a foreign land in a carriage packed with strangers – and without a mobile phone – one can only imagine the schoolgirl’s panic, yet it is unlikely to have eclipsed her aunt’s.‘The woman was in desperation,’ said the official. ‘She was running up and down the platform screaming the girl’s name, not knowing at first if she had definitely got on the train.’ By the time she blurted out her story to one of the official’s colleagues, about 30 minutes had passed.An alert was issued and an announcement made on the train. A middle-aged woman on board made contact with Anna, and stayed with her until they reached Przemysl in Poland, where her mother was waiting, unaware of the unfolding drama. ‘It all ended well,’ said the official. ‘But everyone was on edge waiting for this happy outcome.’Russian forces, meanwhile, are bombarding parts of Ukraine’s railway network in what appears to be an attempt to thwart evacuation. Oleksandr Kamyshin, chairman of state-owned Ukrainian Railways, said: ‘We keep repairing our infrastructure but they keep destroying it. We keep repairing it and we do it under fire, but we keep running the trains.’He estimates the company evacuated 670,000 people from some of the worst-hit areas – along with 11,000 cats and dogs – to the west, either directly to borders or to cities nearby such as Lviv or Uzhhorod."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68f14b4a0b09a5716a697a9cf84911bd60832977/0_39_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=980f4b18ebb1afc7bec462df4378b6a0","title":"australia vs england icc womens cricket world cup 2022 aus v eng live updates","story":"Megan Schutt has the new ball and she is into England straight away!

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe whistleblower in the South Kerry Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (Camhs) controversy says he plans to leave Ireland reluctantly after being sidelined and ostracised in the health service here.Dr Ankur Sharma, whose concerns about overmedication and misdiagnosis of children were vindicated in an official report, says he is being treated “as if I’m non-existent”.The Indian-born consultant psychiatrist says he would prefer to continue working in Ireland “to complete the task I started” but adds that “no one will talk to me”.Dr Sharma has said the issues identified in South Kerry are not confined to that area and that there were serious problems in several other Camhs units in which he worked as a locum.“I believe everything will go back to the way it was before, until the next disaster unfolds,” he told The .He was due to take up a new locum post in Co Monaghan this week but says this was cancelled “at the last minute” after his agency was told the Health Service Executive had “potentially” found someone to take up a permanent position.His previous posting in Co Clare ended early, he says, when he was put on gardening leaving after making a complaint alleging racial discrimination. “My specialist skills are wasted. I’m sitting here, doing nothing, jobless. I’m so tired, but my conscience won’t rest.”Reaction of colleaguesDr Sharma says he asked colleagues in the College of Psychiatrists to suggest points he might make when appearing in the media but “I got zero emails and not a single colleague reached out to me.”As a consequence, he believes he is being “ostracised” by his fellow Camhs specialists.He said he plans to write to the Oireachtas health committee to be asked to appear before it. Earlier this week, HSE officials refused to answer questions at the committee about the treatment of Dr Sharma, who says he was asked to take time off from South Kerry Camhs after his disclosures and was reassigned to other duties.In January, a report found 240 children in South Kerry had received substandard care, and 46 had suffered significant harm. Dr Sharma had raised concerns about their treatment immediately on starting work in the service in 2020.HSE chief executive Paul Reid wrote to Dr Sharma last month expressing gratitude “for having had the professional integrity and strength of character to persist with your concerns and to insist that they be addressed”. Mr Reid said it was his “strong intention that all of our staff would feel not only professionally obligated but also supported by their employer to come forward where they have concerns about potential wrongdoing in the workplace. Bullying claims“It is a matter of great concern to me that anyone would feel unsupported when they come forward which, I am aware you have indicated in media reports, is how you felt.”Dr Sharma responded with a 10-page letter to Mr Reid setting out his belief that South Kerry is “not an isolated event” and an account of his treatment in the health service after he blew the whistle.Some Camhs services placed emergency cases, such as children who had suffered overdoses, on “priority waiting lists” rather than seeing them immediately, according to Dr Sharma.His letter also details examples of dysfunctional workplace relations and alleged bullying by management in some areas.He outlines how in South Kerry he was progressively sidelined, had his clinics cancelled and was relegated to administrative duties after his discovery that 55 children were on “harmful cocktails of psychotropic medication and lost to clinical follow-up” for years.He claims he was subjected to bullying, intimidation, harassment and invasion of privacy, and that his office was “ransacked” on one occasion.HSE officials told the Oireachtas health committee this week that an internal review of Dr Sharma’s treatment had begun, led by a human resources manager. On this basis, they declined to answer TDs’ questions on the issue.The HSE has also begun a review of the prescribing practices of Camhs units nationwide for children with ADHD.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire The Labour Party will decide on Saturday the arrangements for the election of a new leader, with the parliamentary group meeting with its executive board following the resignation of Alan Kelly. Mr Kelly, who has urged the party to rally behind Dublin Bay South TD Ivana Bacik as its new leader, stepped down unexpectedly on Wednesday following a heave by his parliamentary colleagues. The parliamentary party will meet the executive board, which manages the backroom and procedural business of the party. Speaking on Friday on his local radio station, Tipp FM, Mr Kelly denied that “backroom machinations” were behind his decision to resign the leadership. The reasons were concerns about where the party was going and what it was doing. It was pointed out to him that he did not have the collective support of the party which he accepted “straight away”.Several party figures have spoken of their surprise at the manner of Mr Kelly’s resignation, which followed unhappiness among his peers over polling performance and his perceived association with the 2011-2016 coalition government. There were also concerns over the culture in the party and the process around hiring backroom team members. When asked if he would contest the next general election, Mr Kelly (46) said he would not make any rash decisions. He would take “a week or two” to reflect and acknowledged that in the past he had said he did not intend to remain in politics until he was 65 as there were other things he wanted to do."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord labour s great unclenching follows clinical cancellation of alan kelly","story":"‘When Alan Kelly took to the plinth that night in front of Leinster House to announce his resignation, he looked and sounded like a man in shock.’ Photograph: Alan Betson It seems Alan Kelly’s leadership style left a lot to be desired, if a Labour staffer’s description of the mood in the party rooms following his clinical cancellation is anything to go by. As colleagues gathered for pints in the Dáil bar with their soon to be former boss, one of them started whispering about “The Great Unclenching”. Stress levels, it seems, were already beginning to subside and our happy confidant reckoned that massage therapists in the vicinity of Labour HQ and Leinster House are in danger out going out of business now that everyone is starting to relax again.The atmosphere in the party on Wednesday was very tense. The Three Horsemen of Alan’s Apocalypse – TDs Seán Sherlock and Duncan Smith, and Senator Mark Wall – had visited Kelly the day before to tell him the game was up. Senator Marie Sherlock was also a key player who “kept things on an even keel”. The plot to take out AK47 was finalised at a secret gathering of TDs and Senators in her Dublin home.During Wednesday’s Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, Sherlock and Smith sat directly behind Kelly looking distinctly uncomfortable. We would discover why a few hours later. When Kelly took to the plinth that night in front of Leinster House to announce his resignation, he looked and sounded like a man in shock. On Friday morning he did an interview with his local radio station, Tipp FM. He sounded like he was still in shock. Meanwhile, the Labour grassroots are rumbling about being left out of the process to select a new leader with the swift coronation of “Princess Ivana”, as some are calling her, seemingly already a foregone conclusion.Deputy Bacik has been keeping her head down, although she is due to address the National Women’s Council of Ireland rally in Kildare Street on Saturday and will be taking the plunge in Dublin Bay on Sunday at a Labour Women’s Swim to raise money for Ukraine. Co-incidentally, having finally made the breakthrough to Dáil Éireann last July after years of trying, Bacik spent the morning of the Dublin Bay South byelection count swimming off the South Wall with her mother Rina. As for the Three Horsemen of Alan’s Apocalypse, they seem set to form Bacik’s praetorian guard after her (unexpectedly) expected elevation. “Internal discipline will be required and that might not come from those traditionally seen to be closest to her,” said an insider.The drama was watched with great interest by the other parties. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians were particularly impressed by how the Labour crew managed to keep a lid on their machinations for over a week. In the bar on Wednesday night, requests were made for copies of the manual. Minister on paradeCometh the hour, cometh the Green’s sash. All the legends are going to be in New York City for the St Patrick’s Day parade. Ireland’s loss is the Big Apple’s gain.Eamon Ryan will be the Government’s representative on the big day, joining the proud sons of the old sod (no fresh turf harmed in the making of Eamon’s parade) as they march down Fifth Avenue. The Green Party leader says he’s looking forward to the occasion.Also stepping out is the former tánaiste and PD leader Michael McDowell who has been invited to walk in the parade by the city’s St Patrick’s Day Foundation. He is this year’s recipient of its St Patrick Award “for his service to the Irish nation” and will be presented with a marble “St Patrick’s Swan”. We hope he doesn’t get a swelled head as a result of all this.Senator McDowell will be honoured along with the parade Grand Marshall, James T Callahan (General President of the International Union of Operating Engineers) at a gala dinner on March 15th in Manhattan’s Sheraton Hotel. It’s a swanky affair, with sponsorship packages costing up to $50,000 (about €45,000) for a table of 12 (Diamond Package) and reserved seats at $500 a head. It doesn’t look like Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald – a regular participant – will be marching this time. On March 17th she will be in Washington with Michelle O’Neill at the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill.The 261st St Patrick’s Day Parade in New York will mark the anniversary of 911 and pay tribute to the Irish-American labour movement. It will also recognise the centenary of the formation of the Irish government. Party – of the birthday kindSpeaking of McDowell, that erse half dozen known as the Seanad Independent Group held a surprise 50th birthday lunch on Tuesday for their group administrator, Samantha Long. She is also McDowell’s right-hand woman and he organised the celebration in the Members’ Restaurant. Given the make-up of this technical group (formed to ensure regular speaking slots and the right to publish Bills) it is very possible that Samantha has to control them with a whip and a chair. The other group members are Senators Rónán Mullen, Sharon Keogan, Victor Boyhan, Gerard Craughwell and David Norris. During the recent unveiling of a portrait of Norris, Seanad Cathaoirleach Mark Daly remarked that trying to keep manners on the Independent group is like herding cats. The group admin probably has to wear ear protectors as well.The six Senators and their staff toasted Samantha and unveiled a special birthday cake made by Oireachtas catering queen Julie Lyons. It was a Tuesday party for a Saturday birthday in a busy few days for the popular Leinster House staffer. Samantha, a Magdalene laundry adoptee, was one of the women who featured this week in the first part of RTÉ’s heartbreaking documentary, Ireland’s Dirty Laundry.She said: “My mother was Magdalene Number 322, real name Margaret. Margaret was committed to an industrial school in 1954, age two years and four months. She left 49 years later in a coffin.” Viewers will learn more about Samantha and her sister’s birth mother, Margaret Bullen, in the second part of the documentary which airs on Wednesday. Chips with everythingIf a terrifying war in Ukraine wasn’t enough this week, who suddenly pops up again only George Lee with alarming news about accelerating climate change threatening our very existence. Then along comes a story about false widow spiders trussing up and eating baby bats. And then Alan Kelly is taken out as leader of the Labour Party in a bloodless coup hatched in the home of a first-time Labour Senator. Thank heavens for Leo Varadkar. At least it seemed some small bit of good cheer was coming our way when a press release landed from the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment with the encouraging news that the Tánaiste has just launched “a public consultation seeking views on the proposed European Chips Act”. It is built on three pillars. The first – and obviously – most important one is “A Chips for Europe Initiative”. The second one focuses on “A framework to ensure security of supply”. And the final pillar envisages a co-ordination mechanism between member states and the European Commission which will include “monitoring supply and anticipating shortages”.Pillars of chips for everyone. Marvellous. Congratulations Tánaiste for this excellent public consultation exercise we can all get our teeth into. Obviously, there will have to be an expert group on vinegar, a potato symposium in Dublin Castle and a mediation process between the Rooster and Maris Piper factions. This is what real government looks like. Semiconductor chips? Used in numerous everyday products including smartphones and cars in addition to critical applications and infrastructure in health, energy, communications and automation and thus central to Europe’s digital and green transitions?Some women left behindThe Oireachtas Women’s Caucus held a face-to-face meeting in Leinster House for the first time since the 2020 general election. Circumstances could have been better for the occasion and we hear the atmosphere was a tad frosty at times. Feelings are still bruised over the decision by the National Women’s Council of Ireland not to invite female politicians from Government parties to address its big rally outside Leinster House on Saturday. High profile Opposition politicians including Mary-Lou McDonald, Ivana Bacik, Róisín Shortall and Bríd Smith will speak at the No Woman Left Behind event “calling for political leadership and change to truly advance women’s equality”. TDs and Senators excluded from the “Government Women Know Your Place” event seem to have pulled back from the row – but they are still silently fuming over what happened.The dispute over who was and wasn’t invited to speak spilled over to more general criticism of the council for a perceived lack of ersity among the listed speakers. The organisers moved quickly to correct the balance. On the eve of the protest, which is due to start at noon and last for an hour, the NWCI had a list of people who will grace the platform “including” 20 named speakers. That leaves three minutes per person at the microphone. Good luck with that.

Photograph: Eamon WardElected against expectations and thrust into the national spotlight, the election of a mother-of-six and a Protestant voice as a rural Sinn Féin TD should have been a story of triumph against the odds.For Violet-Anne Wynne and Sinn Féin, however, it has ended in tears and recriminations. She has resigned alleging “psychological warfare” and said her most recent pregnancy was used as a stick to beat her with.The charges – serious allegations by any measure – have met, finally, with an apology.As often happens when Sinn Féin are at the centre of a controversy and facing questions it would prefer not to answer, the party’s TDs who are usually regular fixtures on the Leinster House plinth were thin on the ground this week.Yet as with most things in politics, the reality of what is happening behind-the-scenes is much more complicated than first impressions would suggest.Some people were elected in the 2020 general election that Sinn Féin did not expect to get elected. It resulted in something of a culture clash between those candidates and the party, partially because of the centralised command structure.The experience recounted by Wynne shows a discomfort with the level of direction she believes she was experiencing.It has often – though not always – been the case that a person who wants to earn a seat in Leinster House has to spend years working up the political ladder. Such a route has its flaws, but it gives people time and experience to learn the ropes.The outcome of the 2020 election – one that surprised Sinn Féin, never mind other parties in the Dáil – meant that there were Sinn Féin TDs elected who the previous year had failed to secure council seats. In Wynne’s case, she was placed eighth out of nine candidates in the Kilrush district, securing 4.2 per cent of the first preference vote.Coming back into the Dáil on a wave of a victory after the election, Sinn Féin held talks aimed at setting up a government of the left, but this effort fell flat as the numbers were not there, as it rapidly became clear.Then the pandemic hit and the Fine Gael-Independent caretaker Government steered the ship for a time. The relevance of this is the following: Sinn Féin was unsure if another election would be called and in some instances they held off on appointing new staff, so certain problems did not become immediately evident to the new rake of TDs.This is the first flash-point.Parliamentary assistantsTwo sources with knowledge of how the party works say that in many instances, parliamentary assistants are chosen for the TD and a choice is not given. Many of them do not rail against it, it’s just the way it is, they reckon.In response to questions from The , Sinn Féin denies that, saying said that all of their TDs are responsible for the recruitment, employment and management of their own staff and while some look for help with advertising and interviews, others look after it themselves. “This is entirely a matter for each inidual TD.”Many of the parliamentary staff in question are bright and diligent and experienced. They also work long days and irregular hours.The issue, one source says, is that the staff member may be loyal to the party and feel responsible to the central structure. They are invested in the political project rather than the politician as is the case in other parties. The effect of this is to disempower the TD by eroding some of their power.On the other hand, one source who has worked at different levels of the party, including as a parliamentary assistant, says that there are benefits for new TDs as they may be offered experienced and savvy staff who can help them navigate the difficult first year in the job.Another source said there be can huge ambition among these parliamentary staff and that working in these positions is something of a “school for future TDs”.Housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin was once a parliamentary assistant for Donegal TD Pearse Doherty while Louth TD Ruairí Ó Murchú and Cork South-Central TD Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire also worked for a time as PAs.It is all well and good when the politician and their new staff are on the same page. It gets very complicated otherwise.On Clare FM on Tuesday, Wynne touched on this very issue. During her two years as a party TD, she said she had four members of the party at various points working as her staff, though two had to take sick leave.“They left me in a situation whereby I had no staff members for a period of three months. This was two days after I told the party that it was not a workable situation, it wasn’t something I could see being sustainable and I was possibly going to let them go.”The  understands that Sinn Féin was made aware by those same staff members that they had significant concerns of their own. It is understood they felt stressed and over-burdened, and that the working environment was fraught. The two staff members went on sick leave before being let go just before in Christmas of 2020, and the jobs were advertised soon afterwards.Sinn Féin says that the employment relationship is between the TD and the staff member, not with the party.“As their employer, Violet-Anne decided to terminate the employment of a number of her staff members over the past two years. That was entirely her decision and her responsibility. A number of those staff whose employment had been terminated by Deputy Wynne contacted the party for advice. The party advised them if they felt they had been treated unfairly by their employer that they should seek employment rights advice,” The  was told.Local party organiserWynne has also raised issues with the party’s structures on the ground in Co Clare, where there was no local party organiser to address inevitable issues that come up in any constituency.Sources in the constituency, and, again, no one would speak on the record for this article, say Sinn Féin has regional organisers who cover large areas or multiple counties.The organiser has a heavy workload – they are responsible for delivering on political strategy in the area, building membership, making sure constituency meetings between politicians and voters go ahead, attending meetings and providing reports.There are two schools of thought about this role, the first of which is that they are integral members of the party who problem-solve and smooth over tricky issues. The other is that they are overly powerful and dictate to local members.Wynne has raised other issues that the party moved to address on Thursday. She was told she was an “effing eejit” for becoming pregnant again and that she felt anxious about relaying the news. Sinn Féin said that comment was “unacceptable” and that the local member has apologised.The criticisms of structures within Sinn Féin raise many questions. One of these is: will the party appoint advisers the way it does parliamentary staff if it gets into government? When difficult decisions have to be made and defended (and that is the nature of government) how will the new TDs fare if they disagree? Will they find themselves battling against both their staff and more senior party members?Sinn Féin has suffered four high-profile Oireachtas defections in just 4½ years - Peadar Tóibín, Carol Nolan, Trevor Ò Clochartaigh and now Violet-Anne Wynne. That is a high figure for an opposition party. What would it be like in the white heat of government?Then there is the question of how the party approaches the next election, having high ambitions as it does. The strategists (somewhat understandably) closely guard election plans but there have been rumours that so-called accidental TDs could be de-selected in favour of more experienced candidates. One source said another option would be to run that stronger candidate alongside any TD the party views to be weak and push the votes towards the stronger candidate. If the second candidate still holds onto their seat, then that’s a bonus.And when the numbers are in, should Sinn Féin enter Government Buildings, the next conundrum: the difficult task of managing expectations."},{"url":null,"title":"one of the greatest ever mobilisations of nato forces now under way in europe","story":"Dutch armoured howitzers   on their way  to Bergen-Hohne training area in Germany for a week-long exercise. Photograph: Sem van der WalEPAA week after Russia invaded Ukraine one of the greatest ever mobilisations of Nato member armed forces is under way.About 22,000 additional Nato member troops have been moved into eastern Europe, bringing military equipment with them, while at least 20 countries – mostly Nato members – are supplying arms to Ukraine.Even before the invasion Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg pointed out how alliance members had begun to increase its presence in the air, on land and at sea.Now, for the first time, Nato has activated its rapid-reaction response force (NRF), comprising 40,000 troops, including from non-alliance countries such as Finland and Sweden.“What we have done over the last weeks and months is to significantly increase our presence in the eastern part of the alliance: in the Baltic countries, in Romania, in Poland, ” said Mr Stoltenberg on Tuesday. “We have activated Nato defence plans so we can more easily move troops throughout Europe – and we can further reinforce our presence in the east.”US vice-president Kamala Harris has spoken this week with all heads of government along Nato’s eastern flank and “reaffirmed our iron-clad commitment” to Nato’s mutual defence.In these calls a spokesman for Harris said she reviewed “recent and upcoming US and Nato force posture adjustments in Europe, including the deployment of thousands of US troops and critical capabilities to reinforce our deterrence posture and collective defence”.TaboosAs EU shock over Russia’s invasion gave way to resolve, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that “European security and defence has evolved more in the last six days than in the last two decades”.Until last weekend Berlin refused the idea of supplying weapons that could be used against victims of Nazi totalitarianism. But on Saturday Germany shifted and is now supplying – directly or via third countries – grenade-launchers as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft rockets.In 2011 Poland’s then foreign minister Radek Sikorski – with an eye on growing Russian tensions with its neighbours – said he found “German inaction scarier than German action” in Europe.A decade on, in a previously unthinkable move, German warplanes are flying armed patrols over Polish airspace. As well as refuelling allied jets over Poland and Romania – 400km from Crimea – German Tornado warplanes and a maritime patrol aircraft have been sent to patrol the Baltic Sea.A overview of member activity and Nato deployments across the continent.ROMANIA: 300 Belgian troops, 150 Dutch troops and a French NRF army battalion, as well as 12 Italian and six German Eurofighter jets.POLAND: Unspecified number of French Rafale fighter jets and German Tornado reconnaissance planes patrolling Polish air space 32 US attack helicopters to the Baltic StatesPoland15,000 US troops deployed mostly in the BalticPoland region, supplementing 5,500 Europe-based US troops moved eastward to Poland.SLOVAKIA: Additional 250 German soldiers join 1,200 alliance troops German “Patriot” air-defence system, manned by German soldiers, along with Dutch, Czech, Polish, Slovenian and US soldiers.BALTIC: 150 Spanish soldiers for Latvia as well as 30 Canadian soldiers, artillery \u0026amp electronic warfare units 100 extra Dutch soldiers, 60 Norwegians for Lithuania 350 extra German soldiers deployed to Lithuania battlegroup, bringing the Bundeswehr presence to 1,200 four French Mirage fighter jets and 200 soldiers for Estonia, along with 1,000 UK troops and Challenger tanks.

But that is hardly credible while China continues to support Russia’s war aims, and will not condemn its leader’s invasion.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that Beijing is concerned about the harm to civilians and “looks forward to China playing a role in realising a ceasefire”. He has repeated the Communist Party’s well-worn mantra about “the territorial integrity of all countries”. Ukraine has appealed to Beijing to exert its influence over Putin.Yet Beijing has avoided even using the word ‘invasion’ and continues to echo Moscow’s talking points, that the conflict is the fault of Nato, Ukraine, the US – anybody apart from Putin. But if China cannot or will not see what is obvious to the rest of the world, what possible role can it play as a mediator – especially when so many of its actions suggest duplicity?Hours after the invasion, Beijing lifted restrictions on wheat imports from Russia and is moving ahead with large-scale energy deals, including a new long-term gas contract with Gazprom. China also reaffirmed that its ultimate aim is to expand the use of its own currency, the yuan, in all trade settlements between the two countries. In the short term these moves will cushion the blow of western sanctions on the Russian economy, and in effect underwrite Putin’s Ukrainian aggression. In the longer term it will serve the aims of both countries to achieve financial immunity by building an alternative payments system to that dominated by the US dollar.China’s official media has also avoided calling Russia’s action an “invasion”, urging restraint on “all parties”. Social media has been less restrained, with nationalist bloggers, always allowed more leeway, cheering on Putin. The sentence “Nato still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood”, created by the state-run People’s Daily, became the top hashtag on social media platform Weibo. It refers to the 1999 accidental bombing by Nato of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in which three people died, and was viewed more than a billion times.Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are close personally – Xi once described Putin as his “best friend”. They made a big show of their partnership at a summit ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics – Xi describing their friendship as having “no limits”. At that meeting, Xi for the first time explicitly endorsed Russia’s demand for an end to Nato expansion.China does not have formal allies in the Western sense. It does not fit with Beijing’s sense of its own centrality, which is incompatible with an alliance system that might require obligations, commitments and a degree of equity. But it does have a hierarchy of partnerships, of which Russia sits at the top.Joint military drills have become more frequent, more complex and more geographically spread. They have gone beyond symbolic shows of camaraderie, increasingly focused on co-ordinating command and control and enhancing battlefield interoperability. The Russians also have the combat experience that the People’s Liberation Army lacks, Russian troops having fought in wars in Georgia, Chechnya, Syria and of course Ukraine. Historic animosities run deep – theirs is a marriage of convenience, but the relationship is no less dangerous for it. Putin and Xi share a deep paranoia about the West, and a loathing for western democracies. They are driven by historic grievance and victimhood, and a desire to overturn the western-led international order, against which Putin’s aggression represents a full-throated assault.In other words, Xi shares Putin’s aims. But what of his means? And did the Chinese leaders know about the invasion of Ukraine in advance? The most plausible answer is that Xi was told by Putin in broad terms, but not in detail – or he hadn’t expected Putin to be quite so crude. Western intelligence reports suggest Xi did ask Putin to delay any action until after the Winter Olympics had finished, pointing to at least some degree of foreknowledge.Xi now risks being tainted by association with the sheer barbarity of Moscow’s assault. He is left groping at a veneer of high-principled diplomacy, while unable to bring himself to condemn an act so self-evidently at odds with China’s supposed sacred principles of “non-interference”.Xi will also have been taken aback by the strength and unity of the western response as one observer recently put it, he would have preferred the invasion to have gone “uneventfully”. It is another article of faith in both Beijing and Moscow that the West is decaying, in decline and unable or unwilling to stand up for its principles. Yet western nations have been stirred by the shocking images coming out of Ukraine. Not only are Putin’s reckless actions galvanising western alliances, but the sanctions are broader and have more bite than many anticipated. China will be watching closely the fate of Moscow’s ‘war chest’, its foreign currency and gold reserves held by Russia’s central bank. They have been targeted by the west in what may turn out to be the most effective of sanctions. The reserves now total around $630 billion, and had been seen by Russia as an important buffer. Yet many are held outside the country and could now be frozen. China holds $3.4 trillion of reserves and will now be rethinking how to resist western pressure in the event of a war over Taiwan.The self-governing democratic island, which China claims as its own, is never far from the thoughts of Xi Jinping. As Putin’s tanks rolled into Ukraine, Taiwan strengthened its combat readiness and early warning systems. President Tsai Ing-wen warned that China might exploit the Ukraine conflict to step up pressure. Last weekend, the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up in blue and yellow, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, in solidarity with Ukraine.For some weeks now, the worst nightmare for strategists in Washington has been that Moscow and Beijing were co-ordinating their actions on the Ukrainian border and in the Taiwan Strait. At the very least it is widely accepted that Xi is watching the West’s reaction to Ukraine carefully as he calibrates his own strategy towards Taiwan. He may also be calculating that by supporting (or at least refraining from criticising) Russia’s actions in Ukraine, Putin may return the compliment over Taiwan in the future.Beijing has been trying hard to discourage comparisons. It argues that Taiwan is not a sovereign state, that it has always been part of China – though this no more stands up to historic scrutiny than does Putin’s rambling questioning of Ukraine’s right to exist. Perhaps the most chilling parallel is that for Xi and Putin, the futures of Ukraine and Taiwan have nothing to do with the people who live there.Russia is the junior partner in the relationship with China, and sanctions will reinforce this, giving Beijing enormous clout – particularly in negotiating energy deals. If Putin’s aggression forces western democracies to address their longer term reliance on Russian energy, then China will become its most important market by far – and Beijing will strike a hard bargain. Beijing may also be weighing the strategic advantage if the Ukraine crisis sucks US resources back to Europe and away from the Indo-Pacific.Against that it must weigh the cost of guilt by association. For Beijing, it is not so much what Putin is doing as the fact his tools are so blunt and so visible to the world. The Chinese Communist Party has plenty of blood on its own hands, from the killing fields of Cambodia (Mao was Pol Pot’s biggest backer by far) to the deaths of millions during the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward. It is a repressive state that uses multiple tools of coercion at home and abroad – but more cleverly deployed and not documented in real time in such chilling detail as we are now seeing in Ukraine.There is now a real prospect of China getting caught up in the economic and political blowback over Ukraine, and the signs are that it is now recalibrating precisely where its interests lie. The irony is that the strength of western resolve over Ukraine, if it can be sustained, will benefit Taiwan, serving as a warning over what Xi could expect if he invaded.Putin has put Beijing in a precarious position. The world was already growing wary of China – and the decisions Beijing makes over the coming days, its willingness to stand beside a pariah whose barbarism is provoking such global disgust, will shape global geo-politics for decades to come.Ian Williams is a former foreign correspondent for Channel 4 News and NBC, and author of Every Breath You Take: China’s New Tyranny.

This is part of their effort to cut off a range of information from their public, said spokesperson Jen Psaki.Nick Clegg, Meta\u0027s president of global affairs, meanwhile, said the company will do everything it can to restore services.”“Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,” he said in a statement released on Friday evening.The latest moves by Moscow was in retaliation for the social media giants’ discrimination of the state media, in a crackdown that has already seen thousands of middle class Russians flee the country in disgust over the invasion and fear of economic collapse.  “Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded,” the media watchdog wrote in a statement announcing the ban on Friday. As the BBC suspended its operations, Tim Davie, the director-general, said the new Kremlin law would criminalise the process of independent journalism. He said: It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation.The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. Staff will not be pulled out, the BBC has said, because many who have been flown in are not correspondents but Russian citizens in their own country.Mr Davie paid tribute to the work of those in Russia, and said the BBC would continue to report on developments from outside the country\u0027s borders.BBC website restrictedThe BBC website has been restricted by Russian authorities, along with a number of other foreign websites.To avoid falling foul of the law, media in Russia will have to parrot the Kremlin, which has banned the use of the words war or invasion to describe the conflict, and has claimed that Ukraine is attacking its own cities.Vladimir Putin described the Russian bombardment of large cities as fake news in a call with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor.Mr Putin added in a speech: I want to emphasise again that we have no bad intentions towards our neighbours.Novaya Gazeta, the Russian independent newspaper, said it would remove content about Ukraine from its website in light of the legislation. The paper said: Military censorship in Russia has quickly moved to a new phase: to the threat of criminal prosecution. There is no doubt that this threat will be fulfilled.Media inside Russia have already faced a clampdown, with the opposition radio station Ekho Moskvy being dissolved, and Dozdh, Russia\u0027s last independent TV station, being shut down.Moscow is reportedly planning to introduce martial law, which would allow authorities to ration food, detain foreigners and close borders.Russians who opposed Mr Putin\u0027s invasion are trying to flee before such a measure can be brought in.Anya, who declined to give her last name, said she had flown to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. She said she was devastated to leave but had no choice.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin\u0027s spokesman, called on Russians to unite around our president, after thousands attended anti-war demonstrations this week despite threats of being arrested.Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, said it would remove content about Ukraine from its website in light of the legislation. “Military censorship in Russia has quickly moved to a new phase: from threats to block and close down publications it moved to the threat of criminal prosecution,” the paper said in a statement.“There is no doubt that this threat will be fulfilled,” Novaya Gazeta said.Media inside Russia have already faced a clampdown, with the opposition radio station Ekho Moskvy being dissolved on Thursday, following the shutting down of Russia’s last remaining independent TV station, Dozdh.Moscow is reportedly eyeing the introduction of martial law, which would allow authorities to ration food, detain foreigners and close borders.Russians who opposed Putin’s war in Ukraine have scrambled to flee before such a measure can be brought in.  Anya, who declined to give her last name, told The  she had flown overnight to Bishkek, the capital of former Soviet Kyrgyzstan. Tired but relieved, she said that she was devastated to quit Russia but felt that she had no choice. She does have any plans to return.“It was the only ticket we could get. This is my first time in Central Asia. We would have preferred to come here under different circumstances but we had to flee,” she said.Russian economy to shrink by 35pcAcording to US bank JP Morgan, sanctions on Russia, including its banks being kicked out of the Swift international settlement system and Western businesses turning their backs on Russian businesses, will mean that its economy will shrink by 35 per cent between April and June.At a special parliamentary session on Friday to approve the draconian media law, MPs also voted on a package of economic measures they said would help Russian businesses weather the sanctions.Amid near-unanimous support for the changes, Lyudmila Narusova, a member of the upper house of parliament, spoke of heavy Russian losses in the conflict. She said she knew of one company that was meant to be 100 strong but “only four were left alive” when the unit was withdrawn.Ms Narusova, the widow of Anatoly Sobchak, Putin’s former political mentor, did not present evidence for her claims and said the Defence Ministry had refused her request to confirm the reported casualties.Russia said Wednesday that 498 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine and has not updated that number since. Ukraine claims that the true number of Russian casualties is far higher.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineSky News reporter Stuart Ramsay shot by Russian \u0026#39infiltrators\u0026#39 in UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"full force international law must now employed against vladimir","story":"More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london ready mayor john bercow","story":"How to explain John Bercow’s enthusiasm for appearing on prime time television?

The Department of Health and Social Care may have found the leaker – but if they have, will not tell us who it is.Officially an inquiry is still ongoing. But asked who was the leaker in a Freedom of Information request, the DHSC replied that while it “holds information relevant to your request” it is being withheld “for the protection of personal information”.

Mr Bryant and his two sons deny the charges. Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC told jurors that Mr Bryant was a surveyor employed by the trust and he held the power to approve payments.Around £1.1 million of the work was purported to have been carried out on farms and cottages on the Arlington Court estate and others at Lynton and Croyde between 2008 and 2013, while a further £700,000 worth of work stretched back to 2000, the court was told. Non-existent companiesSome of the jobs were described as minor repairs to walls or fences which cost just under the £1,000 limit and could be paid without any managerial checks, the prosecutor said. Any invoices for payments between £1,000 and £25,000 required approval, but Mr Bryant had the responsibility of signing off such expenditure, the court was told. The bulk of the payments were sent to companies called JR Construction and SB Contracting, but the cash was actually going straight into bank accounts belonging to his sons, it was heard. Mr Douglas-Jones said of the companies: They did not exist. They were merely artifices created for use in fraud.The National Trust thought they were paying genuine businesses for work genuinely done of genuine value.Mr Bryant is also alleged to have done work on his home in Goodleigh at the National Trust’s expense. Jurors were told that JR Construction was paid more than £1 million by the National Trust between January 2008 and January 2013, rising to £1.7 million since 2000. SB Contracting was alleged to have been paid more than £64,000 by the charity between February 2011 and October 2013. Dozens of invoices were submitted for labour including chimney, roof, fence and wall work, as well as lime repair, the jurors were told. It was only in November 2013 when other National Trust managers spotted an anomaly and realised they had never heard of the two companies, which had received more than £140,000 in the past financial year alone, the court heard. Perverting the course of justiceA separate fraud was allegedly committed by Mr Bryant when he had approved an invoice for work done on his own garden, which was then paid for by the National Trust.He is alleged to have tried to persuade a builder to falsely claim he had carried out the work, for which Mr Bryant is accused of perverting the course of justice.The National Trust operates as a charity independent of government, meaning it does not receive any financial support, but it does bid for state grants from local and central government.Its largest source of income is membership fees, followed by money brought in from properties and estates it owns. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paulette hamiltons election raises questions keir starmer","story":"I can think of more convincing arguments against revolution, chief among them that in a functioning liberal democracy it would be unconscionable and as anti-democratic as it is possible to be.

Perhaps they took notice of my colleague William Sitwell, who urged the change a couple of days ago. Well, it’s kindly meant, but, if I’m not being rude to say so, isn’t it a bit daft?Honest Clive Myrie has been saying Kyiv in broadcasts for days, so as not to seem like a supporter of Russian revanchism, I suppose. But he and his colleagues on the wireless tend to pronounce it keev, like a fellow Rolling Stone referring to Keith Richards.God knows I weep for Ukraine, but has it become a principle that we try to pronounce places we support as their residents do – and pronounce places hostile to us in a way that might annoy them? Few Muscovites can be angry at our saying Moscow. That’s its name in English (though some Americans seem to think it is like a moo-cow).Even more ludicrous are attempts to give a little local flavour to foreign place-names which are really English already. A prime example is pronouncing Munich with the last syllable as in Ich Dien. Actually, some people assume Ich Dien is Welsh, since it is the Prince of Wales’s motto. But it is German, having been picked up on the field of Crecy in 1346 by the Black Prince from poor old John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia and titular King of Poland (none of them now in Germany), who had been doing pretty well in the battle considering he was blind and 50 years old. This is a mere hint at how complicated verbal courtesy to foreigners is.Anyway, Munich is called Munchen down Munich way. In Ukraine they called their country Ukraïna, but no one in Britain feels the need to pronounce it like that. Of course, Ukrainians use the beautiful-looking Cyrillic alphabet, which only takes a short time to mug up if you’re keen. It derives in part from Greek and in part from the even lovelier Glagolitic script invented by St Cyril and his brother St Methodius. Saintly as they were, I rather think they are controversial in some parts of Eastern Europe, so if you are the sort to worry about what you call a garlicky lump of chicken, I wouldn’t introduce them into conversation among strangers.Another piece of verbal courtesy is to call it Ukraine now instead of the Ukraine. Search me. Who can be definite about the definite article? They don’t even have one in Ukrainian, but even out of good manners I can hardly go back over the preceding paragraphs stripping it out. However, that the can become a shibboleth of linguistic snobbery. Take Albany.Alan Clark had a set of rooms in this formerly bachelors-only enclave in Piccadilly and thought the decor shabby in the days when he was rejoicing in his diaries at having a million pounds in his current account and ruing the impossibility of finding a decent claret at less that £100. He called it Albany. But in The Importance of Being Earnest we find: “Mr Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany”. The Albany! (Like “A handbag!”) Could Oscar be wrong?The same goes, mutatis mutandi, for the Guildhall, the MCC, the Lebanon, the Sudan, the Wirral and, for all I know the World. The the is sometimes used to condemn the old-fashioned or the vulgar herd (you, or at least me).But I say that we are right to use the form of names established in our language. Difference from foreign languages is its very definition. I am Christopher and so is Columbus, though in Spain they call him Cristóbal Colón. If he’d set sail for London, he’d have called it Londres. Why not?And talking of chicken, there’s a breed called the Leghorn, as it came from Livorno. We used to call Livorno Leghorn without ill intent, and indeed if you type Leghorn into an online site for train tickets, the machinery knows what you mean. For heaven’s sake, and Ukraine’s, let’s not project the deadly bitterness of war on to our freedom to use English forms of names.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sage stands signifying end covid pandemic uk","story":"The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been stood down in a clear sign that the Government believes the Covid crisis is over.Although the group “stands ready if required”, it will no longer meet regularly – the first time it has halted its ongoing response since January 2020.The decision was taken after the Government acknowledged that Britain has entered a new phase of its response and followed the lifting of all remaining legal restrictions in England under Downing Street’s Living With Covid plan.The devolved nations have their own scientific advisory groups and are emerging from the pandemic on slightly different timelines.The  understands that the Government will continue to receive Covid advice from other expert bodies such as the UK Health Security Agency and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, as well as from Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser and Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer.‘Over-reliance on modelling’Prof Carl Heneghan, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, said: “The standing down of Sage signifies the end of the pandemic in the UK.“This is a remarkable turnabout of events given that just before Christmas, Sage advisers were warning infections could hit two million per day and were pushing for further restrictions.“The Government will need to review whether Sage is fit for purpose when it comes to pandemics, particularly given its lack of clinical input and its overreliance on modelling – which we now know is no more than ‘guesswork’ – and its tendency to fixate on a particular set of assumptions.”Sage was first established in 2009 to tackle the swine flu pandemic and has been activated 10 times since then. But it has faced criticism over the past year for over-reliance on modelling, which has been repeatedly shown to be wrong.In mid-December, Sage urged the government to go further than “Plan B” restrictions and reintroduce “more stringent measures” to cope with the omicron wave, after models warned hospitalisations could peak between 3,000 and 10,000 a day and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 a day.The advisers suggested reintroducing measures “equivalent to those in place after step two or step one of the roadmap in England”, which would have placed Britain back in lockdown conditions.However, after taking advice from outside Sage, the Government chose not to bring in restrictions and deaths peaked at 306 on Jan 21 while daily hospital admissions never rose beyond 2,615.The numbers are continuing to fall, with cases down 12 per cent in a week, deaths 18 per cent and admissions nearly six per centBehind the scenes, The  understands ministers have become increasingly frustrated with pessimistic predictions from Sage and are concerned the group does not fully take into account the damage to the economy, mental health and education from lockdown.Earlier this week, Prof Graham Medley, the chairman of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), a sub-group of Sage, warned that modelling cannot “accurately predict the numbers” and said predicting which of the scenarios would happen was just ‘guesswork’.Responding to the news that Sage will no longer meet regularly, Dr Tom Jefferson, of the University of Oxford said: “I think this is really good news because it’s been an absolute disaster for our society. They should have gone a long time ago.“The work of this group was all about guesswork, and if you’re going to be ruled by guesswork then we’re all doomed. The modellers have a track record of getting things wrong.”Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also a member of SPi-M, said: “It is, in my opinion, entirely appropriate that Sage stands down at this moment.  “With very high levels of immunity in the population – largely as a result of the hugely successful vaccination programme – and new and improved treatments and therapeutics coming on stream, we are now in a completely different situation to the one that we were in when Sage first started to meet about Covid.  “Although there is still much to learn and continuing uncertainty about the future incidence of disease, the need to assess the evidence and summarise it for policy-makers is now less urgent.  Let’s hope that it stays that way.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir gavins gong national embarrassment","story":"It was last September when I first caught wind that Gavin Williamson was to be given a knighthood. As I reported at the time, “there are suggestions Boris Johnson may have made the offer to soften the blow of the former education secretary’s sacking in the Cabinet reshuffle”.The news filled me with such a sense of incredulity that I rang Mr Williamson on his mobile to find out if he was as astonished as I was. This was the Frank Spencer of the House of Commons we were talking about here – a man so gaffe-prone that, on one particularly excruciating occasion, he couldn’t tell the difference between footballer Marcus Rashford and rugby player Maro Itoje.Parliament’s Private Pike answered my call after a couple of rings and then spent about a minute claiming that he had no reception and was struggling to hear me – even though it was a completely clear line.I note from the original story that I managed to extract from the South Staffordshire MP – in between his Rada-seque “can you repeat that, I can hardly hear you’s” – that the gong was “not something” he had “heard about”.Curious, really, when you consider that rumours of the tarantula-owning former chief whip’s knighthood date back to the days of Theresa May.Despite having fired the former fireplace salesman as defence secretary in 2019 for allegedly leaking details from a top-level National Security Council meeting, like Mr Johnson, Mrs May apparently still feels “indebted” to this master of the dark arts for helping to run her leadership campaign. Mr Williamson also worked on Mr Johnson’s leadership campaign team.Quite why either of them thinks they owe him anything is anyone’s guess.In both instances – there wasn’t much to whip. Mrs May was up against Andrea Leadsom and Michael Gove, neither of whom ended up being much of a threat, while Tory MPs were never going to pick Jeremy Hunt over Boris Johnson in 2019, hence why they backed the PM two to one.Mr Williamson’s gong could well be the biggest reward for failure the country has witnessed since “Sir” Nick Clegg joined Facebook after losing his seat in 2015 and reducing the Liberal Democrats to ruins.This is the former defence secretary, after all, who notoriously told Russia to “go away and shut up” in 2018 (that went well). Then as education secretary, Mr Williamson was the man whose bungling incompetence cocked up the educational aspirations of an entire generation.He closed schools when he didn’t need to, U-turned on GCSE and A-Level algorithms that should never have been applied in the first place, and couldn’t even get free school meals to children in lockdown – let alone laptops.Now the Prime Minister seems to be saying that it is okay to overlook all of that – along with the fact that he has been sacked, not once, but twice, from government – because he is quite handy with a spreadsheet during a leadership race. Arise, Sir Useless!The Government’s defenders might say that this isn’t a reward for failure. In fact, it’s a reward for loyalty because Gavvers hasn’t caused any “trouble” on the backbenches since his second sacking.But notwithstanding the “trouble” that he appears to be able to cause in an empty room, what possible threat could he pose on the backbenches when so many of his Conservative colleagues appear to think that he’s an idiot?The issue here is not that the Queen or some other unfortunate royal will have to hold their nose while placing a red ribboned insignia around Mr Williamson’s neck. It is that none of us are surprised that someone this undeserving has received one of the country’s top gongs.Sadly, rewards for failure have become a defining characteristic, not just of our honours system, but of our entire society.Sure, we can have a debate over whether Labour leaders such as Tony Blair and even Keir Starmer deserve to be called “Sir”, but a bigger problem for voters is the total and utter lack of accountability at every level of public life.There can surely be no better example than the Post Office scandal which saw 736 sub-postmasters and mistresses wrongly prosecuted for theft and fraud thanks to failures with the Horizon computer system. People lost their livelihoods, their liberty, their marriages and – in some cases – their lives and yet it took years to clear their names.Despite being described as one the most egregious miscarriages of justice in British history, nobody from the Post Office or Fujitsu, which created the Horizon system, or the civil servants charged with oversight has really been held accountable, much less faced criminal investigation themselves.Instead, Paula Vennells, the chief executive who presided over this complete and utter shambles, has been able to keep her CBE (awarded for “services to the Post Office and to charity”). She did step down from her role as chair of London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust and as “a non-executive board member of the Cabinet Office”. But why did she get those jobs – particularly one in government – in the first place?There are similar examples everywhere you look. We recently learned that Anglian Water’s chief executive Peter Simpson and its chief financial officer Steve Buck were paid more than £2.2million in bonuses despite the company leaking untreated sewage into our rivers and streams 17,428 times.Meanwhile, it has been reported that Dame Cressida Dick will be trousering a £500,000 pay off as well as a £160,000 annual pension, despite presiding over a string of blunders at the politan Police, including the Operation Midland farago, the Daniel Morgan inquiry, the Sarah Everard murder and vigil, and the Exctinction Rebellion farce.This isn’t the politics of envy, by the way. If people do a good job then by all means offer them golden handshakes or parachutes. But despite her popularity with her own coppers, who could possibly claim with a straight face that Calamity Cressida was a triumph as Met commissioner?Incidentally, even the officer at the centre of the disastrous probe into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring by the fantasist Carl Beech prospered. Steve Rodhouse took his total package at the National Crime Agency to almost £300,000 in 2020, making him among the highest earners in UK law enforcement. This is despite one of the officers working for this 21st century Inspector Clouseau finding the claims made by the serial liar known as “Nick” “credible and true”, in a move that severely damaged the reputations of several innocent people.Another shocking award for failure was the damehood handed to Alison Saunders after she had stepped down as director of public prosecutions in 2018 following a series of controversies, including the collapse of a series of rape trials due to the late disclosure of evidence.Dame Alison defended her honour, saying that it was for “30 years of public service”. Perhaps she’d like to tell that to longstanding BBC radio presenter Paul Gambaccini who, a week after Saunders stepped down from the Crown Prosecution Service, was awarded a five-figure settlement after being wrongly arrested as part of Operation Yewtree. His knighthood has presumably got lost in the post.By rewarding Mr Williamson for failure, the honours system has never looked more dishonourable.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"xi jinping miscalculated thought china would gain easy little","story":"It was a peculiar move. As Russian troops moved in, despite shared intelligence and warnings by the West, China decided not to get its citizens out of Ukraine. Instead, it suggested they display a Chinese flag prominently at their window. A few days later, the advice changed. Take down your flag, Beijing advised, and get out.Diplomats scrambled to interpret this. A view emerged that it must show that China had been blindsided by the invasion. Just days before, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping had signed a pact claiming their friendship had “no limits”. Yet if Mr Putin had warned his new best friend about the war, surely Mr Xi would have evacuated his citizens?Here’s a theory that makes much more sense. Beijing knew about the invasion and, taking Mr Putin’s assessment at face value, assumed that it would be quick and easy. As soon as the Russian troops arrived, they would see the Chinese flags and know to show the proper respect.It didn’t turn out that way. But the underlying logic of this version of events is chilling. Beijing is no neutral party. It tacitly supported the invasion and, while retaining public deniability at the UN and elsewhere, has shown its hand quietly.Comments supportive of Ukraine are heavily censored on the Chinese internet, for example not so those supporting Russia or criticising Nato. Anti-Americanism is the ideological glue binding together all Mr Xi’s foreign and domestic political policy. The war in Ukraine is no exception.After all, on the face of it, the war looks like an opportunity for Beijing. Assuming that Mr Xi did know about it in advance, he probably assumed that it would continue Mr Putin’s successful campaign of undermining Western credibility and illustrate that export dependency breeds weakness in one’s enemies.Following the storming of the US Capitol and the shambolic Afghan withdrawal, the Chinese Communist Party might even have hoped it would help bring on the expected collapse of the Western democracies as major powers.This points to a sinister new era, in which the two great powers of Eurasia agree to carve up each end of the continent and offer a mutual backstop against Western sanctions. If Moscow needs new markets for its commodities, a channel to access trade and foreign lending, and a source of semiconductors, China can help.In turn, China can tap Russia for cheap raw materials, in line with the deal they made in February.Even with Russia’s war not quite going to plan, some still argue that it helps China. For Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cadres with a historical perspective, it is a satisfying reversal of the Sino-Russian relationship during the Stalinist era, when Chairman Mao played the junior partner.A weakened Russia will depend more on China, a recession triggered by rising energy prices will weaken the West, and Nato will be bogged down. The sanctions have prompted speculation that China will accelerate plans to build up its own financial system and currency.Not so fast. In truth, the war – or, more specifically, the war’s effect on the West – could instead signal the start of a significantly more difficult geopolitical environment for China.For one thing, the runaway success of China’s model over the last few decades relies upon a world that is largely open to its investment and exports and indifferent to ideological creeds. China’s integration with the global economy means, for example, that its banks will likely end up obeying most American sanctions even if they would rather not, for the sake of retaining access to the vast array of economic activity that is linked to the US or the dollar.The renminbi itself is unable to displace the dollar fully because it is subject to capital controls, which Beijing won’t be giving up any time soon. As for access to Russia’s commodities, the war hasn’t changed that much.Covid had already triggered a review of supply chains across the world. Sanctions on Russia are accelerating the trend. European governments were already worrying about medical and technology supplies. Now they are worrying about gas and rare metals, too.Private companies, meanwhile, have just been painfully burned by sanctions on Russia. Decoupling from China would be a much bigger operation, but the experience is already sparking conversations about exposure to China if war were to break out in Asia. Existing concerns about forced labour and the security of telecoms or electronics supplies are widening to other areas.But the biggest reason why Mr Putin’s gamble is not to his ally’s advantage is that Ukraine and its people have reminded the West what we stand for – and inspired us to stand up for it.The era of loose talk not backed by real intent or posturing over “strategic autonomy” while treating defence as a distasteful relic is over. Defence budgets are going to rise.The isions sown by Donald Trump, Brexit and the culture wars have been put into perspective and, for the first time since the Cold War, democratic countries have been forced to think strategically about their interests and alliances.Nato, previously over-extended and decaying, has been given a new sense of purpose and resolve. Germany, for the first time, has realised that its cravenly commercial foreign policy must end and that it must play its part in the defence of freedom. Instead of outsourcing all production abroad and luxuriating in our virtue over climate change, energy policy is back on the agenda.China, in its implicit support for the devastation unfolding in Europe, no longer looks like a neutral party or a golden goose.In Asia, meanwhile, Japan and South Korea have begun to talk for the first time about the possibility of nuclear guarantees for Taiwan. The notion that Western democracies would get “distracted” by Ukraine doesn’t seem to be playing out in practice. The United States sent a delegation to Taiwan to discuss defence a few days ago and there is more talk than ever of the island’s fate.Now, it is obviously easy to talk and hard to act and the sanctions on Russia are going to take their toll on the West too, especially if they expand to include oil and gas. But my instinct says that the West has woken up to the catastrophic consequences of empty talk without action.Daily, we are watching Ukraine bear the devastating consequences of the West’s failure to think strategically and Europe’s fantastical belief that our values alone will keep us safe.China might have thought a quick little war in Europe by its ally would be a helpful irritant to the Western world. Instead, it has roused the spirit of freedom from its slumber.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Nato of giving \u0026#39green light to bombing\u0026#39Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The What Volodymyr Zelensky is really like, by the people who know him bestInvasion an \u0026#39abomination\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells Ukraine in video messageBoris Johnson: The West must stop a nuclear disaster in UkraineRussia blocks use of Facebook and Twitter in crackdown on informationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham seat stuck labour erdington","story":"Why Birmingham seat stuck with Labour - Erdington needs bringing back to leNeelam Aslam, a trainee solicitor who is , said Paulette Hamilton - who she described as a really nice lady - has lived in the area for a long time.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary. A blood hound Hero dog Arnie is retiring after donating  pints of blood in his letime that have helped more than  other pets. Thankfully this real blood hound was not terrier-fied of needles.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

So when she arrived at Thursdayaposs by-election count at the local sports centre and staff were all smiley, she was dumfounded. Then somebody said to me aposI think weaposve got thisapos, she says. But even then, Birminghamaposs first ever Black MP was not convinced. It just felt like aposyou know what you knowapos but no one had actually said it.So when we went to hear the actual results, it blew my mind. I thought I had probably won by  or  votes or some madness because I just wasnapost surethat Labour vote would come out.In fact, the mum-of-five had secured a , majority and increased Labouraposs vote share in the Red Wall constituency to .%. The -year-old, who will be officially sworn in as a Member of Parliament on Monday, is no stranger to being tested at the ballot box.  She has served as a ward councillor on Birmingham City Council for  years, most recently as Cabinet member for health during the pandemic. The former nurse could be forgiven for finding the campaign trail a surreal experience, however, having lost her father to a heart attack barely two days after she was selected. He was a former factory worker and a Labour man, she said. So when I went into local politics, he was really proud. He would come back from the high street and say aposI saw one of your your constituents and they told me what you didapos. You could see it made him walk that little bit taller and that was brilliant. But the only sad thing now is that he wonapost to see me go to Parliament. Growing up in a working class household of Jamaican heritage in s Birmingham was not without its challenges, the grandmother-of-six acknowledges. One schoolteacher her she would not amount to anything, and that girls like me were destined only aposto have babiesapos, she has said. But another teacher, in the cityaposs Handsworth girlsapos school, made her believe she could go far, and she went on to achieve A Levels, a degree and take up a career in nursing. She has also previously revealed to the Mirror: Iaposve faced racism and faced issues where people have thought perhaps I wasnapost good enough to do it because of the areas Iaposve grown up in. I remember once a senior telling meyou are going to achieve anything in nursing, you donapost just have to be as good as your white counterpart, you have to be twice as good. It was during her time as a nurse that she married husband Dennis, who now runs The Hat Man store near the city centreaposs Bullring.  Tackling Birminghamaposs health inequalities, which have been laid bare by the Covid pandemic, will be among Ms Hamiltonaposs top priorities. It was something that kept her regularly in touch with former Birmingham Erdington MP Jack Dromey, whose sudden death in January triggered the by-election race. She said Mr Dromey, , was not one of her mentors, but she deeply respected the former trade unionist as a good constituency MP, the residents loved him. I keep thinking what would he sayhe was here  I think he would be saying: thataposs what I like, she said. He was just genuinely one of those that wanted to see people get on and even though heaposs no longer here, the fact that thereaposs a woman and a woman of colour in his seat... I think he would be really happy about that. Ms Hamilton said, despite  years in politics, her passion to battle for her community is undimmed. She said: I always felt there was something I could give back. Iaposve always spoken for other people, because I donapost like injustice.And thataposs what I love about the Labour Party. It looks at the injustices that communities are facing and it tries to recty them. Because at times people are struggling, and they need to know that people hear what theyaposre saying. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer congratulated Ms Hamilton on her election this week, saying: Congratulations to Paulette Hamilton, Labouraposs new MP for Birmingham Erdington and the cityaposs first Black MP.Youaposve made history. As a dedicated community champion I know that you will bring security, prosperity and respect to the people of Erdington.

Abby Vollet, , gave birth to her -month-old daughter Khalani in March  via emergency C-section at  weeks. But Abby claims she was totally unaware she was pregnant until she got to hospital on the night her daughter ended up being delivered. The full-time student from Missouri in the US was terried when doctors told her she was fully dilated and needed to have a caesarean. I had no idea that I was pregnant. I didnapost experience any symptoms and I didnapost gain any weight. No one saw this coming. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The pain started off with slight stomach cramps. They continued to get worse over the day to the point where I couldnapost move, so my mum, Cindy, , took me to the hospital. I had an ultrasound and the doctors told me I was pregnant and I was fully dilated. I remember telling the doctor that it wasnapost true. I was in total shock. At first they estimated I was around  weeks, but after the C-section, they said I was actually between  to  weeks.  Abby said at first, she was embarrassed to be young, single mum and even refused to see baby Khalani for the first few days of her le. She added her friends didnapost believe the story at first - because it was so close to April Foolsapos Day. Abby says: The doctors think that she must have been behind my ribs because I had no bumps and I never felt any kicks. I was even getting my period the whole time and I comfortably fit into all of my size medium clothes the whole way through. Abby said she never had much of a relationship with Khalaniaposs dad, so itaposs just been the two of them against the world.She said: Before having my daughter, I honestly never wanted to have children and didnapost plan for it to happen in my le. But now she is here, I absolutely love her. It was really weird at first. I almost saw her as someone aposs child. We didnapost have that immediate bond because I didnapost know that she was coming and it was such a shock. Abby said, on top of the shock of having a surprise baby, she also had to deal with complications following the birth when her stitches became infected. But after several weeks of treatment, she was on her way to recovery. And luckily, Khalani has always been in perfect health.Abby said: Khalani has always been healthy which is surprising because I had just turned  when I was pregnant. I had obviously drunk throughout the pregnancy because I was totally unaware.She is the easiest baby ever. Sheaposs so outgoing and funny. My miracle child.

In the footage before his death, Kyrell of Thornton Heath, London, can be seen singing happy birthday together with his mum.The toddler celebrated his second birthday five weeks before he was murdered, and is giggling on his mum’s hip as she sings to him. Another video shows the youngster in his pyjamas on the sofa, as his mum films him laughing and smiling. The playful scene is a stark contrast to the horric scene that was met by paramedics who desperately tried to save his le after he went into cardiac arrest on October , . Shirley made a  call after her son fell unconscious and his body became “floppy”. In what prosecutor Edmund Brown QC described as a “relatively calm” tone, she told the NHS call handler: “Basically Kyrell has been acting really funny.His chest is like coming out like he can’t breathe, he’s not responding properly. “He’ll be laying down and he’ll lash out, he looks like he’s not here basically. His eyes are rolling back.” Shirley later became increasingly distressed as she was advised to give CPR and was told an ambulance unit was on its way. Paramedics arrived at the scene  minutes after the initial call, but despite their best efforts to save the toddler, they were unable to maintain a heartbeat.Kyrell was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.A post-mortem examination found a “catalogue of very signicant additional injuries” he had suffered, including  rib fractures, internal bleeding and a lacerated liver. Whilst five of the broken ribs were attributed to resuscitation efforts, it was determined that his injuries would have been sustained on at least five occasions in the four weeks leading up to his death.Mr Brown, , told jurors: “What you will hear of amounts to no less than a determined pattern of repeated and signicant assaults – on a completely defenceless and young child. “And it will be no surprise that the effect of these injuries would have been real pain, not only on their infliction, of course, but also pain and discomfort after and following each violent episode.” Brown and Shirley couple were arrested on October  and charged with his murder, with both denying the charges. Brown, who is not Kyrell’s father, said that he had gone to the shops that morning, and had ed to find the two-year-old unconscious.  He said that they had tried to feed him “cornflakes, juice and sweets to help him wake up”, and that his mum had then decided to call the emergency services. However, investigating officers were to make a shocking discovery as it emerged that hours of the abuse had been captured on Shirley’s mobile phone.In an attempt to seeher boyfriend was cheating on her, she had secretly recorded him whilst she was out of the flat.The harrowing audio footage was played to jurors, who could hear Brown repeatedly telling the toddler to “shut up”, followed by slapping and hitting noises. In a recording taken from July , Brown can be heard telling Kyrell “No more crying, stop, stop crying”, and “What are you crying for ”.After this, a slapping noise can be heard above Kyrell’s distressed wailing, followed by Brown mocking the child’s crying.In one audio recording, it is believed that Kyrell was hit around seven or eight times in the space of  seconds.  His mum can also be heard in the background of a few recordings, as she too tells Kyrell to “shut up” when he is in distress.During the initial playing of the videos, Shirley was escorted from the court by a police officer. In addition to this, Kyrell’s grandparents revealed that after he visited their home in September , he was reluctant toto his mum’s flat.He had been “much quieter than usual” and was unable to settle.At the time of Kyrell’s death, his mum had been in a relationship with Brown for approximately a year, and despite having separate addresses, he was regularly at the flat. Neither were employed and Kyrell, who was non-verbal, was not registered at a nursery, therefore he was constantly in contact with the couple.Both denied his murder, butShirley pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing physical harm to be caused to a child.Her defence lawyer, Louise Sweet QC, had made it clear throughout the trial that she rejected the term “causing”. Jurors at the Old Bailey had seen evidence from forensic pathologist Dr Evan Matshes who said that Shirley should not have been told by NHS  staff to administer two-handed CPR to her son.Dr Matshes said he could not rule out that those actions had caused the broken ribs.Brown’s lawyer Mark McDonald asked the jury to “keep an open mind” and it was his case that the CPR administered to Kyrell that resulted in his death, and not the alleged abuse he suffered at home. Brown was found guilty of all three charges, including murder, whereas Shirley was found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at the Old Bailey.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder trialOld Bailey\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I didn’t let my dad see until I had about four or five face tattoos, he told the Daily Star.Despite being stared at in the street, Sammy said he has blossomed and become so much more confident in all aspects since having face tattoos.Sharing throwback photographs of himself, he told how the old Sammy would be proud and inspired of his new look. He added: “When I see photos of myself without face tattoos I see a boy who wasn’t quite himself, someone who was shy, nervous and hiding. Friends told Sammy, who now lives in Cambridgeshire, he did not look even slightly right when he posted photographs of his bare face. Some even went so far as to say that they could not bear to look at the photo as it removed a part of the person.  Sammy got his first face tattoo at the age of  and said his biggest concern was showing his mum and dad. He showed his parents by taking a selfie beneath the Christmas lights at Oxford Circus without acknowledging the tattoos. Despite the initial shock, he said his parents have become more accepting and see through the general stereotype. They have since gone on to have body tattoos themselves and do not see it as a bad thing, he explained. Sammy tends to choose well-meaning tattoos with the word aposgentleapos on one side of his face and the word aposloverapos under his eye.  Most face tattoos he sees online are aggressive including dagger drawings and aposdeathapos mottos. He chose his aposgentleapos tattoo to express who he is, but is often judged by strangers despite his more welcoming designs. People stare when he walks into shops but he said it no longer bothers him as it must be interesting and unusual for many. But he is left frustrated by shop security guards and online trolls that judge him without knowing him. “That’s the most annoying thing but you just can’t let it bug you,” Sammy said. The tattoo fanatic said he wished people would try to see the person he is rather than drawing negative assumptions based on stereotypes. Sammy added: “A tattoo doesn’t change a person, you can get a tattoo and stay the same. You don’t instantly become a bad person just because you have a tattoo.

The code states people shouldnapost undertake other motorists for being slow on the motorway. While many drivers do so, you could receive a hefty fineyouaposre spotted. While there is no law about it, undertaking recklessly could see you hit with three penalty points and a £ fine either for careless driving, or driving without due care and attention.Some police forces may offer a driver education course as an alternative,Birmingham Livereports.Rule  of The Highway Code states: In congested conditions, where adjacent lanes of traffic are moving at similar speeds, traffic in left-hand lanes may sometimes be moving faster than traffic to the right.  In these conditions you may keep up with the traffic in your lane eventhis means passing traffic in the lane to you right. Do not weave in and out of lanes to overtake. While there is no specic law prohibiting undertaking, it could easily be a dangerous manoeuvre - which would be illegal. If the vehicle is travelling in the middle lane when the lane to its left is clear, the driver could be given a fixed penalty by police and depending on the circumstances, any driver undertaking that vehicle on the left could also face a penalty. Undertaking is when you overtake on the inside lane. When you overtake a slower vehicle on the road using a lane that is kerb side to the vehicle you are passing. In the UK this would be a lane to the right of the vehicle being passed. This happens usually on roads where there is more than one lane in the same direction, such as motorways. Where traffic is congested and everyone is moving at similar speeds you may be able to undertake to keep up with traffic in your lane even though it means you pass vehicles in the lane to your right. However, you shouldnapost weave in and out of the lanes to get ahead. The Code strongly advises that you avoid overtaking generally and you can get into troubleyou decide to move across three lanes.

Owner Michaela Sedmakova was watching her four-year-old dog play off lead in a park in Danescourt, Cardf, when he yelled like never before.Knowing something was wrong, Michaela rushed to her dog, Mason, to check what had happening.She thought he might have broken his leg when playfully running after another dog - and did not expect his injury to be le-changing. Michaela said: He ran to meet some friends when all of a sudden, his back legs stopped moving. He thudded to the ground and cried out.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Shouting to her husband, Scott, to calm their dog while she started up the car, Michaela rushed Mason to the vets to get a professionalaposs opinion on the situation.Once in the car, we phoned our vets to say we were on our way. We don’t know what happened, but it wasnapost looking good, she said. At that point, Mason was trying to find comfortable position on the seat next to me but he was just bent really awkward and unnatural. When we arrived at the vets, they took him in straight away and told us to wait in the car. They were updating us regularly. They did a blood test and checked his limbs but couldn’t see anything wrong with them and after couple of hours waiting, they told us it could be a spinal injury. Mason was referred to an overnight animal hospital in Bristol, where they specialise in neurology, a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system.  Michaela added: They took Mason in on a stretcher. After some time, the vet called us in to speak to us. She said until the MRI is done, they won’t know what it is. We were sent home again and were supposed to wait for a call. These were the worst longest and darkest four days. We couldn’t sleep, we couldn’t eat, we just cried. Finally the long awaited phone call arrived but Michaela and Scott didnapost receive the positive news they had been so desperately hoping for. The MRI showed what she was expecting - a non-compressive disc extrusion, which means he is paralysed in his back legs, said Michaela. They kept him for couple more days to seehe would start eating. When we picked him up after  days, we couldn’t wait to see him. He was so happy to see us.Michaela and Scott took little Mason home because they couldnapost bear to be without him any longer. She said: We had to learn how to use his special harness, to express his bladder three times a day, to exercise him four to six times a day and we were referred to a physiotherapist in Cowbridge. We won’t give up the hope even though we’ve been told he may never walk again. Throughout everything, Mason has remained his smiling self - but heartrendingly doesnapost understand why he can no longer run around and jump on the sofa with his owners. Michaela has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover Masonaposs medical treatments which are not covered by their insurance. Speaking on Masonaposs behalf, his GoFundMe page reads: Mummy and daddy took me home, where I feel happy again. They hope thatI do all my exercises, I might be able to play with my friends soon. They need some support to pay for the physiotherapy, hydrotherapy or a possible future surgery. I was insured but the blood test, MRI, hospital stay and special equipment already come close to £,, which exceeds my level of cover. I’m trying to help my parents to get some funds for my future recovery. I have a long road ahead to get myself back on my feet. Any contributions will go a long way.To help support Mason, visit his GoFundMe page. Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

And it seems that in the past few months, she has recycled and re-worn many more of her older items - including a pair of boots that sheaposs had in her wardrobe for well over  years. Here we look back at some of her most recycled pieces, especially ones that have caught the eye recently... Trusted bootsKateaposs most recent royal engagement was a day trip to Wales alongside her husband Prince William.For most of the visit, she wore a pair of black Aquatalia Rouge boots teamed with skinny black jeans and a beautul Sportmax coat. At it appears the £ boots have been a long-fixture in Kateaposs wardrobe - and they got their first royal outing  years ago. Kate sported the boots for her first official royal engagment in  when she christened a new leboat in Anglesey.

Click here to sign up .Not only does Kate seem to recycle her designer pieces - she also appears to do the same with her High Street clothes.Last October she wore a bargain £ grey houndstooth dress from Zara while on a visit to the University College LondonapossCentre for Longitudinal Studies.Sheaposd previously worn the garment, which comes complete with a pussy bow neck, on a trip to Bradford in , and teamed it with a pair of grey Hugo Boss heels. Military-style blouseAnother long-fixture in Kateaposs wardrobe is a stunning military-inspired blouse by one of her favourite designers Alexander McQueen. She recently wore the top, which comes with gold detailing, in November while visiting Londonaposs Imperial War Museum. But it got its first outing back in  during a trip to Birmingham - although Kate teamed it with a skirt rather than trousers on this occasion. Catherine Walker dress Last month, Kate joined her father-in-law Prince Charles and his we Camilla for a rare day out in East London. On that day, Kate opted to wear a chic grey coat dress with a black collar and grey belt by Catherine Walker.And it was the same dress she previously sported in  during an engagement with the Queen at Kingaposs College, London. But sheaposs not just recycled it once - she also wore the same dress in  at a service to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Jenny Packham gownIt may be tempting for Kate to go shopping every time she gets invited to a black tie event.But she clearly resisted temptation when she attended the Royal Variety Performance in November. For it, she wore a glittering forest green Jenny Packham sequinned gown that she had worn before. The first time she sported it was in  during an official tour to Pakistan.

Brittany Blackwell, , was driving to her friends for a cuppa when the flames ignited, causing her family home in Kings Lynn, Norfolk to explode on Wednesday February .Now even more shockingly, firefighters have suggested that the mystery blaze could have started from a ray of sunlight refracting onto a curtain and setting it alight. The young mum had planned to be at home with her two children, Theo, three, and Tiana eight months, but changed her plans last minute.She told The Mirror : “I wouldn’t have thought that a cup of tea would have saved my le. “It’s one of those silly little things that you end up doing that slightly changes your plans. “If I hadn’t gone round, I would have been home just before the house exploded. “It feels like a miracle, I feel like my friend saved us by inviting us round.” As the heat and smoke built up inside, the pressure created an explosion which blew the roof off in front of horried neighbours. But fire crews have been unable to determine the exact cause of the fire, and say it could have simply been a ray of sunlight refracting onto a mirror, Brittany claims. She said: “They said it would have happened in a matter of minutes.“They have ruled out a gas leak and said it could be as simple as sunlight refracting from a mirror onto the curtains. “That has made it a lot harder to come to terms with. “Thinking that something as simple as the sun could rip apart your family home is beyond belief.” The house, which belongs to Brittany’s grandparents, has been in the family for  years.Brittany had been renting the place from her gran since May , with the intention of taking over the mortgage in the coming years. But the young stay at home mum hadn’t bought contents insurance, explaining that with rising energy bills and the cost of living, it was another cost that she couldn’t afford. She and her partner have been able to salvage their children’s memory boxes, although the treasured items, including umbilical cords and babygrows, were heavily damaged by smoke and water. Everything  was completely destroyed, leaving the young family with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Now they have launched a GoFundMe in a bid to replace their white goods, clothes, children’s toys and other essential items.They estimate they will need £, to rebuild their lives. Brittany said: “It was going to be my forever home. “We would never risk losing it because it’s a family house, it’s full of memories even from when I was growing up. “To see it taken away in a matter of minutes has absolutely destroyed me.”To donate click hereRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsTeaHouse fires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As her daughter’s second birthday approaches, Lucy Cuskin is sharing her story, in an effort to help other parents who have lost a child and keep her daughter’s memory alive. When Lucy was pregnant, she had a subchorionic haematoma at  weeks - bleeding when the placenta detaches from the original site of implantation.The -year-old, of Birtley, Tyne  Wear, told Chronicle Live : I had a big bleed at  weeks. But they did a scan and everything was fine. I was told the bleeding could get less and less and then would stop. Lots of women have this and go on to have a healthy full-term pregnancy with no complications at all.I had it in my last pregnancy. I have a one-year-old daughter - she was born at  weeks and was healthy.  Despite the bleeding, Lucy had regular scans which showed her baby was fine. However, her waters broke early at  weeks.At the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, she was monitored and checked.They checked her heartbeat and everything was fine, said Lucy. Her heartbeat at lunchtime was fine. They checked it again at pm, it was fine. Then at pm at night, before going to bed, the midwe checked again but she said she couldnapost get a heartbeat. I was not worried at all because it was always a bit dficult to find a heartbeat. The midwe said she would get a more experienced midwe, who came but she could not find a heartbeat either. She called a doctor and they did a scan. The doctor put the scanner down and said aposIaposm really sorry I canapost find a heartbeatapos.  I just said aposyou are wrong, you are going to have to check againapos. Just a few hours before, everything was fine. They checked again and said they couldnapost find a heartbeat. I was still expecting the consultant to say she had it wrong. I canapost remember much about what happened after that. They had to clear the girls from the ward because I was so distressed. I was convinced they had got it wrong. I just could not get my head around it. I thought Esmé would % be born alive and they would realise they just made a massive mistake. Preparations were then made for the birth. Lucy started dilating and Esmé was born sleeping at .am on March , . Lucy needed surgery to remove the placenta. She was able to spend two precious days with little Esmé. She and her partner Gary Ord, , spent time with her, made hand and foot prints of their baby and were able to keep her in a cuddle cot.  The staff at the RVI were absolutely beyond amazing, said Lucy. They told us how beautul Esmé was and helped us pick out outfits for her. We got to cuddle her and make memories. When she was in the cuddle cot, I looked at her and still expected her to move. That time we had with her was so important. We got to look at her, her face, all her features and see how beautul she was. Itaposs really important that parents get that time. Lucy, who has a four-year-old son, Jonah, and one year-old daughter, Thea, is now helping to raise funds for the charity Louis, which supports families affected by miscarriage, stillbirth and the loss of a child.She works as a stylist at the Halo salon on Station Road, in Hebburn, where her colleagues have been helping to raise cash.They held a walk to the Angel of the North and have organised raffles. They will be hosting a bake sale on March  and  in memory of Esmé. More than £, has already been raised. Lesley Little, , owner of Halo, said: We are doing this because Lucy means a lot to us and the charity Louis helps people who have lost a child. Things like cuddle cots and memory boxes make a massive dference to peopleaposs lives and we want to do everything we can to support the charity.Anyone wishing to make a donation can do so here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesPregnancyMiscarriage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nafahat,  months, died of a chest infection after weeks of neglect at the hands of -year-old Fartun Jamal at her flat in Kingfisher Way, Brent Park, London. The mother made a series of web searches, including I canapost cope with my child anymore and I want to give up my child, while living with the baby in early . She knew Nafahat was unwell with a very high temperature and poor appetite but failed to take her to a doctor, jurors were told during a trial at Harrow Crown Court. Visitors in the weeks leading up to the babyaposs death recalled her cot was broken and the flat was overrun with takeaway boxes, dirty plates and nappies.  On February , social services attended the property after concerns were raised by a babysitter. However, they warned Jamal ahead of their visit and, when they arrived, they found the flat was clean and the situation had improved. A second social services visit, without warning, was planned for March  - the day Nafahat died. When paramedics were called to the property by a neighbour at .pm, Jamal told them she had found her daughteraposs body after having a dream the baby had stopped breathing. During the three-week trial, jurors were told the baby had been ill from at least March  and could have been saved had her mother sought adequate medical care. Jamal claimed a GP had told her Nafahat look fine andit gets worse, give her some Calpol when she raised concerns about her daughteraposs health in the weeks before her death. But prosecutor Edward Brown QC told jurors the mother had never spoken with a doctor. Instead, Jamal had called the nearest surgery twice but never got through to a GP, with receptionists adamant they would not have offered her medical advice, the court was told. Jamal had an abusive upbringing and moved to the UK from Somalia at a young age without her mother, jurors heard. Giving evidence, she said when Nafahat was born she instantly fell in love with her the moment I got hold of her. But she told jurors she became depressed and anxious due to being a parent with little support. I felt useless because of the le I had growing up. I didnapost want the same , she said. Nicolly Ruffo, a babysitter who attended the home on March , said the property smelt of old milk, with the cupboards empty of food apart from crisps. Another babysitter, Aimee Whittaker-George, contacted social services about the living conditions after visiting the home on February . A witness statement from Dr Michael Coren, a consultant paediatrician, said: There was clear evidence of neglect in the family home of Ms Jamal. He said there were environmental signs of neglect and the flat was chaotic and dirty. Jamal was charged with one count of causing Nafahataposs death by neglect, two counts of child cruelty in relation to Nafahat, and a third count of child cruelty in relation to another child. A jury found her guilty on Friday of all four counts after deliberating for nearly nine hours. Judge Rosa Dean told Jamal, who wept as the verdicts were read, it was highly likely she would receive a custodial sentence. The -year-old was released on bail ahead of sentence at the same court on  April.

But, what does the letter stand for  Many Reddit users have theorised as to why theyaposve found a letter aposPapos scribbled onto their letters. One person fretted: “Itaposs what thieves use to mark your house to let others know you have expensive dogs.”  Another user giggled: “Very subtle Wordle clue - takes  days then you just rearrange them. Never right.” But there is nothing to fear as it has nothing to do with criminal markings or even a show of dislike towards you from your local postman. In fact, the ‘P’ is an important signier allowing your postman to do their job correctly and efficiently, making sure you get all your deliveries on time.  Luckily, a postman on Reddit reassured the masses that the ‘P’ just helps them and their fellow postmans track when there are parcels coming. They explained: “You had a packet parcel. Stops us from forgetting about it!” And another reiterated the point: “Itaposs the postieaposs way of reminding themselves that when they come to post your letter thereaposs also a parcel for you. Thataposs so they donapost post your letter then find out halfway down the street they forgot to knock and give you your parcel. “Or sometimes theyaposll write P or something on the previous letter - that lets them know they have a parcel for next doorbut no letter.” So that is the answer for the mystery ‘P’ - just a reminder for postmen that they have a parcel to deliver as well as a letter.

A diner who visited the Fox Inn in Lower Chaddesley, Worcestershire, left an anonymous one-star review, calling it the worst carvery he had ever visited - with the beef being tough and very fatty.The diner’s review of the pub, which, with a four-star rating on Tripadvisor is one of the most highly rated restaurants in the town, prompted the owner of The Fox Inn to respond and call the review “suspicious”.

I am surprised the man had the front to serve it to me I would not of given it to my dog! So I ended up having a lovely meal of cold vegetables and under cooked roast potatoes.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly.

With such boycotts and bans of Russian brands taking place, many people will be left confused over which brands they should buy and which ones they should dodge amid Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine.When we think of vodka, Smirnoff, which is one of the world’s best-selling vodka brands, will always come to mind. But is Smirnoff a Russian-made vodka brand  While many assume the popular beverage brand is Russian and with some even threatening to boycott it, itaposs important to note Smirnoff no longer has Russian owners. Hereaposs what you need to know.Where is vodka brand Smirnoff from and what are its origins   The Smirnoff vodka brand has its origins in Russia, with roots in Moscow, where Pyotr Arsenievich Smirnov founded a vodka distillery in . However, the beverage is not a Russian product anymore and now has UK owners. Smirnov’s distillery was also reportedly a favourite of the Russian royal family. However, after the vodka industry was nationalised in , Vladimir Smirnov, who was Pyotr’s third son, had to sell the distillery and the brand. In , Vladimir Smirnov sold the rights for their familyaposs vodka production to Russian-born businessman Rudolph Kunett, who came to New York in the s. Since then, the Smirnoff brand has changed hands several times over the years, and it is now owned by UK firm, Diageo. The manufacturer, which also owns the alcohol brand Guinness, has also announced that it has paused exports of its liquor to Russia. A Smirnoff spokesperson told Reuters: Our priority is the safety of our people in Ukraine and the wider region. Who makes Smirnoff vodka now  Though its roots are in Russia, Smirnoff vodka isn’t actually made in Russia today. While manufacturer Diageoaposs products, including Smirnoff vodka and other spirits, are manufactured in dferent parts of the world, the drink is not produced in Russia. The countries Smirnoff gets produced in includes the UK, United States, Ireland, Italy, Brazil and Latvia. Which vodka brands are Russian   Just like Smirnoff, many popular brands of vodka in the UK are actually not made in Russia anymore. For instance, Stoli is produced in Latvia after the owner of the company had a falling out with the Kremlin. One of the only brands that are still owned by Russia is Russian Standard. It is owned by Roustam Tariko, a Russian oligarch. This brand has been banned by Co-op and Morrisons, according to their spokesperson. A Co-op spokesperson told Reuters: In response to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces and as a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine weaposve taken the decision to remove from sale Russian-made Vodka.

Bitterly cold conditions are expected for Saturday morning as a weather front comes in from the east and the wintry conditions are expected to continue well into the middle of March.People are being warned to wrap up warm over the coming days while the weather becomes more unsettled by the middle of next week and less predictable. Maps from WXCharts show the icy conditions continuing for the next couple of weeks and the Met Office is warning of snow and gales. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said that a high pressure is trying to push in from the Atlantic which would mean clear skies and sunshine but another weather front is sticking on the east of the country that is bringing cloud and rain.  The temperatures will be cold especially overnight. “It will turn frosty, patchy frost for north west England, Wales and maybe even south west England as well, said Mr Deakin. Under the cloud and rain with that weather front the temperatures will hold up a few degrees above freezing but where certainly getting close to freezing even in towns and cities, and in rural parts we will be well below, maybe -C in one or two locations across Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is likely to be a east-west ide with cloud and rain to the east of the country where a weather front persists. Mr Deakin continued: A cold start hereto the weekend, a frosty old start but we should see plenty of sunshine, maybe a little bit of morning fog in a few spots. Sunny spells too for Wales and western England.  It’s further east where we are going to have this cloud and rain. Now some uncertainty about how far it is going to creep, whether the rain is going to come and go all day or whether it will be stuck under persistent rain but there is the threat of that certainly for east Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, East Anglia and the South East. It looks pretty damp here. He added: Under the cloud in the east  or C maybe squeezing up to C in Norwich and London, that is going to feel grim for the time of year. It is a similar picture for Sunday although there is likely to be more sun in the east with the high pressure finally taking over.  For next week the icy conditions remain with the threat of wind and snow as the weather becomes less settled. The Met Office states: Sunny spells with some cloud for most at first during this period, with generally stronger winds than previous days and the ongoing risk of gales in the far west and northwest. Temperatures looking to be rather below normal and perhaps feeling cooler in the wind. Through the period, frontal systems push eastwards which are likely to bring strengthening winds in addition to potential snowfall. The main impacts are likely to be from heavy rain and gales during this time. Nearer to the end of this period, there is looking to be a transition from these rather cold conditions to near normal and milder conditions. This is likely to include clearer weather with showers across all areas. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Cloud and occasional rain in the southeast moving into central areas of England. Drier and brighter for parts of East Anglia later. Mainly dry with sunny spells where. Tonight: Dry with clear periods and widespread frost in north, with some freezing fog patches. Cloud and outbreaks rain extending westwards across central and southern Britain. Sunday: Dry and sunny in north. Rather cloudy across central and southern areas with outbreaks of rain across West Midlands and southern Wales. Isolated showers possible in southeast during the afternoon. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Rather cold with overnight frost but largely dry with sunny spells for most on Monday and Tuesday. Turning windier and potentially milder into Wednesday, rain possible in the west.

The antique dealer, who has been in the business from the tender age of nine, had never seen the property but has developed a knack for treasure hunting.After taking the gamble, he realised he had stumbled upon a treasure trove full of rare and highly collectable pieces worth thousands of pounds. Speaking on his YouTube channel Curiosity Incorporated, he said: The person who lived here was really into fashion so there is a really good chance that some of these items may be designer.  So this is going to be an exploration, going through all of this stuff. Thataposs what weaposre all about here.

Instead he believes ‘there’s probably nothing ’ and that we are the only civilisation in this galaxy, at least. The -year-old boffin explained that, because it took so long for humans to evolve from a single cell in such extraordinary circumstances, he doesn’t think it has been repeated. Speaking to Noble Rot magazine, he said: “You can confine the argument to the galaxy, to the Milky Way, because we’re never going to contact anything outside that and nothing’s ever contacting us from dferent galaxies. “But in a galaxy, there are  billion stars and more planets than that...

It’s a third of the age of the universe.  “The universe has only been around for . billion years and, as sun-like stars typically last for four or five billion years, there’s a window of stability. “So it takes four or five billion years to go from a single cell to civilisation, and stars really don’t remain stable on timescales much longer than that. “The biologists I know think that it was such a freak occurrence that anything got multicellular. There’s probably nothing . “I’ve got one friend who likes to say that all there will be out there is slime at best.” Cox said the possibility that we’re alone in this galaxy should not depress us. He said: “What does it mean to live a finite, fragile le in an infinite eternal universe  Well, meaning is a property of le and intelligence. “So I’d say thatwe are the only civilisation in the Milky Way now, then Earth is the only island of meaning in a sea of  billion stars. “So that is either frightening or, well, at the same time gives you a sense of our value. “I would say the universe is meaningless without le.” Asked in the pastbelieves alien le could exist Professor Cox has not denied it but rather thinks that the chances of a hi-tech civilisation emerging in our galaxy are very slim.

Faith OaposShields Allen, from the US state of Arkansas, has risen to TikTok fame after sharing an insight into her le with her adorable pet, a -month-old cow named Ferdinand.Alongside her father, the -year-old office worker runs a hobby farm and five-acre ranch, with the pair raising and breeding miniature cows to be kept as pets. Faith lets Ferdinand live inside her house, just as though he were a dog or cat, and sheaposs even taken the time to potty-train him. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Faith said: “Anyone who owns a pet of any kind knows that there’s a special bond formed between you and your pet. This feeling is amplied greatly when you’re raising an animal on a bottle. Ferdinand truly sees me as his mother and always will be my son. He follows me everywhere and always wants to be right with me – usually licking my face. When he sees me, he ‘moos’ to get my attention and keeps doing this until I come to see him. Ferdinand was born to one of Faith’s other cows, Dutch, and - although he may not be aware of it - his sweet and loveable nature has earned him , besotted TikTok followers. In a recent video, which has clocked up . million times and . million likes, Faith reveals a little more about the beautul cowaposs background and cushy lestyle, all while young Ferdinand posed for the camera in a fetching blue and white jumper. In written text overlaying the video, Faith said: “When you were born on a farm and your mom didn’t want you so a girl in her s took you home, and now you’re a house cow who wears sweaters, takes baths, and sleeps with a heated blanket. In the clip, Ferdinand looks to be around the same size as an average dog, with his pointy ears being just a little bit lower than the door handle in the background. One viewer remarked: “He’s living that cowdashian dream. While another commented: “Cows are honestly the most kind-hearted, loving animals out there. Opening up about the challenges of keeping a pet cow, Faith added: “Ferdinand stayed on a pretty consistent potty schedule and always went shortly after he finished his bottle. This allowed us time to get him outside, like potty training a dog. I lost some sleep waking up during the night to give him his bottles, but I wouldn’t call that a challenge. His sweet face and seeing how happy he was, made it more than worth it. Although, we were not prepared [for this] as we assumed his mother would care for him. After a dficult delivery, this wasn’t the case as she wanted nothing to do with him and we had to bottle feed him so he would survive. He was like a perfect baby – after the first week or so, he slept through the night.Do you have an unusual pet story to share  We pay for stories.

The man explained he and his we are currently expecting twins, and his plan was to name them Lily and Mollythey were girls, after Lily Potter, the mother of the main character Harry, and Molly Weasley, the mother of Harryaposs best friend Ron.Butthe pair have twin boys, the dad had other ideas - as he wanted to name them Fred and George, after the Weasley twins and older brothers of Ron. He explained: So my we is pregnant and weaposre having twins. I suggested the names Fred and Georgethey are both boys and Lily and Molly for girls. My we is okay with Lily and Molly since we both have multiple deceased relatives in extended families with those names and it would be honouring them first and book names later.  But she called me an a**hole for wanting to name our kids after some book characters and would not discuss why. I honestly donapost understand her point of view, since itaposs not on the nose like Krum, Filch, or Dumbledore. Commenters on the post were ided over the topic, as some disagreed with the manaposs suggestion that Fred and George were not on the nose - especially as the characters are twins in the franchise, so anyone who has read the books or seen the films would likely be able to make the connection. One person said: You are being disingenuous about how the names arenapost on the nose. Every time your sons would be introduced together, they would have to deal with the painfully obvious realisation that you named them after Harry Potter. They will be people that have embarrassing names when theyaposre together.  As another wrote: Do you really think that wouldnapost be obvious to literally everyone  Do you want them to spend their whole lives having people wince when they hear their names and express sympathy for how cringey their childhoods must have been  Itaposs absolutely on the nose. And a third posted: You do not want to burden your kids with names that are very recognisable from books or films. Also, Fred dies in the book, how do you think that will affect the kid you name Fred  Donapost live out your fantasies through your children. But other commenters didnapost see the problem with the names and said it was perfectly okay for the man to suggest the monikers as long as he respected his weaposs opinion too. Someone said: You are allowed to want to name your kids whatever but your both have to agree. But in the same breath, she said she didn’t like Fred and George so that’s not on the table anymore. If you expect her to respect you not liking a name you have to show her the same. While someone  added: Honestly I wonapost shame anyone for considering naming their child after something they love. But be reasonable and mostly reflect on how said name will affect your children. Kids can be mean like no other. The man later ed to the post to clary that he wasnapost forcing the names on his we, and theyaposre already in discussion about dferent monikers instead. He wrote: I already dropped Fred and George when she objected. It was just that when I first suggested she immediately called me an a**hole, thus the post.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditHarry PotterTwinsParentingUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In the clip, which was posted to her @valeriadrovna account, she said: I have to rant about the worst date Iaposve ever been on and ask why men are such filthy little liars.So I met this guy on Tinder, we can call him Dan. All of his pictures were mirror selfies with weird edits and really that should have been my first red flag but hey, redaposs always been my favourite colour, so I kept talking to him. He eventually brings up how heaposs apos which is completely irrelevant to me because Iaposm vertically challenged and I do not care, but aside from that comment, the conversation was okay, so when he asks to take me out and show me a good time, I say yes. He tells me that heaposs just moved to a city near mine and I agreed to meet halfway, but he rejects every restaurant I bring up over two days. Eventually, he says we have to try this one gelato place. So I say okay, sure. And I drove  minutes to go meet him.  When Valeria arrived at the location for their date, she was confused when she seemed unable to find Dan - until she realised she was looking for a completely dferent person. And things only went from bad to worse when they went to get their gelato and Valeriaaposs date acted completely inappropriately when he discovered how unhealthy the sweet treat was. She added: When I get there, I get out of my car to look for him because he says heaposs already there, but I canapost find anybody in the line or in the car park that looks anything like his pictures. So I texted him and Iaposm like, where are you  And I get a tap on my shoulder, turn around and am at eye level with a man who is a completely dferent race than the one Iaposve been speaking to for the last couple of weeks. Instead of leaving, I go, Oh, I didnapost recognise you. To which he goes, aposYeah, women donapost like brown guys. So I edit my pictures online.apos To which I should have said no, sir, women donapost like you because youaposre a liar. But I digress and I lined up for gelato with him anyway.  He tells me to order first and doesnapost offer to pay so I get a small lemon gelato. I look over at him and he goes, aposDonapost worry, Iaposm going to pay for my own.apos And we go sit down. He takes one bite of his gelato and goes aposoh, this is unhealthy for you.apos And I go aposYeah, itaposs chocolate.apos He then stands up, throws his entire gelato into the trash can, and I sit and I wonder what Iaposm doing with my le. Just when Valeria thought things couldnapost get any weirder, she agreed to go for a walk with Dan who spent time ranting about his family and even found time to call his date poor for being interested in kayaking. Valeria managed to end the date by rejecting Danaposs offer to meet up again, and when she got home, she received a text message from him telling her she was ugly anyway. She said: Because I want to finish my gelato, I agree to go for a walk along the docks. And the whole time he rants about how he hates his mother because she left him and how dating has never worked out for him before. But now itaposs okay because we finally found each other. To change the subject, I point out a kayak and say aposhey, Iaposve always wanted to try that.apos To which he goes, aposNo, kayaks are for poor people.aposI say Iaposm going to go back to my car because itaposs going to rain soon, and he says aposno,you knew anything about the weather, youaposd know that the clouds need to be going in the opposite direction, so youaposre going to keep walking.aposTo which I say sir, Iaposm now going in the opposite direction. I make it to my car, reject his second date offer, and then get a text saying I was ugly anyway when I get home.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralUmm what Dating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, she never anticipated just how successful her side project would be. Within the space of just one month, Annabelle, from Brisbane, Australia, raked in thousands of pounds. She continued to pursue her lucrative side hustle for the next  months in addition to her full-time job, bringing in an extra £, each month on average. However, everything changed when - less than one week after starting a new marketing role - the -year-old was sacked after a colleague reportedly came across her X-rated content and told on her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Looking back on her dismissal, Annabelle is now quite pleased about how things turned out, with her earnings now adding up to around £ a day. Annabelle said: I am pleased to [have been fired] an extent, I’m a lot happier now and have a lot more freedom. Iaposm earning a considerable amount more now than I was at the other job. The morning of the firing I was askedI had any other side businesses and I said no, assuming she [my manager] meant retail side businesses that were tax-deductible. I also couldnapost think of how sheaposd found my OnlyFans as at that stage it was completely unsearchable and Iaposd capped my fans at around , where theyaposd been sitting for about a year. I was sent an email giving me an opportunity to explain myself. Theyaposd written all the reasons why they thought I deserved to have my position terminated. I couldnapost believe it. Annabelle has explained that she was given three reasons for her firing, which included publishing content to an online site with pornographic images, carrying out business without her employeraposs approval, and ly advising her company she had no side sources of income. She believes that one of her co-workers was among her subscribers and that they were the one to show their boss her spicy pictures. Annabelle continued: I didnapost promote my OnlyFans anywhere so I can only assume that someone at my work was subscribed to my OnlyFans and sent the evidence into my boss. It made me furious that someone at the company who subscribed to my page then re-shared my content. She went on to add that a simple conversation would have sufficed. Although the firing came as a shock, Annabelle is now pulling in much more money than she did previously, as she previously earned AUD , a yearat her old marketing job, while she now makes up to , a week , and only has to work around six hours a day.Do you have a similar story to share  We pay for stories.

And one woman on Mumsnet has found her date isnapost interested in playing around when it comes to cutting off people he doesnapost vibe with after he dumped her for eating Maltesers at the cinema. The mum explained her date had bought popcorn for himself while she had opted for a big bag of the malt chocolate treats - and in true cinema fashion, she had opened the bag and started tucking in before the film had started.But her decision to munch on her choccies early was apparently too much for her date to comprehend because he began getting irritated with her, and ultimately chose to dump her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: Iaposve been seeing someone for a few weeks. We went to the cinema last night and he bought popcorn and I bought a big bag of Maltesers. I opened them when we sat down and began eating them. He said aposwhy don’t you wait until the film starts apos, so I just laughed and said apostoo temptingapos as a joke. He seemed irritated and said something like aposyou won’t have any left by time the film startsapos. This got my back up a bit and I just carried on as I was. I finished the bag around  minutes into the film. I saw him watching me and felt his disapproval, but why  It didn’t affect him, he had his popcorn. He was really grumpy throughout the film and afterwards was quite off with me. We were meant to be going for something to eat but he said he wasn’t really in the mood and would be heading home.  The woman then text the man at the end of the night to find out the cause of his change in attitude - and he told her he didnapost think their romance would work out. She added: Before I went to bed I text him askingI’d done something to upset him and he replied, aposI don’t think this will work out, it’s nothing personal.apos I replied, aposOk no worriesapos. It’s been bugging me all day as before we sat down in the cinema he was absolutely fine! We were laughing and joking, no bad feelings at all, and he literally changed as soon as we sat down. Commenters on the Mumsnet post were equally as baffled by the manaposs seemingly high standards, as many of them said she likely had a lucky escape by getting out of the romance quickly. One person wrote: If he dumped you over that, he was probably doing you a huge favour. If I buy popcorn at the cinema, at least half is gone before the film starts. As another said: By the sounds of it youaposve had a lucky escape! Who doesnapost eat at least half the snacks before the film starts!  While a third commented: He sounds awful! I thought everyone tucked into the snacks as soon as they sat down. But someone  disagreed, stating the Maltesers could have just been the last straw. They said: Sounds like it was the last straw, doubt it was over this sorry but sounds like he was already planning on dumping you and every little thing you do is irritating to him.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DatingUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At Ennis District Court, Judge Mary Larkin has directed that Geraldine O’Loughlin deliver her German Shepherd-like dog to the dog warden, due to the continual noise disturbance on a neighbour in Ennis, Co Clare. Judge Larkin made the order in response to an application by Ms O’Loughlin’s neighbour, Shane Shannon of Gort Rd, Ennis, under legislation concerning the control of dogs.Judge Larkin concluded that the barking dog is interfering substantially with Mr Shannon’s le, The Irish Mirror reports. Judge Larkin made the order under a little known provision of the Control of Dogs Act  where a judge can make an order requiring the elimination of a nuisance caused by the “excessive barking” of an unwanted dog. In evidence, Mr Shannon said that the “large dog has been barking for as long as I have been there and that’s  years”.  Mr Shannon said that the dog’s barking would go on all day “for two and a half hour periods at a time”. He said: “The dog has been barking a hundred times a day.” Mr Shannon said that he spoke to Ms O’Loughlin about the dog but the barking continued. In response to his ‘barking concerns’ Mr Shannon said that Ms O’Loughlin told him that is what dogs do. Sure what harm is it” ” He told the court: “She laughed into my face.” Mr Shannon said that he works in horticulture and has a potting shed at the end of his garden but was forced to abandon working there due to the dog constantly barking from the garden next door. Mr Shannon said that the dog meet the definition of an ‘unwanted dog’ under the Act stating that the dog “hasn’t got much affection and I would say he is lonely and not cared for”. He said: “To be honest it is immensely upsetting to listen to an animal like that. He is fed twice a day when food is thrown out the back door to him. I never hear anyone playing with the dog or saying hello to the dog.” Mr Shannon said that the dog was never brought outside the garden over the past  years and never brought into the home. Asked by Judge Larkin what the dog’s name is, Mr Shannon said: “I never heard the dog being called by its name or heard anyone being nice to the dog.” At the outset of the case, Judge Larkin said that the court registrar received an email from Ms O’Loughlin stating that she wouldn’t be coming to court as the dog has been put down. However, Mr Shannon said that he would prefer to press ahead with the case stating “I don’t trust anything she says”. After hearing Mr Shannon’s evidence, Judge Larkin ordered that the dog delivered to the dog warden to be dealt with by him in accordance with Control of Dogs Act as it is an unwanted dog.

Putin was snapped with singer Paul McCartney before a concert in Moscow in , sat with actor Jack Nicholson at the Moscow International Film Festival in  and was even in correspondence with Pamela Anderson. He had drinks with Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio at the International Tiger Conservation Forum in Saint Petersburg in  and shook hands with British supermodel Naomi Campbell at the same event.As well as these celeb acquaintances, Putin has actually developed close friendships with a few Hollywood stars, who have been reacting to Russiaaposs war on Ukraine. Around the world, Putin is losing allies fast with many condemning his terrying invasion and attacks on defenceless civilians, with the Russian leader promising worse is yet to come.So how has this changed the way his famous friends think about him  Steven Seagal Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Hollywood actor Steven Seagal has a surprising friendship with Putin - and has even been to his home. The Under Siege and Hard to Kill star, who received his Russian citizenship in , first bonded with the Russian leader over a shared love of martial arts. The Michigan-born actor has previously described his father as pure Russian, as his paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and he still has some relatives in the country.Unsurprisingly, Seagal did not put any blame on Putin over the Ukraine war and has claimed an outside entity is provoking both countries into fighting.The -year-old martial artist told Fox News Digital that he looks at both Russia and Ukraine as one family. Most of us have friends and family in Russia and Ukraine, he said on Monday as he refused to take sides. I look at both as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other. My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live and thrive together in peace.  Seagal has spoken out in praise of Putin on several occasions, including in a  interview with Russian TV channel RT when he said Putin was one of the greatest world leadersnot the greatest world leader alive today. He went on: The first time I went to his home, I walked in and saw a le-sized statue of Kano Jigoro, who is the founder of judo, so I was immediately taken and impressed and really wanting to get to know this man deeper and deeper. In , Seagal met with Belarusan president Alexander Lukashenko to eat carrots and chat about that yearaposs harvest. That year he was also granted his Russian citizenship, resulting in him being barred from entering Ukraine. This [was his] desire, he had really applied, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced to the press. He had been really persistent for a long time and been asking to grant him citizenship, he is actually renowned for his quite warm feelings toward our country. He never made a secret out of it, at the same time he is quite famous, as you know, actor. In , Seagal appeared on Good Morning Britain live from Moscow to defend Putin amid claims he had influenced the American election.  Speaking about his Russian citizenship, he said: I have lots of relatives in Russia and you know I love Russia, I love the country, I love the people and, you know, I think that one thing that’s sort of not widely known, there are millions and millions of people in America who have dual and multiple citizenship so this is not an uncommon thing. The thing that makes it controversial is all of the propaganda flying, particularly from America about Russia, therefore it becomes kind of a controversial situation. He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid heaposd had many direct dealings with Putin as he lavished praise on the Russian leader. Seagal said: As I’ve said many times I think he’s one of the great world leaders, he’s brilliant, he’s articulate, he’s a great tactician. Him and I started out becoming friends over the martial arts. The martial arts has to do with a lot of things. It’s a philosophy, it gets into the history of tactics and the history of the world and the world in conflict and the world in peace and so him and I basically, we don’t have a political relationship, we really talk about the martial arts and the philosophy and people and dilemmas in le, that kind of thing. American podcaster Joe Rogan recently shared an image of a fake CNN report depicting Seagal wearing special forces unorm and holding a gun. The fake news report tried to claim Seagal was among Russian special forces positioned around the outskirts of Kyiv. Gerard Depardieu  French actor Gerard Depardieu has been one of Putinaposs closest celebrity pals - but their friendship could be coming to an end as he has somewhat surprisingly denounced the fractricidal war. The -year-old, who has starred in Cyrano de Bergerac and  Dalmatians, actually received Russian citizenship after turning his back on his homeland.Depardieu annoyed many of his fellow countrymen by running off to Russia, which was apparently to avoid paying large taxes in France after a highly publicised tax row.Putin himself signed the decree granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu, who described Russia as a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby. The actor responded by writing an open letter saying: I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence. Depardieu travelled to Russia in  to be officially given his Russian passport and had an audience with Putin. The pair shook hands and hugged each other at the meeting in Sochi, although the presidentaposs spokesman said he did not hand over the document personally.  The actor was later invited to set up home in the central Russian region of Mordovia, known for its Stalin-era prison camps. Local governor Vladimir Volkov said Depardieu could choose an apartment or a place to build a house, Interfax news agency reported. After arriving in Mordoviaaposs main city of Saransk, the actor showed off his new passport, saying: I am very happy, itaposs very beautul here. Beautul and soulful people live here. In , Depardieu caused outrage in his native France by appearing in a aposnauseousapos advertisement in which he boasted about shooting a deer and being a Russian. Proud to be Russian said the actor, who was then seen kneeling over a dead dear and blowing a kiss. , the online French news outlet, meanwhile called the advertisement vulgar, while GQ magazine said it was a mixture of nauseous wordplay and pathetic production quality. But now the love-in between Putin and Depardieu may be coming to an end as the the actor denounced Russiaaposs war with Ukraine. In a shock move, the film star posted a photo on Instagram with the message: Russia and Ukraine have always been brother countries.Although he did not call out Putin directly and called on both nations to start negotiating for peace. I am against this fratricidal war, he added. I say, Stop the weapons and negotiate.apos However, the Ukrainian people are unlikely to change their opinion on Depardieu because of his past links. Back in , the Ukrainian government included the French actor on a list of cultural figures who were a threat to the countryaposs security. While no specic reason was stated, it is believed the decision is linked to controversial comments he made questioning Ukraineaposs independence. At the Baltic Pearl movie festival in Latvia in , Depardieu said that he loved both Russia and Ukraine, which is part of Russia.

In the last week alone, it is believed there have been three attempts to take out President Zelensky.Last week, the assassins were said to be awaiting a green light from the Kremlin to move on Mr Zelensky, however the plan was said to be abandoned as they reached the upper echelons of the Ukrainian government. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblogThe assassinations were reportedly foiled when double agents within Russiaaposs Federal Security Service, The Times reported.The underground assassin group are said to have infiltrated Ukraine with a -name aposkill listapos targeting the entire Cabinet - including the mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir.It is widely believed that the group is at the beck and call of Vladimir Putin, although the Kremlin has repeatedly denied this.The force is said to be heavily involved in supplying weapons, experienced operations personnel and military training to pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine. The group has previously been deployed by the Kremlin outside of Russia, to carry out black ops operations that Putin wants done while avoiding direct responsibility.  After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No ”. However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Zelensky vowed to stay and fight for his country in the face of Russian aggressions.Yesterday, president Zelensky urged Putin to sit down with him and talk in order to bring an end to the now eight day invasion.In an address to the Russian leader, Zelensky said: Get off our land. You donapost want to leave now  Then sit down with me at the negotiation table. Iaposm available. Sit. Just not  metres away like with Macron or Scholz etc. I am your neighbour.

What are you afraid of  We arenapost threatening anyone, weaposre not terrorists, we arenapost seizing banks and seizing foreign land.It follows the Ukraine presidentaposs earlier comments, in which he warned Russia would pay for their invasion of the country.He said: We will restore every house, every street, every city and we say to Russia: learn the word of reparations and contributions.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 11 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA misty Argyll castle is the subject of this week#s featured photograph by Sharon Hiley.Sharon captured the atmospheric scene at Tarbert Castle, a much-loved historical site looked after by Tarbert Castle Trust.The castle has ancient royal connections, dating back to the th century.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

Canada and the EU.This will be achieved via an “urgent designation procedure”.The changes also include shortening theof time foreign owners of UK property will be given to declare their true identity as part of a new register of overseas entities, from  months to six months.A further amendment will increase criminal penalties for non-compliance from fines of up to £ per day to up to £, per day.As set out in the existing legislation, other sanctions will include prison sentences of up to five years.Another change will commit the Government to publishing an annual report on the use of Unexplained Wealth Orders .Data on the use of UWOs is already published in the annual Asset Recovery Statistical Bulletin, but the additional report will be laid before Parliament and provide further

largest and strongest sanctions package in our history, but we are not stopping here.“The changes we are making will allow us to go faster and harder on those closest to Putin, including oligarchs, as we continue to ratchet pressure in the face of illegal and unprovoked Russian aggression.”The amendments follow calls from Labour to massively cut theof time foreign owners of property in the UK will be given to declare their true identity, in an effort to “tighten the net on dirty Russian money as soon as possible”.Labour said on Wednesday it wanted to speed up the process of bringing the new register of overseas entities into force, with applications required within  days of the legislation passing.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “We welcome the Government’s U-turn under pressure from Labour to tighten the law so we can move on more oligarchs tied to Putin’s regime, but we must also move faster, acting against these iniduals in ​days not months.”Amendments to the Economic Crime Bill will be expedited through all its Commons stages on Monday, the FCDO said.It added that the Government is looking for “swt passage” in the Lords in order to get royal assent as

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

We can only advertise the whole area, which is very large,’ he explained.‘But a town of this size could do a lot more in the way of advertising.’The caravan sites around Campbeltown are among the best in the west of Scotland, Mr McKinnon added.Caravanning, he says, is up and coming in the popularity stakes among holidaymakers.SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe  miners, who had been on an unofficial strike at the Argyll Colliery, Machrihanish, since Monday afternoon of last week, ed to work on Monday morning.This followed meetings of the Argyll branch of the National Union of Mineworkers and the men involved the previous night.It was decided to go back and await the report of the inspector, who, it was stated, was to make an inspection of the colliery on Wednesday.This inspector is appointed by the National Union of Mineworkers and he acts with full approval of the National Coal Board.The strike was in sympathy with two backsht men who walked out because they alleged that part of the pit, where they were working, was unsafe.However, an inspector of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, who made a thorough inspection of the colliery on Thursday, on the recommendation of the manager Mr James W Williamson, reported that the colliery was perfectly safe and that the method of working was highly satisfactory.Prior to his inspection, the men, at one of their meetings in Campbeltown, claimed that too much coal was being extracted from the section concerned and expressed their fear that it might lead to a major disaster.Mr William Marshall, president of the Argyll branch of the NUM and one of the men involved, denied that the two men who originally stopped work because of the alleged danger were men of little mining experience.He stated that one of these men had  years’ experience in mining in the Blantyre district, while the other man had  years’ experience in another Scottish mining area.He argued that on several occasions the men had to quit the road because of creaking and tearing in the roof which were, he said, the usual signs of danger."},{"url":null,"title":"hoops in whisky barrel sculpture are not in wrong order","story":"Campbeltown resident Fiona Macpherson sent a photograph of the installation to the Courier after noticing that the weathered steel rings did not seem to taper out from each end to the middle like the hoops on a whisky cask, which they are supposed to represent.#I looked at the original drawing from the plans and it looks to me like the hoops are in the wrong order,# she said. #It#s nothing like the artist#s impression of how it was going to look.#But Cosmo Blake, network engagement manager at Sustrans Scotland, said the angle of the specic photograph does make it appear as though the outer ring is wider, but #this is not the case in reality#.#To stay true and accurate to traditional whisky and herring barrels, the #taper# on the outer ring of barrels is much lesser by design,# he added.#We are conscious that the previous rendered artist#s impression images of the rings could not illustrate the final and exact angles of the rings in detail.#Named Am Baraille, the feature is part of a joint project between Sustrans and Argyll and Bute Council.It was built near Campbeltown#s New Quay as a visual marker to welcome visitors arriving into Campbeltown by ferry and to mark the start of Sustrans# -mile Caledonia Way cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness.The six weathered steel rings representing the copper straps of a cask were said to be #informed by community workshops and research of Campbeltown#s whisky and fishing history#.#Art is a fantastic way to spark conversation, create interest and promote unique spaces,# said Mr Blake, #and this artwork, was designed with the local environment and community at its heart.#An interpretation trail, featuring quotes gained from community consultation, leads to and through the sculpture.Ms Macpherson fears these quotes, as they currently are, may be a trip hazard as some of the metal bars on which they are written are sitting slightly proud of the tarmac path.She added: #Also, in the original drawing, the sculpture looks to be set in a sandy surface but it#s actually set in white concrete which is already getting stained, and it#s surrounded by tarmac, neither of which match the surrounding pathways.#It#s an absolute monstrosity, a complete eyesore. With the good news about the new distilleries, we need a better welcome off the ferry than this rusty, bendy barrel.#Mr Blake explained that due to a requirement for drier, warmer weather during installation, as well as the tarmac and concrete requiring  weeks to cure, a final layer of resin-bound material will be laid during spring .#This will bring the level up to the tread plates,# he said.He added that the final ground surface layer was also due for completion in spring.#Once installed, it will result in a colour reflective of the rendered image,# he said.#Sustrans and Argyll and

responsibility for the completed artwork.#The weathered steel materials used are in keeping with the colour of herring and whisky barrel straps, and are incredibly durable which was a key criteria put forward by Argyll and Bute Council, ensuring that the sculpture remains vibrant in the prevailing weather of its coastal location.#The paths, sculpture and materials were all agreed between Sustrans, the artist and Argyll and Bute Council officers prior to designs being submitted for final planning approval, which allowed the wider public the opportunity to comment on these for a further three and a half months through the local authority planning portal.#No objections were received.#An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #The sculpture is managed and owned by Sustrans and was designed

week washed, dried, ironed and folded the first loads of washing through its new laundry service, after moving its headquarters from a former retail shop on Longrow to a unit at Snipefield Industrial Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project. These were then sewed into blankets which have been donated to three dferent charities to help homeless people.‘During lockdown, it was brought to our attention that it wasn’t only older people with dficulties who struggled,’ Joan said. ‘Everyone felt loneliness.‘To that end, we want to invite everyone, including older people, to come and help us at Shopper-Aide, to help support their community.‘Our volunteers come from all walks of le and are truly tremendous. We wouldn’t be where we are today without them.‘Just an hour a week of someone’s spare time would make an amazing dference to us.’Shopper-Aide is looking for volunteers across all areas of the charity’s work, although it should be noted that people must be aged  or over to drive Shopper-Aide’s vehicles.Garry’s Gang, a men-only group that meets twice a week, was the first to resume when Covid restrictions allowed.One attendee told Shopper-Aide staff: ‘I’m not going to die of Covid, I’m going to die of loneliness.’That is why the charity is keen to restart its social groups as soon as possible, initially in bubbles to ensure safety.‘The last two years, we’ve been on hold, the same the rest of society,’ said Joan, ‘but we’re starting to open our wings and are looking forward to getting back to the new normal.’Shopper-Aide has three full-time and  part-time staff who assist and coordinate volunteers.‘Our staff are very committed,’ Joan said. ‘They all do a brilliant job and go above and beyond what’s asked of them.‘The Shopper-Aide family is committed to supporting each other, and we want to become more resilient should something like Covid ever happen again.’As well as volunteering, people can also support the charity by becoming a ‘Shopper-Aide Friend’ by donating £ a year infor newsletters and the knowledge that they’re supporting a charity within the community.Call   or visit Shopper-Aide’s website or Facebook page for more information on the new laundry service or to support the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

We also welcome visitors from across the world to visit and join us in our celebrations.”Angela Howe, director at The RA World Golf Museum, said: “The Open has been played at some of the world’s most historic golf courses and Musselburgh is undoubtedly one of them. As one of the three prestigious venues, with Prestwick and St Andrews, which played host to the early days of The Open and the home course of the great Park family among others, it has a rich golfing heritage. It’s wonderful to see this remarkable milestone being celebrated in such fitting style throughout the year.”Michael Beamish, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers has written records stretching back more than  years. Originally based in Leith and, since , at Muirfield, the club grew and flourished during the period when Musselburgh Links was its home.“Musselburgh Links was the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers from  until . In , The Honourable Company built a clubhouse in Golf Place at the west end of the Links and throughout this period both the town and the nine-hole course played a leading role in the development of the rapidly growing game of golf. Musselburgh and the Links have a long, important and distinguished history and deserve the title ‘The Cradle of Golf.’“The Honourable Company would like to congratulate the clubs at Musselburgh Links and the affiliates involved in managing and maintaining the course, enjoyleisure and East Lothian Council, for such a wonderful golfing legacy, and send very best wishes for the th anniversary celebrations.”John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, said: “The Old Course has a very special place in both East Lothian and Scottish golfing history. Ever since March , the course has been recognised as a wonderful place to play golf and the fact that it is one of only  venues to have hosted The Open is testament to that.“We are very proud of the fact that East Lothian is Scotland’s Golf Coast, with an unparalleled selection of courses, including the Old Course, which golfers continue to enjoy to this day.“I’m delighted that the council and enjoyleisure are working with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club in celebrating this remarkable milestone and I’d like to congratulate all involved as their plans take shape for a year of celebration.”Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, said: “We’re delighted to be marking this signicant milestone in Musselburgh Links’ history, in conjunction with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, Musselburgh Links Ladies Golf Club and East Lothian Council.“It’s an absolute joy to be able to provide public access to this magnicent course witnessing children take their first drive engaging with locals on their ,th round and welcoming international enthusiasts eager to tick off another majestic round on an historic Open Championship course from their bucket list.“Musselburgh Links is truly the people’s golf course which is enjoyed by all ages and abilities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"alan-carr-tickets-grabs-competition-raising-funds-poorly-toddler","story":"One lucky East Lothian

planned.About  staff and more than a hundred contractors are employed at the station, which was due to close in March .That timescale has been brought forward two years and Paul Forrest, new station director, stressed that the immediate focus was on continuing generation but that attention would turn to the future of the station within the next couple of years.He said: “These are big institutions and preparation work needs to start, maybe not now but over the next year or so.“We found our first keyway root crack at our inspections there and it was expected.“We found a keyway root cracking at Hunterston in  and some keyway root cracking at Heysham , our sister station, last year. That is within expectations but what that does do is underpins the  date so I think we are more confident now that that will be the date.“One success we got from the Hunterston end-of-generation is we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay here.“The staff levels do go down, there’s no doubt about it, but I’ve just done it.“Hunterston was the first station of the AGR [advanced gas-cooled reactor] fleet to reach the end of generation. I was there, I saw it all, so I’m well positioned to help Torness on their journey. We will be starting our preparations for that in the next couple of years.”Once the station stops generating power, attention will turn to defueling the reactors.That process is expected to take more than three years and will require hundreds of members of staff.Mr Forrest succeeded Tam Al Bishawi, who has moved to EDF’s new Hinkley C power station in Somerset after  years over two spells at the station.However, the -year-old is no stranger to Torness.He has lived in nearby Dunbar for more than  years and has a connection with the power station dating back more than  years.He was involved in the construction and commissioning of the station and has held ious roles, including operations manager and technical and safety manager.He was also plant manager at Torness for nearly two years from December  to September , when he was appointed acting station director at Hunterston B, near West Kilbride in Ayrshire.The “strong supporter” of nuclear power felt that Torness had an important role to play in the years ahead.The father-of-three said: “I will be painting that picture and, as I said, at Hunterston we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay. If I can replicate that, it would be a real success.“That will be one of my main focuses but right now we are generating electricity for about a quarter of Scotland’s electricity needs and that is low-carbon electricity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"controlled-explosion-item-address-west-barns","story":"An official police statement to the Courier yesterday said that bomb disposal experts had carried out the controlled explosion on Tuesday - but that information was wrong.Apologising for any inconvience caused, a Police Scotland statement this morning said: \"Information initially provided relating to a controlled explosion at the address was inaccurate.

He also helped the council buy the handwritten original Robert Burns manuscript of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ in  for around £,.“It came up for sale in New York and one of the library staff said to me this was happening,” said Mrs McConnell. “They said we have this amazing Burns collection but you never buy anything in Glasgow for the libraries and I thought why not “We went out and we got that manuscript at auction in New York and it is now in Glasgow. That has been at the heart of what we have been able to do. It has been about working with others and seeing opportunities as they arise. In the face of it when I started in  having lost all that money from Strathclyde and sadly we did have to make a lot of compulsory redundancies at the time, the reality iswe hadn’t gone into partnership with others and hadn’t changed how we did things we wouldn’t have had the credibility or the partners to do a lot of what we did.”It was former city council chief executive George Black who recognised that the halcyon days would not last forever and understood what was coming down the line in terms of the scale of investment for services and reductions in local government funding.In  that it was felt for culture and leisure to be successful a new way of working had to be looked and also to reduce the burden to the council given increasing demands on the likes of social care and education budgets.  This led to the setting up of Glasgow Le in , a charitable organisation that could run culture and leisure on behalf of the council, and brought an immediate saving to the council of tens of millions of pounds just in rates, along with VAT benefits.“We also recognised it would be a way of bringing in people like Lord Macfarlane on to our board,” added Mrs McConnell. “We saw this as an opportunity immediately to save money year in year out – one off saving isn’t enough and we needed to bring in people who could help us bring in additional money.”Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingGlasgow’s cultural and sporting successes propelled the city’s global reputation as a first choice leisure and business tourism destination. In , before the pandemic struck, Glasgow welcomed some . million domestic and international visitors boosting the city’s economy by a record £m and supporting thousands of jobs across every part of Glasgow’s tourism and hospitality sector.However, the pandemic meant the doors to Glasgow Le’s venues were closed and it was facing a financial black hole. It lost £m due to the pandemic and estimated revenue for   was £.m. With services and cultural attractions at risk, it led to The Herald launching A Fair Deal for Glasgow campaign calling for both the UK and Scottish government to support a new way of funding these treasures.So how does she think Glasgow can best funds its cultural offering in the years ahead.“Glasgow isn’t just like any other local authority. It is dferent. It is the biggest city and is home to so many cultural services and resources that it directly funds through Glasgow Le, but the whole ecology whether it is support for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, based in one of the city’s venues or the Glasgow Warriors playing at Scotstoun, it goes beyond direct funding. I believe there needs to be recognition that some of these services are nationally and internationally signicant and should be funded accordingly,” said Mrs McConnell.“I think we need to look at a dferent view of public health. It can’t just be about campaigns to stop smoking, it needs to be about how can you live a healthy le in your community and that means local resources, services whether it is libraries, sports, or development staff. We need advocates to look at ideas for the future and there needs to be a sense of urgency that we need to do something more.”  Her passion for culture and widening access, she says, stems from its ability to change people’s lives and goes back generations for Mrs McConnell whose inspiration was her grandmother Bridget Airlie, whose name appears on a remembrance plaque in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.“My grandmother was a miner’s we, had seven children and her father before her was a miner. She had six daughters and one son who was killed in the pits.“She was born in  and lived until she was . She had a huge family who were involved in the pits. Relatives had died from having lung disease – I had great uncles who were like demi-gods - grumpy and gruff - but I loved them and the stories they would tell as boys being in a pit at the age of  crawling in areas which were ft high.“Her passion was for education and my memory of her was stick in at school as this was the way out of the pits for her. For me history from  right through the th century wasn’t just in a book. I heard it and lived it listening to these people. I can remember my Uncle Thomas, who was killed in the pits when he was , his we was pregnant at the time and lost the baby, he would listen to opera such as La Traviata.“I remember during the miners’ strike, I had a lot of relations who were involved in that, there was always this dilemma – there was the pride of the mining communities but actually they didn’t want that for their kids. They wanted somewhere where they could breathe, live and they could use their brains. The thing that really struck me about my gran, who was in service as a young girl, was her teacher trying to plead with her parents about to let her stay on at school, but they were poor. Being in service wasn’t like being in Upstairs Downstairs, I think it was pretty miserable, but here was this bright woman who could recite Wordsworth and there was this sense of a great mind not challenged enough so she lived it through her children and grandchildren. The mantra for her was education, education, education. There was a passion about access to arts and that it should be there for everyone and that still drives me to this day.”  While she recognises she is extremely privileged now, she was brought up in a room and kitchen with her siblings and an outside toilet shared with another family, but she said she never once felt poor.“I felt rich and it was rich in community, the church was a big thing for us and lot of the social le, entertainment and arts experiences stemmed from there. I ended up playing organ in the Twechar Church for six years from the age of  because my gran had bought the organ in memory of her late son. I can remember the opportunities there were growing up. If I hadn’t had a full grant when I went to university I wouldn’t have been able to go.”Her first job after leaving St Andrew’s University was with Fe Council’s travelling art gallery in .  Despite the headline grabbing achievements of multi-million pound museums opening and her role in helping to bring the Commonwealth Games to the city in , which she is immensely proud of, it is some of the initiatives that have been le-changing that mean the most.“For me it is the little things. We were doing some work at the library in Bridgeton and one man talked about how the library saved his le. He had lost his job, felt suicidal, and it wasn’t just that the library provided a safe space, it is the moment when it gave a reason for living.“Seeing the change in some of the young people from the criminal justice reform programme volunteering at the Commonwealth Games – it was a moment when you see how culture and sport can change lives.\"As she looks to the future what’s next for Mrs McConnell – does she see a future in politics. And her response was not a yes, no or maybe – it was a never.“It is not a no – it is a never,\" she declared. \"Politics doesn’t appeal partly because I like to change my mind a lot, but I also have found that across all the political parties it is about being able to work with a common interest in doing more for local communities and for people. If you can work with that across parties as sometimes my experience is that parties can create ides, so no it is a never for me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scott-dixon-finds-golf-zen-new-journey-world-yoga","story":"Scott Dixon, the long-serving professional at Dalmahoy, knows a thing or two about being all at sea with this furiously fickle game. Thankfully, however, he found a calming port amid the tempest and is now looking to help others chart a smoother golfing course with a number of two-day, residential wellness retreats at the Kirknewton-based hotel and country club.Building on the game’s recent boom, while promoting its wider benefits for body and mind in these covid-ravaged times, Dixon will encourage golfers and stressed-out souls to channel their inner Zen through a holistic package that merges physical action with spiritual awareness.The -year-old’s initial journey into mindfulness wasnt quite some intrepid venture that The Beatles used to embark on when they sought the wisdom of the Maharishi. Instead, it began much closer to home.“It’s a long story,” said Dixon. “My golf was in such a terrible state. I’d been for lots of technical lessons but had just tied myself in knots. I had such pain in my game and was trying so hard and shooting s. I almost needed counselling for my golf.  I didn’t know how to play anymore and I got the full game yips. I felt like a fraud because I was a professional giving lessons but I couldn’t actually do what I was coaching people.“About  years ago, one of the members at the club said to me, ‘I’m playing golf with a monk tomorrow’. I was intrigued and joined them. He was a normal guy – he worked in computers - but he had committed himself to a certain way of teaching meditation. He gave me a meditation lesson, I gave him a golf lesson and that’s how it started.”In the years that followed, Dixon would become completely immersed in a new way of living.“I went on a six-month training course to become a monk in a retreat up in a mountain in Spain,” he explained of a path one can’t imagine good old Monty veering off down. “When I commit to something, I tend to go all in. It’s not half-assed. At the time, it was the best thing I had ever done. I found peace. It got to the stage where my nervous system would be so relaxed, I’d hardly need to sleep. I could meditate for  hours.“I do breathing techniques, I meditate, I do yoga. Once you start the journey there is so much to explore. Initially, I was doing all this to get better at golf but I realised it was helping me get better at practising le.”While this correspondent’s contemplative repertoire tends to be limited to a muttering, cursing glower to the heavens after hoiking one off the hosel, Dixon’s deep, tranquil, restorative approach is something he is keen to nurture in others to help them become more present and focussed golfers.“Where is your attention when you’re standing over the ball ”, asked Dixon as he pondered the mental fog that can easily cloud the golfing judgement. “Are you in your head with a bunch of thoughts and worries or are you present with the club and feeling what it’s doing and what your body is doing ”The on-going pandemic has impacted everybody in some way. Dixon, who has been at Dalmahoy for  years, has not been immune to its burdens but his soothing disciplines have provided a comforting crutch. For those who sign up to his retreats, Dixon hopes he can enhance both their golf and their lives.“Just because I do all these techniques it doesn’t mean I wake up every morning with birds singing and the sun shining,” he said. “I had some tough times during lockdown but I have a support network I can call on.“We all need to take time to look after ourselves. If you don’t, you’ll never thrive in whatever you do. If you want to be a good golfer, you have to look after yourself. If you want to be happy, you have to take time to look after yourself. Hopefully, I can help.”Dixon’s sanctuary sounds like the perfect escape."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Over the past week,  cases were recorded, bringing the case total since the pandemic began to ,.Following a meeting of the Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordination Group , on Monday morning, vice-chair of the group and corporate director Neighbourhood Services and Infrastructure, Hayley Green, said:“As the UK and Scottish Governments move forward with their plans for ‘living safely with COVID’, which includes a lessening and doing away with restrictions depending on whether you are north or south of the border, we, in Orkney, are facing something of a dilemma given that we are behind the curve.“We are seeing very high rates of transmission, and this is impacting heavily across our services – most notably within the care sector and our schools and nurseries – but really most areas are now being affected given the level of positive cases and the requirement for isolation.“We have reached the point in schools and nurseries whereby we have exhausted supply staff as a contingency and middle and senior staff, including head teachers, who were helping to keep classes open by teaching themselves or taking on janitorial or cleaning duties for example, are now also off due to COVID and other sickness.“Not only are children off due to catching the virus, but others are having to stay home due to a lack of staff – this is having a negative knock-on effect on working parents who are having to either work from homethat is possible or take time off when it is not.“It has also become apparent that we are now witnessing children in schools who have become infected for a second time.”The council stressed that schools are trying to ensure remote learning can be provided when possible – and there are enough staff to make it happen.Within adult care services, many are now feeling the impact and as a result two of our older people’s day care services on the Mainland will be closed from Wednesday as staff are deployed to assist within residential care homes. Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these. Particularly before meeting up with family, friends, travelling and attending events.“Logging lateral flow results is just as important and we ask you all to log both negative and positive results. When a positive lateral flow test is logged you will then receive information on isolation etc.“We’re continuing to ask all NHSO health care staff to continue with lateral flow testing when coming to work and this will be in place for the time being.”You can log your results by visiting: www.gov.uk report-covid-resultcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But they have got to go further and faster.”Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds also told Sky News the UK has got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Mr Putin.But Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast “we’ve not been slow” on sanctions.“We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies,” he said.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

In it#s submission to DfC#s consultation, the AIR said members have “concerns that the adoption of the draft Codes of Practice would have a drastic effect on the income that they currently receive from bookmakers which, in turn, comprises such a signicant share of their funding that it could call into question their continued existence”.Down Royal Racecourse chief Emma Meehan said horse racing is in a unique sporting position, in that it and betting are inter-dependent with most of their revenue streams linked to betting.Whilst we agree the act needs modernising and developing to ensure it is fit for the modern age in a sector that has been transformed through the rise of mobile and online gaming, we are gravely concerned over the potential impact this proposed legislation will have upon the future of horse racing within Northern Ireland a sport that is still recovering from the financial implications of Covid-,” she said.DfC said: The Minister is currently bringing a Bill – The Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill through the Assembly.“The Bill includes a power to allow the Department to issue Codes of Practice. A pre-design engagement consultation was conducted on a draft Code of Practice and closed on February .The department is currently analysing the responses with a view to revising the Code of Practice and issuing for a further formal consultation later in the year.

I heard them say it was a Drontheim.“It looks to be a substantial boat, ft long, maybe longer, and probably travelled along the coast. But how it got there is anyone’s guess. Maybe it sank at some stage.”Chairman of Portrush Heritage Group John McNally said it was possible the boat had been beached at low tide and left there.“It wasn’t necessarily shipwrecked, but we don’t know what happened only that it’s never been seen by locals in living memory,” he explained.“We don’t normally see these sorts of exceptionally low sand levels but recently we’ve had three major storms that dragged sand away from the beach.“It’s a once in a letime exposure, really.

How we build our homes also needs a step change.Commitment from all political parties is required to invest in Modern Methods of Construction to ensure the delivery of energy-saving homes at speed. It is extremely important that action is taken to ensure tenants can live comfortably.”Information on the government energy support schemes is available at www.nidirect.gov.uk covid--energy-debt-advice.Related topicsCost of LivingMore On Cost of LivingRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two years PremiumRalph HewittOpinionHow the Ukraine conflict is starting to hit home – and we are all paying for itHow you can save money on household bills as costs spiral of controlCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfallMallon freezes public transport fares to ease impact of rising costs on familiesMost ReadDays into £,-a-day job, NI’s most expensive council boss goes off sick, plunging council into fresh turmoilRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsNorthern Ireland’s only nuclear bunker taken off the market over safety concernsSands of time blown away to reveal boat from s in PortrushMagherafelt man who filmed woman performing sex act on him in toilets found guilty of voyeurismTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayVideo: Funeral of Pat Cardy, mother of murdered schoolgirl Jenner Cardy, takes place inHillsborough PlayThe mother of Belfast schoolboy Noah Donohoe has urged the PSNI to release all the information relating to her son’s death.Latest Northern IrelandLinfield back on top of the Irish Premiership after Chris McKee’s cheeky back-heel goal helps down CarrickJamie McDonagh has decisive say to boost Cltonville’s Irish Cup hopesStop dragging your feet over refugees from Ukraine, MLA tells ExecutiveCampaigners erect Grenfell billboard outside Ulster Rugby’s Ravenhill stadiumSir Jeffrey Donaldson – DUP’s door is open to departing councillorLatestCricket world mourns death of Australia great Shane WarneWhat the papers say – March North Korea fires suspected ballistic missile into seaInfluencer calls for direct donations to Ukraine through Airbnb bookingsWe feel abandoned by the West: Ukrainian MP condemns UK and US response to war,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic. We pray for peace in the world, especially the tragic war being waged by Russia in the Ukraine.ldquoWhatever is happening or has happened in our lives we all need the mercy and healing touch of God. All are welcome to join our Novena in person or online at our Downpatrick parish facebook page. Services are also being streamed on St Patrickrsquos Parish at Itech Media.A representative of Koinonia, the community of John the Baptist, will speak about Jesus as healer on March .The Novena will include a lsquoSlemish Dayrsquo of prayer and fasting on March  in imitation of Patrick. Mass will be celebrated that evening by Bishop Paul McAleenan.Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, who now live a contemplative le as Poor Clares in County Louth, said it was an honour toto St Patrickrsquos for this special occasion.Just like St Paul, we met unusual kindness from the Christians in Downpatrick when we came to live in the parish in , Sr Martina said.ldquoSt Patrickrsquos spirit is very much alive and active and his impact cannot be underestimated.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands. They initiated, researched, wrote and published a recipe book, Food for Friends, in ,with all profits going to the Friends.Many facets of the High Cross project were supported by the Friends, including filming the whole project and the making of the replica High Cross. Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size,

An initial , bricks will be available.The initiative allows people to purchase bricks mdash priced pound each mdash to invest in the future of Loughinisland GAC and fast-track plans towards building a more modern environment at the club.Each purchased brick will be fitted with a stainless steel plaque placed on a frame which will be prominent on the gable wall of the clubhouse.The plaque can be inscribed with a name, family name or business and location to be displayed forever as a reminder of those who contributed to the success of the plans.When development work has been completed the wall will be moved to a secure site close to the new pitches.For more information on the pitch or to submit a feedback form email loughinislandgacnewpitch@gmail.Alternatively, feedback forms can also be filled out on the clubrsquos website by visiting http:www.loughinislandgac..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Matthew gets his second highest score from judges  ","story":"LOVE Island heart-throb Matthew MacNabb has got through to the final six of RTErsquoS Dancing With The Stars mdash and is dating a new girlfriend.The Downpatrick man impressed the judges on Sunday evening with his strong Paso Doble for its ldquogreat characterisation.The dance with professional dance partner Laura Nolan is inspired by the movements of a Spanish matador and bull.The  year-old gave a passionate performance in the dramatic dance to the song, Live and Let Die by Wings in the showrsquos Big Band week played by the RTE Orchestra.He told the Recorder: ldquoI loved this week.

We should not be having a war in a modern European society.Mr Poxon said he met many of his daughter-in-lawrsquos relatives and friends whwen she married their son in  mdash the couple met while at university in Nottingham mdash and that Olga and her parents attended a Christmas Eve carol service in Down Cathedral last year.He also revealed that he and his we were members of the Belfast Philharmonic Choir which sang in the city of Lviv in western Ukraine some time ago.ldquoBoth at Markrsquos wedding and in Lviv we met many Ukrainians and today our heart goes out to them, he said.ldquoMany of those people who we met sang to or danced with may well be standing in fields, villages, towns or cities with weapons in their hands, hiding in shelters or fleeing for their lives to the borders of friendly states.ldquoIn Lviv we met Marta who was our guide to the city. She spoke passionately, but without malice, on the history of Ukraine and how over its history it had been occupied by Poland, Nazi Germany and Russia.ldquoDuring our tour she took us to a church where we saw strings of white paper doves ascending to heaven, each one representing a le lost in the conflict since , and a board of photographs of young men and women who had also given their lives for their country.

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Sanctions will not stop the invasion but nor are they irrelevant to overall course of this sudden international crisis.As Mr Wilson wrote, the clampdown on Russian dirty money needs to go further.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported exclusively on our sister site The National on St Davids Day, the Cardf Capital Regiongroup of local authorities has bought the site of Wales last coal-fired power station for £ million. CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But they have got to go further and faster.”Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds also told Sky News the UK has got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Mr Putin.But Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast “we’ve not been slow” on sanctions.“We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies,” he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK  ubolstering u sanctions with  unew powers u to move further and faster, PM says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
