Government guidelines published on Monday said this could be allowed in July if the virus appears to be under control.Starbucks said it would reopen 150 branches on Thursday, with customers able to buy coffee to take away or for delivery, while Burger King stepped up its phased reopening, with an extra 35 branches offering drive-through collection or delivery.They joined other large chains that had already reopened some of their outlets or announced plans to do so this week.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.Contactless payments, plastic screens and a ban on reusable cups are among the measures being put in place to protect customers and workers as the businesses reopen their doors.The government plan for rebuilding the economy, released on Monday, said food providers, pubs and accommodation, as well as hairdressers, cinemas and places of worship would reopen “no earlier than 4 July”.However, the document said that when this phase arrived, “some venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove difficult to enact distancing may still not be able to reopen safely at this point”.The trade body UK Hospitality said it was drawing up rules to help its members operate safely at that point.Its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: “The size and ersity of the hospitality sector means that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reopening … Even within the same sector, there is bound to be a huge difference in the size, shape, location and layout of outwardly similar businesses.”Starbucks said that since it shut in March it had been “testing and refining” safety procedures”, learning from what it had seen in China and the US, where the majority of its branches are now open.Customers will be encouraged to order online in advance and given staggered times to collect their orders. Employees have been told that customers waiting to collect an order should do so in a designated area where there is space for social distancing or, if this is not possible, only be allowed into shops one at a time.In a message to employees published on its website, Alex Rayner, Starbucks’ UK retail general manager, said the goal was to be fully open by the end of June “but we will take our time, adapting to customer behaviour and in-store capabilities along the way”.Burger King said it planned to reopen a further 72 branches next Monday and 40 a week after that. These will be for delivery or in a drive-through format only.The chain has provided staff with masks and gloves and given them training on distancing measures. It said stringent cleaning and contactless delivery options were also in place.Pret a Manger on Monday reopened a further 70 shops in London and other major cities and towns including Birmingham, Brighton, Cambridge and Oxford. It is now offering a delivery and takeaway service from more than 100 outlets.McDonald’s plans to reopen 15 sites in south-east England this Wednesday.It has reduced its menu to make distancing easier in its kitchens, and introduced Perspex screens and floor markings where necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97520a5573edd83cfa91340cd221e4f581b9d665/0_99_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=027b4ad517a3045b763951d800f0779f","title":"huge demand for cycles during lockdown set to rise further","story":"The coronavirus lockdown has led to a boom in bicycle sales that appears set to accelerate as the government encourages people to cycle to work after easing restrictions.Many small independent cycle stores have sold their entire stock in recent weeks, and are waiting for new stock to be delivered.Broadribb Cycles in Bicester, which normally sells 20-30 bikes a week, is now selling 50 bikes every day. Brompton said its sales were at Christmas levels even before ministers started promoting cycling as a way out of lockdown.Evans Cycles said it has seen an “unprecedented demand” for bikes and now has a two-week wait for models to be delivered.Independent mechanics have been run off their feet by people asking for old bikes to be serviced to allow them to get back on the road.Meanwhile, cycle-to-work schemes that give tax benefits to employees to buy a new bike from official stores have reported a doubling in sales – a figure that is expected to rise even further as workers realise they can get a new bike without an upfront payment.“There has been a huge increase in cycling during the lockdown, but even so there are millions of people in our towns and cities who have bikes they never or seldom use,” said Graham Stapleton, the chief executive of Halfords. “For the good of our health, the environment and the NHS, now is the time for commuters to change their habits and start cycling to work.”Cities around the world have been rushing through improvements to cycling infrastructure, and cycle groups are waiting to see how UK councils respond.In Germany, expanded cycle lanes have been marked by removable tape and mobile signs. Paris is rolling out 650km (400 miles) of cycleways, including a number of pop-up “corona cycleways”.On Saturday, the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, set out an ambitious £2bn programme to expand cycling and walking, including an immediate £250m fund for infrastructure improvements and a voucher scheme for cycle repairs.In Australia bikes have become the new toilet paper, with retailers struggling to keep up with demand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb43a9ee9e8a18266ef5d7667a6d2275749357e/0_118_5279_3169/master/5279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e26c33c65c27aee63ffa39eb90b846c","title":"no hotel buffets when holidays resume says tour operator tui","story":"Food will be served by masked staff after coronavirus travel restrictions liftedThe travel group Tui has published detailed plans for how it will run its hotels after coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted, including limits on popular self-service buffets and a ban on football tournaments.The UK’s biggest tour operator, which specialises in package holidays, plans to introduce the measures across all its own-brand hotels and make them “available” to joint-venture and partner hotels.The 10-point plan, which will be implemented when strict coronavirus restrictions end, include reducing all-you-can eat buffets “to a minimum”.“Self-service offers such as buffets will be reduced to a minimum,” the company said. “Wherever possible, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks.”Guests at Tui’s 400 hotels will also find their range of entertainment and activities curtailed to maintain physical distancing.“Only events, sports and entertainment involving a small number of participants and without close contact will be made available,” Tui’s new rules state. “Golf or tennis, for example, can take place, but football tournaments cannot.”Other measures include a push to online check-ins and employees keeping a 1.5m distance from guests in public areas such as restaurants, gyms and corridors. Tables in restaurants, which will operate at a “significantly” reduced capacity with longer hours to spread guest usage, will “only be cleaned when guests have vacated them”.More disinfectant dispensers will be made available throughout Tui’s hotels, while “extensive new cleaning practices” will be put in place for rooms. Areas such as bathrooms and heavily used devices such as TV remote controls “will receive particular attention”.“Customer surveys clearly indicate that safety and hygiene will be of paramount importance for holidaymakers after the lockdown,” said Sebastian Ebel, a member of the group’s executive board. “We are laying the foundations for an agile and safe return to business so we can be ready to offer our unique holiday experiences again as soon as possible.”Tui said that it will be training all of its employees at its own hotels, starting this week. At partner hotels not operated by Tui, there will be a training and inspection programme using the hygiene and safety consultancy Cristal International Standards.Tui said that its 10-point plan is in addition to statutory regulations at any holiday destination where it operates.The company also said that the destination measures it has published form part of a wider package that includes plans in its retail outlets, flights, transfers to hotels, local excursions offered to holidaymakers and cruises.“With this set of measures we are creating a framework required to ensure we can offer our guests enjoyable and safe holiday experiences as soon as travel restrictions are lifted,” said Ebel.Tui has been forced to cancel trips affecting almost 1 million holidaymakers. At the end of last month the company cancelled all beach holidays involving travel on or before 11 June.Cruises later in the year are also affected after the company postponed the launch of Tui River Cruises until 26 November.

For generations of Conservative politicians schooled in the dogmas of Thatcherism, the phrase came to connote unpleasant images of sandwiches with union leaders in No 10 and weak government.Boris Johnson urgently needs to discover the virtues of consensus-building now, after a chaotic few days of mixed messages and confused assertions.In parliament on Monday, the prime minister rightly said that, in its battle with the coronavirus pandemic, the country had “begun the descent from the peak, but our journey has reached the most perilous moment”. As certain parts of the economy begin to be opened up, the dire risk of a second wave of infections is real. In Germany, which significantly relaxed lockdown measures last week, the reproduction rate of the virus has apparently crept back over the crucial figure of one already.It was wrong that the first minister of Scotland should learn first from a Sunday newspaper that Mr Johnson intended to replace the “stay at home” message with a new injunction to “stay alert”, along with the “emphasis” on encouraging people back to work. Ms Sturgeon swiftly rejected the strategy as “catastrophic” for Scotland given its current rate of viral transmission. Wales too will stick with the previous message and guidance. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester – who has lobbied without success for the English regions to have a presence in Cobra discussions on the crisis – has expressed similar misgivings. A messy, ragged exit from lockdown across the United Kingdom is in no one’s interest, but by acting as he has, Mr Johnson has increased the likelihood of that.The trade unions, having collaborated successfully with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in devising the job-retention scheme, must now be wholly included in the back-to-work process. They were blindsided on Sunday evening, when the prime minister seemed to imply that employees not able to work at home might return to factories and construction sites as soon as the following morning. It transpired that the new government guidelines will in fact apply from Wednesday, and to a broader sweep of workplaces, including food production and scientific research centres. But in a 60 page roadmap, published on Monday, there appears to be little concession to union requests for enforceable safety standards. Reassurance over the availability of personal protective equipment at the workplace was inadequate, and there is insufficient clarity for parents with childcare responsibilities, who may now feel pressured to go to work. To a considerable extent, the government appears to be relying on employers to do the right thing. Some employees may choose not to take that risk.The list of concerns goes on. If public transport is the only means to get to work, should an employee take it? Police forces have complained that the sheer fuzziness of the “stay alert” message could make enforcing the new legislation impossible in some circumstances.None of this, of course, is easy. The prime minister is simultaneously confronted with a public health crisis and an unfolding economic disaster which he must address. This is a delicate and dangerous balancing act. But it is not enough to invoke “good solid British common sense”, as the prime minister did on Monday, and hope everything works out. The country needs a post-lockdown strategy it can understand and unite around. So far Mr Johnson has not given it one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/438cbe981303644a15abddcb052275af1750d606/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3a13db74cbd27371da1c27801ec3bf","title":"connells chain untangled its comparable to james deans t shirt in the 1950s","story":"As the sale of men’s jewellery rockets, we find out how the star of Normal People is fuelling Zoom’s ‘top half’ statement dressingThe question of ratings success of BBC Three’s Normal People is one thing – record breaking numbers for the show on iPlayer, doubling Killing Eve’s previous record – but the question of who, or what, is the breakout star is quite another.As nuanced and subtle as the performances by the show’s two leads (Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne and Paul Mescal as Connell) are, the internet has decided that the real star of the show is a necklace.The simple chain necklace, worn by Mescal’s Connell has been called “the sexiest thing” about the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s acclaimed novel by The Cut. Meanwhile, an Instagram account Connells Chain, which posts pictures of Mescal wearing the item, has gained over 25,000 followers including model Adwoa Aboah. And the show’s costume designer tells the  that Mescal’s wearing of the silver chain is “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt in the 1950s”.So what makes it the most eroticised inanimate screen object since Chris Evans’ jumper in Knives Out? “The chain holds a different kind of appeal,” says Billie Bhatia, curator of the Instagram account. “It’s innately strong and masculine but brings a sensual softness to Connell.” She adds that the iconic items of men’s jewellery on screen (think Leonardo DiCaprio’s cross in Romeo + Juliet, Jake Gyllenhaal’s dog tags in Jarhead, Heath Ledger’s silver link chain in 10 Things I Hate About You and Timothée Chalamet in Call Me By Your Name) are “noticeable but not overwhelming, subtle but distinct”.To capture what Rooney called “Argos chic” costume designer Lorna Marie Mugan says she didn’t spend much money. “We had a selection of classic silver chains and Paul chose his favourite. He must have sensed its magic powers.” She wanted to build on the idea, from the novel, that it was something he has had since school. “So it had to be simple and fine enough that he could have worn it under a school shirt,” she says. “Silver jewellery appeals to young people more than gold. Anything too heavy may have had different connotations, like gangster, or image conscious, which was not the character. It has a quiet elegant presence, like Connell. Not flashy, just classic.”As good as the necklace might be, Bhatia admits that a healthy dose of lockdown lust has exacerbated its viral appeal. “The chain would have been popular in its own merit, but quarantine has certainly exacerbated people’s frustration and they have taken some of that out on the chain.”The appearance of adornments like necklaces on the “top half” have become important parts of statement dressing in Zoom calls. “A man who slides into view wearing jewellery is reminding you that he hasn’t given up, that there’s more to him than isolated homeworker killing time between dishwasher loads,” says fashion writer Justin Myers. “It speaks not just to professionalism but pride.”Normal People has bolstered a trend in men’s jewellery that has been bubbling under in fashion for a while. In December, American GQ declared that “gold chains were the new neck ties”, with celebrities like Justin Theroux and Ryan Gosling adopting the look. Meanwhile, Harry Styles, Kieran Culkin and A$AP Rocky have normalised the wearing of pearl earrings and baroque rings. On the catwalk, menswear shows from Dior, Gucci and McQueen have seen more focus on jewellery adornments too.“There is certainly consumer demand for more male jewellery options,” says Chana Baram, Senior Retail Analyst at Mintel. “Tiffany launched its first male collection in October 2019, Bulgari introduced a new unisex range of studded rings in February and Astrid \u0026amp Miyu released a unisex collection in January 2019.”Still, men have been wearing jewellery through history, from the ancient Greeks to the Mughal Maharajas and the Tudor era. “Jewellery from the earliest centuries has never been just about personal adornment,” explains James Sherwood author of Jewelry For Gentlemen. “It is about portable property. When regimes and monarchies fall, your jewels can easily be swallowed or spirited away concealed in garments. Wearing money – real or imitation – on one’s body was of course an imposition of power not taste, hence Henry VIII wearing a ruby knuckleduster on every finger of every hand rather than, say, a royal signet ring.”Sherwood adds that the way men wear jewellery now is more democratic. “Jewellery is no longer just for kings, emperors and princes,” he says. “It is for any man with swagger and style.”Rosh Mahtani, founder and designer of jewellery label Alighieri, says: “Anthropologically, jewellery, and its rich symbolic nature, is a completely universal language.” It s centuries, from pirates to hunters in Masai tribes, wearing talismen around their necks, she explains. “I think it’s part of a wider conversation around men feeling more able to express themselves without judgment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86d7acb4cd4e4e00bb564a127d2ca5e0d9621cf1/0_129_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad9133ef0edf0c946ed9acd7718d1e9","title":"the magnificent one how little richards style shaped david bowie prince and elton john","story":"The musician, who died on Saturday aged 87, was a pioneer in looks as well as sounds, influencing everything from James Brown’s quiff to Prince’s midriff‘Little Richard scared my grandmother in 1957,” wrote John Waters in 2010. While his grandmother’s fear was largely about the singer’s sound – that trademark shriek at the start of his hit Lucille – his look had a formative impact on the 11-year-old Waters. It is thanks to Little Richard that the film director has the deliciously fake pencil-thin moustache that his fans know and love today.Waters’ moustache is just one example of Little Richard’s influence on fashion and style. Images of Little Richard, born Richard Penniman, in his 5os heyday show a proud, decade-appropriate quiff – forget Chuck Berry and Elvis, this was the best in the business – plus a mascara-ed moustache, panstick makeup and the look of kohl around his eyes. James Brown, who was a Little Richard impersonator, learned the power of good hair from him. The Godfather of Soul began his career in the late 50s with a quiff worthy of Little Richard.The kohl and panstick makeup gave clues to Little Richard’s journey. He was thrown out of home at the age of 13 some writers – and even sometimes Little Richard – argued this was down to homophobia, with his father taking offence at his son’s queerness (he later said he was “omnisexual”, before denouncing this term). The teenager then spent time as a drag queen, taking the stage name Princess Lavonne. “I used to call myself at the time the Magnificent One,” Little Richard says to Waters of his early career. “I was wearing makeup and eyelashes when no men were wearing that.” He called himself “the king and queen of rock’n’roll”.Little Richard was light years ahead of his contemporaries when it came to experimenting with fashion as part of his image – to celebrate flamboyance, to be a complete rock star. His first outfits were smart, boxy suits but not the kind for work. These came with wide-legged trousers that allowed movement, such as slamming a brogue on to the piano. He later wore wigs – to make that tonsorial statement even more impressive – along with sparkles, crop tops, jumpsuits and headbands. He was the blueprint for the anything-goes permissiveness that developed on stage over the coming decades.While his career was suspended when Little Richard retired from showbusiness for religion in 1957, a return to live performance in the 60s coincided with the emergence of a new generation of musicians. This is when Little Richard’s showman style began to develop. He toured Europe in the first half of the 60s, with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles supporting him. They learned from Little Richard how to own the pomp of rock stardom. “Mick Jagger used to watch my act,” he once said. “Where do you think he got that walk?”Elton John, meanwhile, supported him as part of the band Bluesology in 1967 and no doubt took note of the winning combination of wild outfit and wild piano playing. And Jimi Hendrix, a man destined for many “rock star style” Pinterest boards? He played guitar in Little Richard’s band.By the 70s, Little Richard was wearing Rudi Gernreich-style onesies at airports, sequinned kaftans on TV and tie-up blouses on stage. The guitarist Steve Van Zandt, in his tribute to Little Richard, said that part of his legacy was a “flamboyant androgyny which would become an essential part of rock’n’roll”.David Bowie and Prince are often – rightly – cited as music’s great fashion innovators, playing with gender in fashion and pushing the boundaries when it comes to the optics of male sexuality. Both owe debts to Little Richard – and acknowledge them.“Little Richard was just unreal,” Bowie told Rolling Stone. “Unreal. Man, we’d never seen anything like that.” Prince, meanwhile, paid tribute in looks. On the cover of his 1986 album Parade, he is photographed in a crop top, with quiff, mascara and pencil moustache. Little Richard took the compliment, and added a bit of shade. “Prince is the Little Richard of his generation,” he told Joan Rivers in 1989, turning to the camera to address Prince himself: “I was wearing purple before you was wearing it!”With more modern performers, such as Bruno Mars and Janelle Monáe, still referencing Little Richard, his status as a style pioneer is in no doubt – more than 60 years after he scared Waters’ grandmother."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba48de721006f4bc4f0b9d5d7e6fee5d58fcdc2/1_0_617_370/master/617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6ffb3847b637ef2c812966c98410602","title":"capone review tom hardy entertainingly feral as a gangster at the end of the road","story":"Fantastic Four director Josh Trank has created a strange, bitter-flavoured account of the celebrated mafioso in terminal decline in FloridaJosh Trank is the film-maker who took flight in 2012 with his brilliant superhero-nerd fantasy Chronicle, but then found the wind beneath his wings vanish with his disappointing Fantastic Four movie just three years later, which crashed acrimoniously to earth. Now he is back with this gloomy, distinctively grandiose but very confident study of a gangster legend in terminal decline in the Florida sun, basking in his own cantankerous scorn like one of the gators in the lake he overlooks. Trank has written, directed and edited it.Tom Hardy stars as Al Capone, referred to by his family as “Fonzo” (from his first name Alphonse). It is 1947, and he has just been released from prison after ten years, due to ill health having suffered a stroke. He is allowed to live under house arrest, bugged from afar by FBI men, and surrounded by watchful, slightly resentful family members – although his wife Mae (Linda Cardellini) seems genuinely still to care for him. He is only in his late 40s, but seems at least 20 years older than that. The film s one year, bounded by two Thanksgiving dinners, in the course of which Capone’s own physical and mental state declines, along with his finances. His estate is progressively denuded of its furniture, expensive artworks and statues, which happens in chilling parallel with Capone’s mental befuddlement.Capone’s eyes are as red as a vampire’s, and his voice is a growling croak, rasping out insults in English and Italian. He soils himself, which means that he staggers around his estate in dressing gown and adult nappies, like a huge and malevolent baby. And as the long slide into dementia steepens, he is visited by ghosts from the past, including an old enemy called Johnny (Matt Dillon) and gets phone calls from real people his actual family don’t know anything about. An oleaginous doctor called Karlock (Kyle MacLachlan) makes house calls, but he is secretly working for the feds, who want to know what all his glowering family and consiglieri want to know: has Capone hidden a large amount of money and just forgotten where it is?Trank wrongfoots those who suspect that he is going to intersperse this action with regular flashbacks showing Capone in his prime – and in fact I can imagine this film being reshot and re-edited in exactly this way, although that would rob it of its strange, bitter flavour. He has Capone’s memories and hallucinations bubble up through his raddled consciousness. It’s an interesting tableau of sadness, with a hint of Paolo Sorrentino in the way the camera drifts through Capone’s sunlit gardens with all their bizarre statues, including one under dust sheets making it look like a huge, covered penis. Maybe there’s a little of Scorsese’s Shutter Island, too, in that claustrophobic hint of madness and delusion in the air, and a touch of Brando’s Corleone in Capone’s sentimental clowning around with the grandkids at the first Thanksgiving party — an exertion of which he is sadly incapable in the second.Hardy is an entertainingly feral and angry Capone, although there is something a bit unsubtle in his eye-widening display of mute outrage when something displeases him. His most extended dialogue comes at the very beginning of the film, when he has to make a speech at the Thanksgiving dinner, and the film cleverly suggests that this sustained effort has really taken it out of the man, and sets him the downward road to physical ruin.It’s an interesting film, which Trank tops off with a contrived finale of bizarre, spectacular (and contrived) violence, yet the woozy slipping-into-dementia-fantasy sequences, although striking, mean sometimes that the visual impact of what we are seeing is sometimes lessened, as we wait to see if it is really happening or not. It’s a little unfinished and anticlimactic, but atmospheric. Hardy has a wonderful scene when Capone insists on singing along to the Cowardly Lion’s If I Were King of the Forest from The Wizard of Oz. Capone himself is a lonely, mangy lion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567a8f9ae12cff5a0b500be722a1043ce5e48367/0_793_8031_4819/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a116d77924b9182c02ec798ea07d5b09","title":"cheese and cheerful rachel roddy thrifty pasta bake recipe","story":"A hearty, heartwarming cheesy pasta bake that makes good use of store cupboard odds and ends“A mess”, “disorder”, “confusion”, “unclear” are some of the words that come up when you look to translate the word pasticcio. It is used to describe a 17th-century theatrical piece by multiple authors and composers, a sticky situation that is causing you grief, and a baked dish made up of various things.Writing this on 49th day of Roman quarantine, all these definitions feel applicable, one that is fitting for our lunch and for these thrifty times. My Sicilian partner, Vincenzo, grew up eating pasticci di pasta made by his grandmother in a town called Gela, in the kitchen we now use every summer. He reminds me that, two summers ago, when his late grandmother’s cooker was starting to give up, he sat holding a beer in one hand and, with the other, held down the cooker knob for 20 minutes so we could bake our disorder of rigatoni, tomato sauce, ricotta, aubergine and breadcrumbs.Vincenzo is also the one who did the costings on this recipe. He sat working out what it costs to make a pasticcio di pasta peas and bechamel for four. While it is both a necessity and my job to be alert to the cost of food, I feel ashamed to write that I’ve never been so detailed. It is sobering to see the cost of things – not in a vague, more-or-less-I-know-that way, but exactingly – the cost of 50g of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil, one spring onion, a grating of nutmeg, and two-tenths of a packet of peas: precisely how much a meal for four costs (in this case it’s €4.09, so £3.56) – how fortunate we are.It is a recipe of five parts: cooking the vegetables, making the bechamel, boiling the pasta, assembling, then baking. And there are three things to remember. The first is that you want the bechamel to be slightly more liquid than usual, because it going to finish cooking the pasta: not runny, but soft enough to coat and fall thickly from the back of a spoon.The second is that the pasta, ideally tubes – rigatoni, penne, macaroni – is going to baked again with bechamel and vegetables, so needs to be only par-boiled until al dente, which is not to mean chalky or crunchy, simply firm to the tooth. Set the timer for two minutes before the end of the recommended cooking time on the packet, so that by the time you have drained it, the consistency is hopefully just right.The third is – picking up the theme from last weeks’ soup – to remember to season at all stages tiny pinches that accumulate and result in a well-seasoned final dish.Actually, there’s a fourth thing, too, and that is to take all the above instructions, quantities and things only as loose suggestions after all, this is meant to be a good-hearted mess. Use what you have in terms of vegetables, pasta and cheese – especially cheese: this is a perfect place for all those odds and ends – and a tin of tuna might also be nice. Whatever you add, bake it until the top is golden and the edges of the tubes sticking out are toasted and the edges bubbling. Enjoy your disorder.Olive oil2 spring onions, diced2 courgettes, diced200g peas400g pasta tubes (such as rigatoni, penne, macaroni)For the bechamel 50g butter50g plain flour600ml whole milk, warmSalt and pepper50g parmesan or grana padanoNutmegIn a frying pan, cook the onion in some olive oil with a pinch of salt until it is starting to go soft and translucent, add the courgettes and peas, stir, then add a little water, and cook until the vegetables are soft, with just a little oily liquid. Put to one side.Make the bechamel. Melt the butter in a heavy pan, stir in the flour and cook, stirring, to get a digestive biscuit-coloured roux. Pull the pan from the heat and whisk in the warm milk, and some salt and pepper to taste. Return to the stove, and cook over a low heat, whisking, until the sauce comes to a simmering boil.Continue cooking for another 10 minutes, always stirring, until the sauce has the consistency of double cream. Add half the parmesan, stir, check the seasoning and add nutmeg to taste.Cook the pasta as usual in well-salted water, but set the timer two minutes before the end of the recommended cooking time: you want to the pasta to be cooked though, but al dente, because it is going to bake again.In a large bowl, mix the three elements – vegetables, bechamel and pasta – turn the mixture into a suitable baking dish, top with the remaining cheese and bake at 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 for 20 minutes, or until the tip is golden and edges are bubbling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11a22329070182a6b4eb9ce14a33e54eda8e6810/0_151_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1314c1b6c3e523a258e1d2a8ed024a","title":"magical meal plans how one easy dish makes three distinctive dinners from roast chicken to fish pie","story":"Tired of cooking? Here’s how to make one meal go a deliciously long way, whether you’re getting creative with banana bread or turning a soup into a stewFor many, there is no lazing around in lockdown. We want to eat well, but lack the time to cook every meal from scratch. One solution? Modular meal-planning: deliberately cooking too much of a dish in such a way that the initial effort feeds seamlessly into two more. We asked a variety of chefs for their best three-part meal strategies.Mary-Ellen McTague, the chef-owner at Manchester’s Creameries and currently the coordinator of a community food project, often makes multiple family meals using kilos of beef mince. For a really tasty basic mince, she says: “Caramelise onions with star anise, separately sweat down carrots and celery, and brown your mince. Combine everything with chopped tomatoes and stock simmer gently for two hours. Towards the end, add dry or fresh herbs, such as thyme and rosemary.”Use immediately in cottage pie, spiking the mince with tomato or brown sauce. The day after, give it an Italian spin to make bolognese or lasagne (sweat garlic in oil, add and reduce red wine, stir through the mince and reheat). On day three, go kind of Mexican. Roast cumin, dried coriander and chillies in the oven (five minutes at 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6), grind them and as it heats, let that infuse in the mince. Serve on tacos with the usual garnishes. Not that you must eat mince three days running. McTague says: “Generally, to stop everyone getting bored, if I’m batch-cooking, I use some for a couple of days and freeze the rest.”Reheating rice unnerves home cooks, but Si Toft, the chef-owner at the Dining Room in Abersoch, says: “If you cool rice quickly, there’s no reason you can’t reheat it.” Cook excess mushroom risotto and chill it spread on a baking tray in the fridge. Next day, make arancini with it: “Make a ball, push your thumb in to make a pocket for the mozzarella and squeeze it shut. Breadcrumb and shallow-fry.” Check the arancini are piping hot using a skewer. On day three, try risotto cake by stirring combined egg and ricotta through the leftovers. Bake in a lined cake tin until hot (15-20 minutes). Serve with salad: “The top gets crunchy like pilaf or you can chuck tomatoes or creamed leeks on, which bleed in as it bakes. It’s a staff tea that ended up on the menu – a banger!”What do you do with this lockdown hit once you can’t stomach any more? Sven-Hanson Britt, the chef at Oxeye in London, likes it as french toast spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar, “with a fried egg on top if you want to be filthy”. Or as a boozy trifle base: “If you spiced your banana bread, go for rum if you want a coffee-tiramisu vibe, do the classic Tia Maria-Kahlua collab.”“Folk may start with stew, then make a soup I do it the other way,” says Elaine Mason, the owner of Edinburgh’s currently delivery-only Union of Genius. First, make a slow-simmered tomato soup punched up with harissa and Worcestershire sauce and finished with fried chorizo. “Day two, add boiled chunks of potato, butter beans and crumbled black pudding to make a rich, hearty stew. Day three, add tomato puree and smoked paprika or chipotle chillies – dry or in adobo sauce – and serve over rice.”“Couscous brings a dish together, but cannot command the stage,” says Alex Claridge, the chef-owner at the Wilderness in Birmingham. Make a salad and “dress it like Gok Wan in his heyday”, with citrus, a “hedgerow of fresh herbs” and “sexier ingredients” from pomegranate to roast almonds. That mix will develop flavour overnight, after which Claridge creates fritters from it. Crack an egg and a little binding flour into the grains, add cubed feta or halloumi, press into rings, fry both sides, then bake in the oven for six minutes at 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Serve with salad. If you season and set some aside initially, couscous is also a useful next-day crumb for salmon.Afterwards, strip the carcass, retaining the meat for a stir-fry. “I eat rice noodles, but any will do,” says Grainger who suggests starting with ginger, chilli, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns. White wine or even chicken stock can stand in midway for rice wine, he says, and freestyle the late addition of soy, fish sauce or mirin: “Use whatever you’ve got.”On day three, make soup. Use the carcass to make an eight-hour simmered chicken stock flavoured with onions, carrot, celery, thyme and garlic. That may sound daunting, but the stock should manage itself. Just leave it bubbling away. When the stock is ready, remove the vegetables, but retain them – mashed with soy, fish sauce, chilli flakes and a little cornflour, you can use them to fill supermarket dumpling skins: “A nice little treat.” Then, to make the soup, soften diced carrot, celery, onion and potatoes in butter, add a splash of wine and lemon juice, let that reduce, add the stock and simmer. Bulk the soup out with rice or pearl barley.Dressed with tahini, honey-roasted carrots and chickpeas make a cracking warm feta salad. Cut finger-sized carrot batons. “Any thinner and they’ll burn,” says Jo Pratt, the author of The Flexible Family Cookbook (due out from Quarto in September) – toss them in olive oil, ground cumin, cayenne pepper and salt and, at around 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6, roast them until they colour and soften. Add a little honey (a tablespoon for each kilo of carrots) and some chickpeas, and cook for another 10 minutes, then break in the feta, mix and serve. Any leftover veggies can enjoy a further life as carrot hummus, the basis of a pasta sauce or chopped into a frittata. Tip: soak the vegetables in the beaten eggs for 10 minutes so the two meld together, “rather than it feeling as if the vegetables and frittata are two separate components”.Leftovers from a vegetable curry can be jazzed up the next day in a biryani, says Mayur Patel, co-owner of Bundobust. “This is going back to Mum’s recipes, a quick biryani,” says Patel, but it is still an undertaking. First, you need to embolden the flavour of last night’s curry. Cook salt and garam masala in oil, add the vegetable curry and, ideally, rose-water, kewra water, fresh chillies, coriander and lemon juice – “that’s key” – before baking it layered with rice, blackened onions, boiled eggs and yoghurt: “It curdles, so you get this almost curd-cheese through the rice.” Cool any remaining biryani in the fridge and, the following day, fry off patties in butter. Serve with Patel’s zingy chutney: “Blend an entire stalk of coriander, fresh green chillies, garlic cloves and lemon juice, like a salsa verde. Spooned over the patties, that’s wicked.”Club Mexicana owner Meriel Armitage, who is now helping to feed London’s frontline NHS staff, swears by the versatility of a veg-packed black-bean chilli, flavoured with bay, garlic, chilli powder, oregano and smoked paprika: “You can add anything you particularly like – a kick of cumin can be nice.” Freeze or use it within three days as you would mince in a sweet potato cottage pie or lasagne, as topping for a jacket spud or on loaded nachos.Matt Bishop, chef at the London restaurant Roast in Borough Market, favours “a creamy flavourful fish base” – fish pie filling minus the eggs or peas, essentially. “Cleverly masked, this can make several different meals.” As well as in fish pie itself, use the mix with spring onion and potato to make fish cakes (200g of fish mix to 300g of dry mash) or a coconut fish curry. Sauté onion, chillies, two garlic cloves and a teaspoon of coriander seeds until soft, add and boil off 75ml of cider vinegar, add a half-tin of chopped tomatoes, and bring to the boil. Add half a tin of coconut milk, 400g of the fish mix, 100g of cubed potato and loads of coriander. Bring to a gentle boil, season and serve with basmati."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31fc981d9aa2fa9d1c4bfdc6ecd7ddc8f363aecc/0_0_3070_1843/master/3070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc3a37d83040eebf8296a20febdfda78","title":"new legal documents raise fresh questions over newcastle takeover deal saudi arabia premier league","story":"New legal documents have been passed to the Premier League during the past 24 hours that raise fresh questions about whether the controversial £300m Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of Newcastle United should get the go-ahead, the  can reveal.Premier League lawyers are understood to be reviewing information which is said to establish a firm link between the Saudi government and a homegrown pirate TV and streaming service which offers illegal access to sporting events – including English football, Wimbledon and the Six Nations – on the BeoutQ platform.The new evidence means that any decision to approve the Newcastle takeover by a consortium involving Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund, Reuben Brothers and Amanda Staveley – which had been expected within days – is expected to be pushed back.The Premier League will scrutinise the information to see whether it further calls into question whether the consortium passes its owners’ and directors’ test, which states that digital piracy is prohibited.Newcastle’s prospective Saudi majority owners have denied any link to the BeoutQ piracy. The Premier League’s test says applicants must not provide “false, misleading or inaccurate information”.Saudi Arabia has previously claimed BeoutQ originated in Cuba and Colombia. However in January the Gulf state was named in a European Commission report for its failure to crack down on the platform.Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and La Liga are among the sporting bodies that have attempted to take legal action to shut down the platform in Saudi Arabia, but nine local legal firms have declined to take on the copyright case.Meanwhile Saudi Arabia remains on a US government “Priority Watch List” as one of the “notorious markets for counterfeiting and piracy”.Recently BeIN’s chief executive, Yousef al-Obaidly, wrote to the Premier League and its clubs warning of the “danger of allowing the acquisition” given what he identified as Saudi Arabia’s direct role in BeoutQ’s “illegal actions and their direct impact upon the commercial interests of the Premier League”.The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, urged the Premier League to consider the “damage” that BeoutQ’s pirating of broadcasts had caused the sport before deciding on the Newcastle takeover.Amnesty International has also asked the league to consider blocking the takeover because the fund is overseen by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, saying he has been involved in a “sweeping crackdown on human rights”.The Premier League refused to comment when contacted by the .

But after the fifth shareholders’ meeting since play was suspended in March plans still remain incomplete and, for the first time, the possibility of curtailing the season was discussed openly by clubs.On Monday the government revealed its plans for easing the coronavirus lockdown. They included the possible resumption of “cultural and sporting events” which could “take place behind closed-doors for broadcast, while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact”. This would not be before 1 June and would be dependent on meeting the government’s five tests for reducing the spread of the virus.The Premier League learned of the plans just as their shareholders’ meeting was coming to a close. The issue of playing matches at neutral venues and preventing crowds gathering at grounds was the greatest sticking point. Clubs in the bottom six were against neutral venues, claiming the absence of home advantage would distort the competition and other clubs, Newcastle being one, were against it too. At the meeting, it was decided the idea could be revisited.“I think everybody would prefer to play home and away if at all possible,” Masters said. “And I think it’s clear to see that some clubs feel more strongly about that than others. We’ve been talking to the authorities about the conditions in which we could get the Premier League back up and running and taking all that advice on board. But it is an ongoing dialogue.“I think some of our clubs would argue that, in relation to policing their own fans, they have a good relationship with them and they’re in a better position to control that. But this has to be a decision that’s come to mutually.”Clubs are expected to have local discussions about the possibility of putting on games at their own grounds. It is one of a number of pieces of continuing work the most important remains agreeing medical protocols for, in the first instance, the safe return of training. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200511-54566-gnl.fw.200511.jf.Istanbul.mp3 Asked if it were possible that players could veto plans agreed by clubs, Masters said: “We are not anticipating it and obviously, what we are trying to do is create the safest possible environment for a return to training for players, for managers, for their coaches and the other staff that need to be involved. We think we are going to be able to create that safe environment.”Masters admitted, however, that the possibility of the season not being completed had been discussed by clubs and that the path towards any matches remained difficult. “It was discussed for the first time but the contents of that discussion have to remain confidential. What I can say is that all of the talk was about finishing the season. No conclusions were reached on any other models. Those are future conversations we may need to have.”The prospective restart of matches has long been pegged to early June in discussions, but when asked if he thought these dates were still on course to be met, Masters demurred. “I really wouldn’t want to make a prediction now,” he said. “There are many steps to be taken, many hurdles to get over before we get to that point. It’s too early for us to talk about it. “We want to remain in step with government and the authorities, and we want to remain in step with the mood of football supporters. I think really the talk at the moment should be about the tentative steps we are taking now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45028513024e3255a8ff7876a78f9cd10ada592/0_0_4980_2990/master/4980.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cb28a25406f1a2b6d8d687ba97156d40","title":"classical concerts to watch at home our critics picks week eight","story":"Our critics pick a daily highlight from the treasure trove of online music. This week we bring you lushness from Renée Fleming and a torrid thriller from KorngoldBrowse our picks from:This Opera Ballet Vlaanderen extravanganza is Bruegel gone psychedelic. Staged at the opera house in Ghent, where the original 16th-century story is set, its citizens oppressed under Spanish occupation, Franz Schreker’s 1932 “magic opera” tells of Smee the Blacksmith’s (“Der Schmied”) Faustian pact. He negotiates untold wealth not with the devil but his mistress, Astarte, she of the diabolic eyes Satan himself towers monstrously over proceedings, his palace a riff on Ghent’s medieval Gravensteen castle. So far so local, but Ersan Mondtag, in his opera directing debut, boldly draws a parallel with Belgium’s later colonial history, suggesting that, in time, the oppressed become the oppressors. The music stops altogether for Patrice Lumumba’s speech proclaiming Congolese independence, and Smee – sung by the brilliant Leigh Melrose – ends up as King Leopold II, desperate to get into heaven. Schreker’s score is eclectic, his own libretto often comic. Mondtag makes it zany and outrageous, but his indictment of empire-building and its atrocities is searing. It inevitably invokes, too, the Nazi era, which spelled the end of Schreker’s hitherto illustrious career. (Available until 6 November) Rian EvansStaged last February to mark the Liège opera house’s bicentenary, this fine Don Carlos takes Verdi’s original 1866 French score as its starting point (albeit minus the Act III ballet), giving us a rare opportunity to hear the work roughly as Verdi first imagined it (cuts were imposed for the Paris premiere and revisions subsequently undertaken). Stefano Mazzonis de Pralafera’s production is fairly straightforward, the only quirk being the omnipresence of the mysterious Monk (Patrick Bolleire), as a silent observer of the tragedy unfolding round him. Paolo Arrivabeni’s conducting sometimes lacks urgency, but playing and singing are both excellent, Gregory Kunde and Yolanda Auyanet are particularly impressive as Carlos and Élisabeth. The outstanding performances, though, come from Ildebrando D’Arcangelo’s tragic Philippe II, Lionel Lhote’s humane, reflective Rodrigue and Kate Aldrich’s powerhouse Eboli. Tim AshleyThe NY Phil Plays On portal is a rapidly expanding treasure trove of the venerable orchestra’s recorded appearances both recent and “historical”. Among the newest additions is a glorious 1997 performance under Kurt Masur of Mozart’s Exsultate, jubilate K165 and three Strauss orchestral songs with soprano Renée Fleming. In the best possible way, this is music-making from “another lifetime” (as Fleming describes it in her specially recorded introduction). She’s at her vocal peak and in her ideal repertory: hold-your-breath lushness and gleaming ornamentation in Mozart crushed-velvet low notes and unbeatable storytelling (with all the late-Romantic peaks and troughs you could want from the orchestra) in Strauss. The audience goes wild at the end – and no wonder. Flora WillsonA vicarious escape from the confines of lockdown into the joyously uncluttered landscapes of Finland is provided by Santtu-Mathias Rouvali’s performances of two of Sibelius’s earliest tone poems. Rouvali, who next year becomes principal conductor of the Philharmonia in London, and has been the Gothenburg Symphony’s chief since 2017, pairs the well-known En Saga with The Wood Nymph, based upon a poem by Viktor Rydberg, which was composed three years later, in 1895. Perhaps because it lacked the conciseness of En Saga, The Wood Nymph received only a handful of performances over the next century, until it was rehabilitated and recorded by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony in 1996. Rouvali’s parents were members of that Lahti orchestra: the young conductor must have grown up listening to Vänskä’s crisp, no-nonsense Sibelius interpretations. Something certainly seems to have rubbed off – Rouvali’s approach to these works is equally unfussy, with nothing added unnecessarily, and textures that are clean and hard-edged the playing of the GSO, too, is totally secure. Andrew ClementsThe 17-year-old Korngold’s torrid thriller gets plush treatment in Pier Luigi Pizzi’s Turin staging, filmed in January this year, which dispenses with the original Renaissance setting and reimagines the opera as a chic if lethal game of sex and death played out among the 1920s smart set. Indebted to Strauss and early Schoenberg, the score, handsomely conducted by Pinchas Steinberg, is gorgeous to the point of excess. Ultimately, though, this is a big dramatic soprano vehicle, and Annemarie Kremer is splendid as the eponymous heroine, determined to wreak vengeance on her sister’s seducer Alfonso (Norman Reinhardt, suitably glamorous) only to find herself increasingly attracted to him. Michael Kupfer-Radecky, meanwhile, plays her uptight husband, Simone, who, we soon realise, has murder on his mind. It’s way over the top, all of it, but utterly compulsive.

And still we can’t get enough of itThere are No 1 pop songs you hear everywhere you go and soon hope never to hear again and then there are pop songs that, to quote the critic Robert Christgau, “actually reveal themselves to you in that kind of saturation”. Nearly 20 years ago, he gave the examples of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want It That Way and Cher’s Believe – songwriting so irresistible, it withstands not only play after play but years of changing tastes and production.Call Me Maybe is another song you are still glad to be reminded of, even after hearing it a gazillion times. As Justin Bieber tweeted to his many millions of Twitter followers, after hearing it on Canadian radio in late 2011: it is “possibly the catchiest song I’ve ever heard lol”. His endorsement prompted his manager, Scooter Braun, to sign the artist, one Carly Rae Jepsen – then best known as the third-place runner-up on 2007’s Canadian Idol.Bieber had “never jumped out and promoted an artist like this before,” Braun told Rolling Stone. Months later, in April 2012, Bieber still hadn’t got Call Me Maybe out of his head. A video of him larking about and miming the lyrics with then-girlfriend Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale and a host of other tweenage celebrities went viral. Their enthusiasm was as infectious as the song, inspiring everyone from Katy Perry to US armed forces in Afghanistan to follow suit.You could not have planned Call Me Maybe’s path to No 1 better had you tried. Within weeks it had hit the top spot in 16 countries with more than 10m copies sold and 355m views on YouTube. It was the kind of rocket-fuelled, felicitous ascent that today might suggest an industry plant – but social media’s instant embrace of Call Me Maybe was organic and real, a human response to something so moreish.On first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can’t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater.Its power lies in its compulsive karaoke quality: you can’t sing along to the chorus without also twirling your finger at your temple and miming a phone. And at three minutes and 13 seconds, it leaves you wanting more, and more – until you eventually succumb to the repeat button.But most of Call Me Maybe’s charm has to do with its singer. At 26, Jepsen was older than most pop stars are at the time of their breakout hit, and certainly past the point of thinking an exchange of phone numbers “crazy” – but she buys into the bubblegum romance with such enthusiasm and warmth, and what could be corny is purely endearing.It speaks to persistent snobbishness about mainstream pop that Call Me Maybe is often spoken of today as a novelty record or guilty pleasure, rather than as an enduring classic. But it’s precisely the song’s candy-floss lightness that has sustained its longevity. Even when Jepsen achieved indie cred with her 2015 album Emotion, it wasn’t with the sense of “now this is the music I’ve always wanted to make”. Now 34, she continues to perform Call Me Maybe with the same infectious delight as she gave it a decade ago. And why wouldn’t she? It’s still every bit as good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

The first changes in “step one” of the process will be introduced on WednesdayWorkAnyone who cannot work from home should now consider travelling to work if their workplace is open. Employers have a duty to ensure the workplace is safe, and the government says it has given people guidance on how to run a safe working environment.Workers are asked to cycle or walk to work as much as possible or travel by car, to reduce use of public transport, and to avoid peak times. Employers are being asked to consider finding more car parking and bike spaces and to provide changing rooms so staff can change clothes for work.Workers coming into contact with others during their shifts should consider washing their clothes more often. The virus can stay on surfaces for up to 72 hours, so there should be regular disinfecting where possible. Bosses are also being asked to consider allowing staggered start times. Workplaces should be well ventilated.SchoolsIt is too early to open schools in step one, although the government is asking local councils to encourage vulnerable pupils and the children of critical workers to go to school. The government is amending its guidance to clarify that paid childcare, for example by nannies and childminders, can take place as long as they adhere to the government’s guidelines on staying safe inside the home, which includes regular handwashing, washing clothes, keeping a place well ventilated and considering more activities outside.TravelEverybody should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible. The government says it will increase funding and give new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, consider road closures in cities and create pop-up cycle lanes.ExerciseUnlimited outdoor exercise means you can go out as many times in a day as you like, but you will still not be able to use areas such as playgrounds or outdoor gyms, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. You can exercise with up to one person from outside your household, which means no team sports unless every participant is from the same household.Social contactAs long as you adhere to the two-metre physical distancing rules, you can meet up with one person from outside your household, like a friend or relative, in a public place.OutdoorsYou can drive to an outdoor place no matter how far from your household, as long as you adhere to physical distancing. However, the rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which means people from England should not travel to parts of the country that are not adhering to Boris Johnson’s “step one” plan.Face coveringsThese are not mandatory, but if you can then you should wear one on public transport and in some shops. They should not be worn by children under two years old.ShieldingThis should continue for extremely vulnerable groups, who should stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. For example, those who have had an organ transplant or are receiving chemotherapy or renal dialysis.People aged over 70, those with specific, chronic, pre-existing conditions, and pregnant women, are “clinically vulnerable” and should minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded. The document said it is likely that the government will advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to shield beyond June – the end of the current 12-week period.These measures are for England and are reliant on the risk level at the time of making a final decision. The first day of June is the goal for the following measures, but this is flexible. There would be 48 hours’ notice of any changes.SchoolsA phased return for early years settings and schools. Schools should prepare to open for more children from 1 June, with early years, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return in smaller classes. Secondary schools could begin some face-to-face contact for years 10 and 12 pupils, who have key exams next year. All children could return to school before the summer for a month, depending on scientific advice.ShopsNon-essential shops could reopen from 1 June on a phased basis. Pubs, cafes and restaurants, and beauty services would not be allowed to reopen at this point because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher.Sport and cultureCultural and sporting events will be allowed to take place behind closed doors for broadcast.Social and family contactThe government says it wants to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission. One measure could be allowing two households to share childcare to create a “social bubble”. The government is considering looking at allowing small weddings.These measures will be considered for introduction on 4 July. If all the five tests are met and there is scientific advice that suggests further changes are acceptable, the government plans to reopen remaining businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, beauty salons, places of worship and cinemas.These places must meet safety guidelines. Some venues which by their design make physical distancing difficult may not be able to reopen at this stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaad890f6f4fc42c3cc58d30651a2c034ce7d957/0_124_4733_2841/master/4733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd89bbd0de8194c211a508d00668f30a","title":"humans and neanderthals co existed in europe far longer than thought","story":"Cave objects suggest modern humans and Neanderthals shared continent for several thousand yearsModern humans were present in Europe at least 46,000 years ago, according to new research on objects found in Bulgaria, meaning they overlapped with Neanderthals for far longer than previously thought.Researchers say remains and tools found at a cave called Bacho Kiro reveal that modern humans and Neanderthals were present at the same time in Europe for several thousand years, giving them ample time for biological and cultural interaction.“Our work in Bacho Kiro shows there is a time overlap of maybe 8,000 years between the arrival of the first wave of modern humans in eastern Europe and the final extinction of Neanderthals in the far west of Europe,” said Prof Jean-Jacques Hublin, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, a co-author of the research, adding that that was far longer than previously thought. Some scholars have suggested a period of not more than 3,000 years.Neanderthals were roaming Europe until about 40,000 years ago. “It gives a lot of time for these groups to interact biologically and also culturally and behaviourally,” Hublin added. Writing in studies published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology \u0026amp Evolution, Hublin and colleagues report how they excavated Bacho Kiro, a site that has been studied several times over the past decades. Previous excavations revealed human remains and tools of a very specific type known as “initial upper palaeolithic”. Hublin said such stone and bone tools showed features both of tools known to have been used by Neanderthals and toolkits used by later modern humans, with much debate over which hominin was making them.However, previous dating of the site ran into a number of difficulties, including from contamination. Now Hublin and colleagues have carried out new excavations and unearthed more tools and remains, including bone fragments and a tooth revealed by methods including ancient DNA analysis to be from early modern humans.The team report that radiocarbon dating of modern human remains found in the same layer as the tools suggested the remains dated to between 46,790 and 42,810 years ago, while a dating technique based on the rate of changes in DNA from mitochondria, the “powerhouses” of cells, suggested a date of between 44,830 and 42,616 years ago.The team say the same sort of tools were found in the layer beneath, alongside animal remains dating to almost 47,000 years ago. “We are talking about the oldest modern humans in Europe,” said Hublin, adding that their archaeological context was “crystal clear”. In other words, this group was making initial upper palaeolithic tools .Among further discoveries, the researchers found jewellery fashioned from cave bear teeth that they say is strikingly similar to that produced by the very last Neanderthals. They say this adds weight to the idea the latter may have adopted innovations as a result of contact with early modern humans.“Some people would say that is a coincidence I don’t believe it,” said Hublin, noting there was already genetic evidence that the groups interbred. “I don’t see how you can have biological interaction between groups without any sign of behavioural influence of one on the other.”Prof Chris Stringer, an expert in human origins from London’s Natural History Museum, said while his team had previously discovered what was possibly an incomplete modern human skull in Greece from more than 200,000 years ago, the new research was important.“In my view this is the oldest and strongest published evidence for a very early upper palaeolithic presence of Homo sapiens in Europe, several millennia before the Neanderthals disappeared,” he said.He added that doubt remained about whether Neanderthals were influenced in their jewellery making by early modern humans. Stringer said the new study highlighted several mysteries, including why the appearance of such early modern humans in Europe 46,000 years ago did not lead to their earlier establishment and an earlier disappearance of Neanderthals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70f3cdd71d2c7f4e119ae49627b1803e2477c1a/219_151_3751_2252/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8620f20487e3e294ce333f506b509d87","title":"england players expected to complete cricket based work in pairs","story":"England’s cricketers are poised to make a return to training, either in pairs or with a designated coach, amid growing optimism that international matches can be staged behind closed doors this summer.The government’s Covid-19 recovery strategy permits exercise “with up to one person from outside your household” from Wednesday and now the England and Wales Cricket Board is seeking to establish what this means for all levels of the sport during talks with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport this week.The hope for the centrally-contracted men is that, with sporting events deemed to have a chance to resume in empty stadia from 1 June under step two of the strategy, and the ECB lining up six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan from 8 July, they can begin having one-on-one net sessions outdoors, provided a two-metre distance is still observed by the participants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d66e8d1cdcd222e2491ddf2c6678afe998870a/162_184_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0dc2725b5715d4143cff101e13b9ee4","title":"new shape of sport begins to emerge team games and elite level set to lose out","story":"Monday’s announcements from the government offer a little clarity but while some sports can see green shoots of recovery, for others there are few reasons for optimismFinally, after weeks of claustrophobia and a weekend of confusion, some clarity. From Wednesday, tennis players and golfers in England will be able to lubricate rusty swings and overly tight hips again. Basketball players will be able to dunk and shoot from downtown. And all outdoor sports facilities will be allowed to open, with the sole exception of open-air swimming pools.People will even be able to exercise with someone outside their households – a sweet blessing for personal trainers, coaches, and those driven up fingerprint-stained walls by their families. The only catch? Social distancing guidelines will still have to be rigorously followed. So no doubles matches or fourballs, yet.However, sharing sports equipment – such as tennis rackets and balls – is now permitted according to Sport England providing people “enforce strong hygiene measures”, such as using antibacterial spray and washing hands thoroughly before and afterwards.Organisations such as the tennis’s LTA and golf’s R\u0026ampA are now busily creating commonsense guidance for clubs, which they intend to publish in the next 24 hours. They can see welcome green shoots on the horizon. But for other sports a much less certain future awaits.Indeed, what became clear on Monday is a two-tier system for sport will be in place in England for the foreseeable future: inidual v team, indoor v outdoor, and perhaps even amateur v elite.The picture is certainly far less rosy for gyms and indoor sports centres, many of whom are glaring at their balance sheets the way the rest of us might look at a 400kg set of weights. With no members’ subscriptions coming in and landlords demanding they keep paying rent, there are few reasons for optimism.The government’s advice also makes clear that team sports are still banned, except with members of your own household, which means five-a-side fees for sports centres will be off the agenda for a while yet.Meanwhile local sports clubs are also worried about what the future holds – despite the efforts of Sport England, which has added £15m to its lottery-funded community emergency fund, bringing the total for grassroots sports since the lockdown to £35m. However Sport England admits it will take a while to fully understand the nature and scale of the impact on clubs up and down the country.And what of elite sport? Here the picture remains muddled despite the announcement on Monday that events can now take place for broadcast behind closed doors after 1 June. However, officials insist that this is an aspiration not a goal. There are still hurdles to jump, hoops to clear, uncertain pitfalls ahead.That much was made clear when the Premier League’s 20 clubs met to discuss Project Restart again on Monday. It was telling that when Richard Masters, the chief executive, was asked whether momentum was building for a 12 June return he did not exactly issue a clarion call. Instead he soberly pointed out he did not want to make a prediction and that it was too early to say.Masters also revealed for the first time that contingency planning was in place in case the season could not finish as planned by July. “Those are future conversations we may need to have,” he admitted.There was also, Masters admitted, no protocol yet for contact in training. There should, at least, be some clarity on that issue within the next 36 hours given the Department for Digital, Culture and Media and Sport is set to release a set of protocols drawn up by Sally Munday, the chief executive of UK Sport, in conjunction with senior figures from across sport.Even so, it seems a stretch to be going from where we are now to the blood and thunder of a Premier League fixture within a month.Importantly there seems no cross-party consensus that football should return quickly either – as the shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, made clear in a 20-question letter to the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston. “Football is at its best when it allows people from all walks of life to lose themselves in the beauty and excitement of the beautiful game,” she wrote. “Taking chances with the public health won’t bring that back. It will only delay its return.”As for when we will get to watch matches in stadiums again, the government is also downbeat. As a 60-page report published on Monday made clear: “It is likely that reopening venues that attract large crowds (like sports stadia) ... may only be fully possible significantly later depending on the reduction in numbers of infections.”What “significantly later” precisely means is not spelt out. But it does not have to be. Even with the death toll dropping and the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic hopefully behind us, the thought of 80,000 people filling Wembley again without a vaccine appears a dangerous fantasy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b959abddfff1eac043c278706e47b949478475e/0_80_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e813928bbb2e4eafbb4ee777b89cf99","title":"tesla factory reopening elon musk california lockdown","story":"CEO announces electric carmaker will begin production on Monday after company sues county over Covid-19 restrictionsElon Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would resume production at its northern California factory on Monday afternoon, in defiance of a local public health order designed to slow the spread of coronavirus.“Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules,” the billionaire CEO tweeted. “I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.”Musk’s announcement followed a weekend of escalating threats by the entrepreneur against the county that is home to Tesla’s only car factory in the US. On Saturday, Tesla sued Alameda county, alleging that the local public health order violated California’s constitution.The Tesla plant has been closed since 23 March. The factory employs about 10,000 workers. On Monday, the plant’s parking lot was nearly full, prompting speculation that the company planned to defy the public health order even before Musk’s tweet.“We’re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,” an email to Tesla employees stated, according to Reuters.State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.On Monday, the county health department referred to a statement it made on Saturday saying it was working with Tesla to develop a safety plan allowing the Fremont plant to reopen.The department said it looked forward to agreeing on a plan to reopen “very soon”, but it noted that “it is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions” in the safest way possible.Tesla says it has safety procedures to protect workers including increased cleaning, enforcement of social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves where needed, installing barriers between workers when necessary and worker temperature checks at some locations.On Monday, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said during his daily press briefing that he was not aware Tesla had reopened but that he had “great expectations that we can work through at the county levels”, adding: “We look forward to many, many decades of that relationship with Tesla.”The coronavirus has killed nearly 80,000 people in the US. Alameda county had recorded 2,101 cases of Covid-19 and 71 deaths as of Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e9a811a74a67e0907386d3fff3c4aad4dd29b87/0_282_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17e64f8c148f4fe03fa3b5f46cd546d","title":"how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers","story":"A former deputy headteacher reveals how to ace the remote recruitment process during lockdown and hire a teacher perfect for your schoolAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f3403ecd0ae1dc35460cf7651c7f3a1e5ead90/0_580_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a3c4154f4baafb3c2740ebd92e1468e","title":"the big picture americas wild young women","story":"The myth of the American west meets the energy of riot grrrl in Justine Kurland’s photographs of free-spirited teenage girlsIn 1997, Justine Kurland, then a fine arts student at Yale University, went in search of teenage girls to photograph. At a time of increasing conformity and commercialised ideas of beauty, the girls she had in mind were free-spirited and wild-haired making dens and hanging out in woods, messing about in rivers, smoking in parking lots, lost in languid afternoons, careless not only of the male gaze but any onlookers at all.Kurland started out on her quest in New Haven’s semi-industrial hinterland before travelling further afield over the next five years on a mazy road trip if the girls were on the margins, then she would be too. She loosely choreographed the groups of teenagers that she found, but mostly invited the girls into a promising setting and let them do their thing. She took this photograph of four girls in an abandoned car in the millennium year, and called it Shipwrecked. The girls she chose invariably understood the idea of the pictures. “I can always spot people,” she has said. “It’s, like, really one of my superpowers. I can always tell which teenage girls would love living in the woods with their friends.”She sees her work – collected in a book, Girl Pictures – in the tradition of American landscape photography of the 19th century, which put young frontiersmen into natural settings as a way of propagandising the idea of the west, and a vision of liberty. Her utopian scenes recreated that idealised political fantasy, and recast it for 21st-century women: courageous and vivid and sisterly. In a monograph for an exhibition of the pictures, she wrote how she tried to channel the raw energy of riot grrrl bands of that time into her portraits. “All the power chords we would ever need lay within reach, latent, coiled in wait…”Girl Pictures by Justine Kurland, with previously unpublished photographs, is out later this month (Aperture, £40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36108a2bddb675a11651d7ae6f8658e5014cce86/0_292_5304_3182/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123daa96b68a8fa71b1016bab2b830ae","title":"barcelona without tourists coronavirus lockdown residents reclaim city inherit ghost town","story":"Last year Barcelona received 30 million visitors – now there are none. Emerging from Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdown, how do its tourist-weary residents feel about getting their city back?For six weeks, the streets of Barcelona were deserted. Not a soul except the Deliveroo and Glovo riders and the occasional shopper, masked and gloved, making a foray to the nearest supermarket before scurrying back home. In a city with one of the highest population densities in Europe, there was no one to be seen.Throughout this time, people here have shown an extraordinary and perhaps unexpected degree of discipline, stoicism and collective spirit in sticking to the rules of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns.It’s easing now, bit by bit. As of today, in most of Spain, bars with outdoor tables can open and people are allowed to visit each other’s homes. Some parks and beaches will open, too, but only for exercise. Sunbathing is not encouraged.Not, alas, in Madrid, or Barcelona, where the authorities say we’ll have to wait another week. It’s disappointing, of course, but at least we’re allowed out for a few hours a day, and nothing will ever erase the memory of that first taste of freedom, just over a week ago, when we were allowed out for exercise for the first time.After the wettest April in a century, it was a clear, sunny morning. There was birdsong. You really hear the birds now there are so few cars. You hear so much, and there’s no need to shout above the traffic. A city looks different when cars no longer dominate the landscape you see the line of the street, details in the architecture. And we probably haven’t breathed air as clean as this since before the industrial revolution.People were out in numbers, in ones and twos, walking, jogging and speaking softly. Spain has a reputation as the noisiest country in Europe, but that morning everyone spoke sotto voce, as though afraid to break the spell.There was something else too, something different that you couldn’t put your finger on at first. And then we realised: it was just us out there. People speaking Catalan and Spanish, as well as French and German and Urdu and all the many languages of this multicultural city, but they were all people who live here.There were no tourists. None. No cycle tours, no Segways, no rickshaws, no one selling selfie sticks, no one trying to lure you in to eat a paella at an hour when no one here eats paella – indeed, at an hour when no one eats, punto.It was just us. After decades in which tourism has grown exponentially, inexorably, to the point where the city’s 1.6 million inhabitants received 30 million visitors last year, they’d gone. All of them. We’d got our city back. Even La Rambla, long ago abandoned to the lurid forces of occupation, was ours once more.Yes, it feels like liberation, but it doesn’t feel right. The bars and restaurants are shut, and many will never reopen. Nor will many other businesses for which tourism is their raison d’être.“I passed by the Sagrada Familia and there were only four people there, all police, no passersby and, of course, no tourists,” said Pere Mariné, a native of the city’s Poblenou neighbourhood. “We’re enjoying the clean air, the calm, the silence, the peacefulness, above all because we’re not used to it. But we also miss the life of the city, the good and the bad, people in the street, the discussions in the Rambla del Poblenou. The city is better, cleaner, safer, quieter and more erse, but with so much left to do.”It’s all those things, but it’s dead. Mediterranean life is lived outdoors, in cafes and bars and in the squares where people old and young sit and talk and argue. We can go out, but there’s nowhere to go. Cicero said of war, they leave you a wilderness and call it peace. We’ve inherited a ghost town.This is happening all over, of course. In Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, New York and many other cities that suddenly find themselves without visitors.“Venice was becoming like Disneyland without inhabitants,” says Alberta de Grenet who moved to the city when she was 11 and has lived there for 20 years. “Now you can see the city for what it really is, a place full of light, more a village than a city. I’m hoping we can learn something from this strange and totally unexpected situation.”“In March, all of a sudden, all we heard was Dutch around us,” says Fulco Blokhuis, a native of Amsterdam. “Suddenly you could see the real beauty of the city centre, places we have avoided for years.“We took our kids to the Wallen, the red light district. There were no stag parties, no tourists, no sex workers, no drug dealers. A memory of a lifetime.”Already Barcelona city council is talking about reclaiming the city for its residents, even La Rambla and the beach – a city with tourists but not for them. The city authorities hope that many of the thousands of empty Airbnb holiday rentals can now be reclaimed and rented to residents.In the meantime, the financial pain is going to be intense and tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. Right now we’re enjoying the peace and quiet, but soon we’ll look back to all the times we wanted the tourists to go away and leave us alone and think, be careful what you wish for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a8ad1b7e5119d8df976fa541d3ce189cdeb498/0_267_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6e21c6aa8b22aa639f6d62d3e21e170","title":"i know this much is true review mark ruffalos put upon twins","story":"There is truth in this drama about brothers struggling under the weight of life’s turmoils – but few will avoid compassion fatigue before the endWe all have to Stay Alert now, of course, in case those invisible particles are nearby, waiting to cosh us behind the ear and then make their leisurely way in through our nasal passages to corrupt our complacent flesh. It will be our own fault now because the government warned us, and we let our guard down.But in the beforetimes, the objects of our readiness to duck and cover, flee or fight, were more tangible. From 1979 to 1990, it was the sight or sound of Margaret Thatcher – an enemy almost as unifying as the coronavirus – that had many of us on a hair-trigger. And you were free to cultivate your own, more idiosyncratic, alarm systems, too. You could stay alert to fancy-dress party invitations, for example, raisins in chocolate or people who said “from myself” instead of “from me”, and shield yourself accordingly.For me, it was always Things Starring One Actor As Twins. Such endeavours are catnip to actors and, if you give most of them an inch, they will take a mile. When playing twins, the potential for excess is more than doubled there are the part(s) and the fact that the piece then stands or falls by one semi-lunatic’s performance. (All actors are semi-lunatics. Don’t worry. They know and accept, nay revel in, this.) The urge to excess is great. It takes a strong personality – or an even stronger director – not to let them go hog-wild with the opportunity.All hail, then, Mark Ruffalo in the new, 90s-set HBO drama I Know This Much Is True on Sky Atlantic, in which he plays the 40-year-old twin brothers Dominick and Thomas Birdsey. Thomas has paranoid schizophrenia, and has been more in than out of state hospitals for 20 years Dominick is bound to him by ties of love and duty, abraded by resentment, grief and fatigue. They are both the product of a home dominated by a violent stepfather, and labouring under the loss of their mother three years previously from breast cancer. She never told them who their father was, but left Dominick the unread manuscript of her Sicilian father’s autobiography, whose secrets are revealed in flashback as the series goes on.We open with a grisly, but not gratuitous, scene. Convinced that a personal sacrifice will end the ongoing Gulf war, Thomas hacks off his own hand in a public library. Thereafter, the six-part, six-hour-long series (adapted from a 900-page 1998 bestseller of the same name) starts to fold in tighter and tighter upon itself, becoming more of a mood piece than melodrama. It is an approach that might have paid greater idends at shorter length because, while the exact point will vary for each viewer, few will avoid compassion fatigue setting in, as the tale of the brothers’ relentless suffering goes on.Perhaps this is a perfect reflection of life with chronic mental illness and of caring for someone with such a condition. But art is not life, and you need to guard against the law of diminishing returns. After the library “incident”, Thomas is relocated to a high-security psychiatric prison, and Dominick must draw once more on his waning emotional resources to fight against those who, as he sees it at least, do not have his brother’s best interests at heart.While that story unfolds in the drama’s present, Dominick’s suffering continues as his childhood and more recent past unfold in memory and (slightly ponderous) voiceover. He and his wife separated and orced after the sudden death of their baby daughter. We see how the early years of suppressing his feelings and frustrations in a violent household, and then subsuming his needs beneath those of his brother as an adult, have left him unable to express himself, however dire the circumstances. His current, much younger, girlfriend has no patience with his unwillingness to pay her more than a fraction of the attention he does to Thomas, and they scream at each other across a gulf of misunderstanding and need.It is heavy stuff. There is little light and shade, and no wider, deeper commentary to be had. It is a modern-day Job’s suffering examined in careful but ultimately unilluminating detail. The strength of all the performances – Ruffalo’s of course, but also Kathryn Hahn as his still-loving ex-wife, Rob Huebel as her new partner and Dominick’s friend, Melissa Leo as the twins’ downtrodden mother (Leo is only nine years older than her supposed offspring, but that is a column for another time), and Archie Panjabi as Thomas’s new psychiatrist – makes it worth watching. But any averagely empathic person will already know all the truth that is to be found here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0693f94f3b09adf454720e4a6002dd55a0971ec/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39467ba09c93c8a18c60be1001eb5425","title":"coronavirus covid 19 pandemic two in five","story":"Perhaps this crisis will make space for us to acknowledge that our loss and our failures aren’t our inidual faultsWhen I started this column in February there was no Covid-19. We know now there was, but it wasn’t yet our daily reality.I am a fiction writer, an Ivy League adjunct professor, a mother to two kids. I was meant to write about all the ways there was no longer space for people like me to make a stable living all the ways this country’s lack of safety net – it’s merciless adherence to late capitalism, the gig economy, the broken healthcare system – were grinding so many of us down. I wrote, both before and after Covid-19, about my lack of health insurance. I might also have written about our lack of dental insurance, the pain I feel and have for years, each time I chew.I was meant to write about perception versus reality in what I do professionally. The owner of the New York restaurant Prune, Gabrielle Hamilton, wrote an essay about this recently – describing how, for so long, so many of us have been pretending that we were or were about to “make it”. We had checked all or most of the boxes we were told to check in our professions, even as our lives remained in constant states of anxiety and fear. Work – the ability not only to get it and to do it but to not ever stop it – is the attribute that is perhaps flaunted and celebrated most of all. One of the reasons many of us don’t share the ways we do not have enough money is, I would argue, because we’re ashamed to say we’re struggling. We’ve internalized that our suffering is our fault – that it is because we must not be working hard enough.I wanted to write about the pervasiveness of this feeling that there are no longer avenues to stability, because I wanted there to be less shame around it. I wanted to explore the ways that, in entrenched and fundamental ways, our struggles were more systemic than just us.In her essay, Hamilton speaks of talking to others she also thought of as successful who were actually just performing success the same way she did. Hearing them say now that they were one bad week or month from going under before Covid-19 shocked her. She discovered that, in fact, the lot of it has been a ruse for a while.It’s not just shame that keeps us quiet either. We keep our “failures” close to us because we know, especially in the markets that both Hamilton and I work in – art, books, restaurants – it’s so much about appearance. Is that book or that chef, that artist important? Why should anyone pay for her rent, her studio, her tour? Our pretending we’re not drowning is the proof we have that we might still be worth saving. Our performing stability is one of the few ways that we hope we might navigate the narrow avenues that might still get us out.A thing, though, about perpetuating misperceptions, about pretending – because you’re busy surviving, because you can’t stop playing the rigged game on the off-chance somehow that you might outsmart it, because you can’t help but feel like your circumstances must somehow be your fault – is that it makes it that much harder for any inidual within the group to tell the truth.In the last installment of this column, I wrote about inidual imagination. I wrote that our lives have not been working for a long time and much of that was a direct result of choices we made – I am inidually responsible for choosing to be a writer, I am inidually responsible for choosing to have kids. I might be able to abscond to rural Maine if we can’t afford our rent in the midst of this crisis. We might be able to find a way to stay put. But that does nothing for the other iniduals across this country, who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with no safety valve.Inidual shame and an inidual desire to succeed in ruthless systems has kept many of us quiet about this country’s failures. They’re now so blatantly apparent.One of the things I hope this crisis makes space for is more of us acknowledging and saying out loud that our losses and our failures aren’t our inidual faults. I hope we might begin to say out loud all the ways the system has failed us. To admit as a group that we are being slaughtered and exploited, that our bodies are overworked and undervalued, it takes the onus off of any one of us. It can and should make us feel less shame and less fear.Lynn Steger Strong is the author of the novel Want, to be released in July 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec7d0843b3fc4ddd593b444e553d127449997441/0_86_4824_2894/master/4824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf4ac7396ab44c8a7b62dd539684462","title":"new york coronavirus rate infections cuomo hails progress","story":"As state prepares to reopen, governor says new cases on par with mid-March – but death rate may have been far higher than believedAs parts of New York prepared to reopen on Friday, the governor said new infections had fallen to the same rate as 19 March, the date he said the state “went into the abyss”.Giving his daily press briefing in Rochester, Andrew Cuomo said: “In many ways, from my point of view, we’re on the other side of the mountain.”Cuomo shut down the entire state on 22 March, as the New York City area emerged as a global pandemic hotspot. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the state has recorded 335,395 coronavirus cases and 26,641 deaths, about a third of all fatalities in the US.But Monday also brought news of a potentially dramatic undercount of deaths in New York City. According to an analysis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between mid-March and early May, about 24,000 more people died in the city than researchers would ordinarily expect, based on the season.That was about 5,300 more deaths that had been attributed to the coronavirus during that period. At his own press conference on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that “unless something miraculous happens”, lockdown measures were “going into June”.The outbreak has been less severe in smaller cities and rural areas and Cuomo said three upstate regions had met all criteria for opening some business activity after 15 May: the Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes.Other upstate regions could follow soon, Cuomo said, though the reopening regions still needed to work out logistics such as creating regional “control rooms” to monitor the effects of reopening.Cuomo said the reopening would happen in four phases. The first businesses able to open would include construction, manufacturing and retail with curbside pickup. Additionally, landscaping and gardening businesses and drive-in theaters would be able to open statewide, the governor said, adding that the state was also relaxing restrictions on low-risk outdoor activities such as tennis.“This is the next big step in this historic journey,” Cuomo said, adding that “all the arrows are pointed in the right directions” and noting that hospitalizations were also in decline.The state is recording about 488 new infections per day, he said, which is “right about where we started before we went into the heart of this crisis”.There had been 161 new deaths in New York in the previous 24 hours.Cuomo said there were now 93 cases of a mysterious illness with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease that affects children and is believed to be related to Covid-19. At least three deaths believed to be linked to the illness have been reported in New York.To open, regions of New York must meet a range of criteria.They include 14-day declines in hospitalizations and hospitalized deaths or falls in new hospitalizations or deaths on average per day, across a three-day period measures regarding the availability of hospital and intensive care beds in case of a surge in infections the ability to administer 30 tests per thousand residents a day and the presence of 30 contact tracers for every 100,000 residents.Contact tracers will be trained online by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which developed the course with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable foundation of the former New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg.When someone becomes newly infected with the virus, tracers will be tasked with figuring out everyone who might have had contact with that person, reaching out and advising them how to quarantine themselves until they know for certain they aren’t sick too.On Twitter, Cuomo wrote: “What New Yorkers have done, nobody could have imagined. The people accomplished a great feat in flattening the curve. We need New Yorkers to show that same resolve and intelligence in this next phase.”His approach stood in contrast to that of Donald Trump, who said bullishly on Twitter “coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better, going down almost everywhere”.According to a New York Times database, new cases are decreasing in just 14 of the 50 states. Among them are densely populated states like New York and Michigan. The list also includes sparsely populated states like Montana and Alaska.New cases are still rising in nine states, including Arizona, which was pressing ahead with reopening on Monday. In the remaining states, the rate of new cases has remained relatively steady.Trump criticized Pennsylvania, a battleground state led by a Democratic governor, for not moving faster to reopen its economy. The president also accused Democrats across the US of intentionally slowing the return to normalcy, in order to hurt his chances of re-election.The Associated Press has reported that top White House officials for weeks suppressed guidelines for reopening the economy that were drafted by top disease control experts.Public health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly spent weeks preparing guidance for schools, childcare centers, businesses, bars and restaurants. The plan featured a phased reopening and advised “communities as a whole on testing, contact tracing and other fundamental infection control measures”.Robert Redfield, the CDC director, defended the decision not to release the guidance, saying in a statement he had not formally approved it. The statement contradicts his own internal emails that were leaked to the AP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c644c88c8606c260952bc630ed1aefcbd11b22/0_155_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3687fb1d0c9f2d959a84e6ad485ca5","title":"texas reopen economy coronavirus covid 19","story":"Greg Abbott has allowed businesses, stores and barber shops to open their doors even as the risk of increased cases remains highTim Handren, the chief executive of Santikos Entertainment, a small cinema chain in San Antonio, admits his business is not essential. But while the giants of the industry keep their screens closed, he has taken a different approach.Since last weekend, three of nine Santikos cinemas have reopened to the public, among the first in America to do so during the coronavirus pandemic.“Take your mask off and relax,” Handren said in a recorded message to customers. “Breathe in some great buttery popcorn smells, watch a great movie, and just enjoy some time with your family.”The reopening is among the starker examples in Texas, where one of the quickest and most expansive efforts to reignite the economy has drawn significant controversy.On the one hand, some civil liberty advocates have argued that their right to drink at bars, have their hair cut and dine at restaurants has been curtailed. On the other, many public health experts warn thousands will become infected as the state reopens.Handren, who is also the mayor of the small town of Boerne, said that although his cinemas would keep patrons 6ft apart and offer a reduced menu there remained debate in the community about whether the shutdown had been necessary at all.“Unfortunately, I still interact with people that believe Covid-19 is a hoax concocted by the media after all this time. That’s the extreme on that side of the equation … ‘We should have never shut down’. Even the lieutenant governor said that. And then there are others who want to hunker down and hibernate for the next six months. I’ve had to, as a mayor, balance health and economics.”Abbott, a Republican, last week ended a stay-at-home order and allowed businesses including barber shops and retail outlets to open. The move followed decisions in other southern states including Florida and Georgia, and earned praise from Donald Trump.The president told reporters: “Texas is opening up and a lot of places are opening up. And we want to do it, and I’m not sure that we even have a choice. I think we have to do it. You know, this country can’t stay closed and locked down for years.”In private, Abbott has acknowledged that his decision to reopen is likely to cause an increase in coronavirus cases. Leaked audio obtained by the Daily Beast captured comments during a private call with state lawmakers.Abbott, who has sought to downplay the increased risk to the public, said: “The more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility is for transmission. The goal never has been to get transmission down to zero.”Infectious disease experts predict the average daily Covid-19 positive test rate in Texas could rise from 1,053 at the beginning of May to up to 1,800 by June.As of this weekend, Texas had an estimated 16,670 active cases and 1,049 deaths. With the occasional dip, the number of cases continues to rise even while testing lags behind other states.Harris county judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat, has attempted to enforce a mandatory mask order. Abbott has publicly criticized her.Dr Andrew Miller, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Harris county, reopened his clinic last week with social distancing in place. He told the  that even after his decision to reopen, because of the pressing needs of patients, he was experiencing significant anger from those who refuse to wear masks.He said: “We’ve had some pushback from families because we won’t let them in without a mask. They’ve been ugly to the staff. While I respect their civil liberties, I am entitled to not see them.”Last week, Abbott took power away from officials who arrest Texans for certain Covid-19 violations. The move was prompted by a conservative backlash against the arrest of a salon owner in Dallas – another hotspot – who opened up against local rules. In an act that exacerbated the isions on the case, Texas senator Ted Cruz appeared at the salon to receive a haircut from the recently released owner.Houston lies in a sprawling industrial region with more than 500 petrochemical facilities, a busy shipping channel, large highways and commercial railroads, and one of the highest densities of polluting industries in the country, if not the world.Air quality, specifically particulate matter, which increases the risk of multiple lung and heart conditions also associated with Covid-19 complications, has been worse in some parts of the city despite the lockdown, leading environmentalists to criticise the decision to reopen so quickly.“It’s a blind, uninformed decision based on optimism that everything will be better, even though the evidence points to the contrary,” said Elena Craft, senior director at the Environmental Defence Fund (EDF), which coordinates a local project tracking air quality.Moore county has the highest infection rate in Texas. Its death rate is 28 per 100,000 people, almost 10 times higher than Harris county and the state average.Amarillo, the region’s largest city, situated across Potter and Randall counties, had 1,304 cases as of last Wednesday, including at least 18 deaths. The infection rate is rapidly rising. Potter county has the second worst rate in Texas, with infections doubling every seven or eight days.Just to the south, in the city of Odessa, a group of armed militia men were arrested last week as they protested alongside bar owner Gabrielle Ellison, who attempted to reopen in violation of an executive order which mandates bars should remain closed.The six men were members of a militia named Open Texas, which according to reports has operated across the state, offering armed support to business owners.Ellison, who was also arrested, told local news from jail: “I think some rights were taken away from us, which one of them was like a right to survive. We have to survive and I think those rights were stripped from us.”• This story was amended on 11 May to more fully reflect the quotation from Tim Handren, the mayor of Boerne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work - away from home - we’d like to hear from you.

Here is what the changes mean in practice.Under the previous rules, people were not permitted to meet up with friends or family. From Wednesday, people will be allowed to meet and sit down with one other person at a time from outside their household, but only outdoors and if they remain two metres apart. The previous rules limited people to going out once a day to exercise but people are now permitted to take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. The government cites angling and tennis as forms of exercise but says team sports are only allowed with members of the same household. It says people can only exercise with up to one person from outside your household (presumably while maintaining physical distancing, although this is not made explicit).The government previously told people to stay local for exercise after complaints that some rural areas were being inundated by walkers and cyclists who had driven from afar. That has changed. People are now permitted to drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance, so long as they respect physical distancing. But people from England are effectively barred from driving to Scotland or Wales because their guidance differs (see below).The advice continues to be that people should work from home “wherever possible”. But from Wednesday, those employed in certain sectors who cannot work from home are advised that they “should travel to work if their workplace is open”. This includes people working in the following sectors: food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, and scientific research in laboratories. Hospitality and non-essential retail will remain closed.Schools remain closed except to children of critical workers, and vulnerable children. The government said schools and local authorities “should urge more children who would benefit from attending in person to do so”. It is amending its guidance to make clear that nannies and childminders can work, which should enable more working parents to return to work. Reception, and years one and six of primary school could open from the beginning of June.The government says it is working with public transport providers to bring services back towards pre-coronavirus levels as quickly as possible but everybody, including critical workers, should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible. It urges people to cycle, walk or drive if possible. It says guidance for transport operators on how to ensure physical distancing will be published this week.The government advice on this remains unchanged. It states: “You are a tradesperson carrying out essential repairs and maintenance in people’s homes, or are carrying out other work in a home such as cleaning or paid-for childcare in a child’s home. You can continue work, providing that you are well and have no symptoms.” Under the rules, this means people are not permitted to get grandparents or other relatives to come round to provide childcare, but they can pay for it.The new guidance advises that face coverings should be worn in “enclosed spaces” where physical distancing may be difficult, such as on public transport or in some shops. It explicitly says face coverings should be used as opposed to face masks, which it says must be reserved for healthcare workers and others who need them. It says coverings should not be used by children under two, those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly or those with respiratory conditions.The changes announced by Johnson apply to England, putting it out of step with the other nations. In Wales, people are allowed from Monday to exercise more than once a day but unlike in England are not permitted to travel “a significant distance” from home. They are not permitted to sunbathe or meet up with others. Garden centres are being allowed to reopen in Wales from Monday provided they can ensure the two-metre physical distancing rule is followed. Councils are also beginning to work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.The only change made in Scotland is the removal of the once-a-day exercise limit from Monday. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said further changes would be considered in the coming days but the message in Scotland remains “stay at home”.Northern Ireland extended the existing restrictions for another three weeks on Thursday but the first minister, Arlene Foster, has said changes could be announced in the days ahead, including relating to open-air exercise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 11 may","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The World Health Organization says “extreme vigilance” is needed as countries begin to exit lockdowns imposed to curb the virus’ spread.Germany has reported an acceleration in new infections after taking early steps to ease its lockdown.

It said the plans “must be done in consultation with unions or workers”.Up to £14m of additional funding will be made available to help the Health and Safety Executive to police workplace practices as the economy gradually reopens. Union bosses had warned investment was vital to enforce the rules and sanction bad practices.However, the flood of papers released late on Monday warned that the guides were only “non-statutory guidance to take into account”, meaning firms would not be breaking any laws if they breached them.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said the guidance was pragmatic and would help firms to return their staff safely to work. “And as we are able to reopen new sectors of the economy, we will continue our collaborative approach, working with a wide range of stakeholders, to provide guidance for additional workplaces.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the guidelines were a step in the right direction from ministers after consultation with unions. “Getting this right is in the national interest,” she said. “If rogue employers cut corners it puts us all at risk of another spike in infections.”  She also warned that the “ government must get to grips with the ongoing crisis in PPE, as more workers start to require it.”Contactless payments and refunds, limiting the number of customers in store and keeping in-store cafes closed are among the steps retailers and banks have been advised to take.Clothing stores must consider if it’s safe to open fitting rooms, and if they do they must clean them frequently, typically between each user. They should possibly delay the return to the shopfloor of clothes that have been tried on.Customer handling of merchandise should be limited – maybe by using new displays or signage, or by rotating stock that is touched a lot. Returns to be done without contact, and items that have been brought back kept separate from other stock.Back-to-back working, rather than face-to-face, and protective screens between staff are recommended. Staff should work in fixed teams to reduce the number of people workers are in contact with.Hot desking should be avoided and more storage should be provided for bags and coats. Packaged meals could be provided to avoid opening staff canteens.Staff who usually enter through a turnstile should show a pass to security instead. Entry and exit points should be one way if possible. Desks should be cleaned and cleared at the end of shifts.Maximum occupancy in lifts should be reduced. Avoid unnecessary meetings, or hold them outside.Face masks are optional but employers must support staff who choose to wear them. Personal deliveries to the office should be restricted and contact minimised for essential deliveries, such as by pairing up the courier and recipient where goods come in frequently.Building companies must consider which staff they need on site, with support staff told to work from home where possible. Access should be restricted on building sites to encourage social distancing, while jobs and equipment rotation should also be reduced.Break times should be staggered and hand sanitiser and cleaning should be available, especially for cleaning shared tools or vehicles, such as forklift trucks and pallet trucks. Arrival times and shift patterns should also be staggered.Screens and barriers should be used where possible to separate work spaces and production lines should be reviewed to space people apart. Packaged meals should be available to avoid opening staff canteens, where possible.Pass readers at turnstiles should be deactivated in favour of showing a pass to security personnel at a distance, while alternatives should be made available for touch-based security points such as key pads.Minimising unnecessary contact at gatehouse security, yards and warehouses should be encouraged, including non-contact, pre-booked deliveries.The guidance for people working in, visiting or delivering to other people’s homes warns no work should be conducted in any households with Covid-19 symptoms or where iniduals have been asked to shield themselves – unless to remedy an urgent risk.When working in people’s homes, discussions should be held before a visit to ask that a two-metre distance be kept from those working. Avoid in-person appointments if possible.Suggested measures include working back to back, ided by protective screens. Shift patterns should be staggered and fixed working groups set up to reduce numbers in labs, with more entry and exit points made available.Use of “high-touch” equipment should be limited and equipment such as goggles washed. Air filtering systems should be installed where there is a risk of airborne particles.Kitchen access must be restricted to as few people as possible. Only one person at a time should enter walk-in fridges and pantries. Contact must be minimised at “handover” points, such as where staff pass food to delivery drivers.Customers waiting for food should wait in their cars ideally, while two-metre spaces should be demarcated where people have to queue.Laminated menus must be cleaned and paper menus disposed of. Condiments in disposable packaging are preferable.Workers should wash hands more frequently, especially before touching plates and takeaway boxes. Uniforms should be washed on site where possible. Shared delivery vehicles to be cleaned between shifts. Clear messaging, including images, should be used to inform staff who may not speak good English of the new measures.Couriers, lorry drivers and taxi drivers are all covered by this advice. Vehicles should ideally not be shared but additional safety measures should be considered if there is no other option – eg using fixed pairs of workers to share, and opening windows to increase ventilation.Employers should make sure depots are not overcrowded, and allow goods to be loaded without interaction. Alternatives to two-person deliveries, such as using mechanical equipment, should be considered. Drop-offs should be contactless.Drivers should have access to toilet facilities during their journeys and at their destinations, which could mean the employer needs to book them in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41cc55d541e58702520ad99c7cc777dcdc2671da/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edb9b6df76a834105f04a486ad48975f","title":"im a little frightened parisians edge their way out of coronavirus lockdown","story":"French capital begins cautious reopening of shops and schools despite continued coronavirus riskOn an unseasonably chill grey May morning, in coats and scarves, Paris came out of lockdown in much the same mood as it went into it two months ago: a bit hesitantly, dragging its feet, not entirely sure what the rules were of another new non-normality.“I’m a little bit frightened,” admitted Marianna Mota, reopening her florist’s on Rue Condorcet in the 9th arrondissement for the first time since 17 March. “I only hope the customers will come and I only hope they’ll be careful. We need them to be.”It nearly did not happen at all. According to local media, the government hesitated until the last minute before finally confirming last week it would lift the lockdown in the French capital and its surrounding area, the country’s most densely populated region and the hardest hit by Covid-19.Infections in the Île-de-France region remain “higher than hoped for”, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has warned, and the number of coronavirus patients being treated in the region’s intensive care units still exceeds the number of ICU beds available before the crisis began.“In Paris, we will be leaving lockdown under very strict conditions and very close surveillance,” the mayor of the 9th arrondissement, Delphine Bürkli, said on Monday: parks and squares will remain closed, as will big department stores such as Galeries Lafayette and the Forum des Halles shopping centre.Employers in Paris have been urged to allow as many staff to continue working from home as possible, or introduce shifts, at least until June. The Paris metro is operating well below capacity, with about 60 stations closed and rush-hour passengers obliged to prove their journey is essential and unavoidable. Masks are obligatory.“I mean, look around you – this is hardly normal, is it?” asked Gabrielle Rousselot, starting work at 10.30am in the back office of a bank near Opéra. Rousselot said she had returned from Burgundy, where she had spent the lockdown with her partner and three children, on Saturday. She was not finding the readjustment easy.“The office is fine, they’ve spaced out the desks and put in all sorts of protective kit – I’m not worried about that,” she said. “But the metro is frankly unnerving. It’s almost impossible to stay a metre away from everyone. And it’s just not a nice feeling, to be looking at everyone and wondering, you know, ‘How risky do you look?’”Above ground, Paris was still notably quiet, with more cars on the streets than during lockdown but not many. Authorities reported a total of just 17km of queues on the main roads into the capital on Monday morning, compared with the more than 300km of queues that would normally be seen at the start of a working week. Pushing his young son in a buggy, Gautier Kertudo, 34, a lawyer, said it was a relief to be out. “It’s not been easy in a small flat with a two-year-old,” he said. “We’ve coped, and we’re going to have to keep coping: his creche hasn’t reopened. We’re looking for a nanny … But for the time being, we’re working a half day each.”For many Paris shops usually closed on a Monday, the day was devoted to getting ready for reopening on Tuesday. “We will be back on 12 May, and delighted to welcome you all again – as long as you’re wearing a mask,” said a sign in the window of the book shop at the top of rue des Martyrs.At the locksmiths, Stéphane Peyronnet – sticking strips of orange tape on the floor to ensure returning customers stayed a metre apart – had worked steadily through the lockdown but only on call-outs. “Tomorrow’s the big day,” he said. “But we’re an essential service. People will be back.”Some were less reassured. Restaurants, cafes and bars, so much a part of the fabric of Paris, must wait until the end of the month to hear when they will be able to reopen – with presumably strict, but as yet unannounced, physical distancing rules.On the Rue de Navarin, La Belle Maison is one of four popular 9th arrondissement restaurants to have grouped together to offer a pre-ordered takeaway and delivery service, La Pantruchoise, that opened for the first time on Monday morning.“We’ve taken lots of orders. We’re actually pretty happy, and it’s certainly great to be back,” said the manager, Nicolas Chatellain, busy sealing take-out boxes. “But then we’re very lucky: we’re a local bistro, with loyal, local customers. For many, this lockdown has been a massive blow.”As for the future, Chatellain said: “We have to wait. Could we be profitable with half the tables? I don’t know. Perhaps if we start at 6pm and close at 1am. Will we be allowed, exceptionally, to open a terrace this summer? That would help. Right now, we just don’t know. Nothing’s normal any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b2269eb042691fe7ab94b9c9147378022e2a8f/0_150_4578_2746/master/4578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a5a3372114324a0f8393a9013bda6c","title":"mexico lopez obrador armed forces decree","story":"Human rights groups concerned over expanding the role of the armed forces as the country’s homicide rate reaches new highHuman rights groups in Mexico have expressed disquiet over a presidential decree expanding the role of the armed forces in public security – a reflection of the country’s worsening violence and the failure to properly prepare and equip a police force able to take on powerful criminal organisations.The decree, published on Monday by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, demonstrates an ongoing dependency on the army and navy for public security work – even though soldiers and marines have been frequently accused of human rights violations.The decree perpetuates the practice of deploying Mexico’s armed forces for policing duties as the country’s homicide rate races to new records. Mexico recorded its most murderous month on record in March – a grim tally nearly matched in April, in spite of Covid-19 quarantines throughout the country.López Obrador swept to victory in the 2018 election, promising “hugs, not bullets” and pledging to shift the focus of his security strategy to tackle what he considers the root causes of crime: poverty and violence.But Amlo, as the president is known, effectively abandoned the federal police after taking power and created a new militarised police force, known as the national guard, comprising soldiers and some former federal police.The new force has sputtered since starting operations in mid-2019 – with its first deployment to the southern and northern borders to stop migrants. Amlo, meanwhile, has increasingly depended on the armed forces, using soldiers for everything from delivering gasoline to building a new airport near Mexico City.Supporters of the president rejected talk of militarising the country and say the laws creating the national guard always left open the option that the armed forces could be called upon for up to five years.“You cannot train people fast enough at the national guard academy and the (state) governors are still unwilling to develop their own state police forces,” said Rodolfo Soriano Núñez, a sociologist in Mexico City.“It is a response to a double issue: the national guard is not really achieving its goals and the crime numbers are again off the charts despite the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af015bda6d6e3ed6b8abd9ee03d812fecbfea043/0_0_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0c0e5f63148fc35f56e2ad4f26a8ad5","title":"poland holds ghost election with 0 turnout","story":"Presidential election was not officially cancelled but polling stations stayed closedThe vote was not officially cancelled but polling stations stayed closed, leading to a strange ghost election after weeks of legal wrangling over whether or not it should go ahead.The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been accused of rolling back democratic norms in recent years, tried to hold the election despite the challenges of voting in times of Covid-19.The PiS-allied incumbent, Andrzej Duda, was the firm favourite to win, and the opposition accused the government of trying to push through the vote now to make it easier for him to win in the first round. Up until Wednesday evening, the government insisted a postal vote would go ahead.“The polling station is closed, which means someone cancelled the election. But it’s unclear who did or on what basis,” said Tomasz Trela, a leftist MP, after turning up at a school that usually functions as a polling station on Sunday.Opposition candidates believe Duda might have been more vulnerable in a later election, when the economic fallout of coronavirus restrictions is more apparent, and also complained that restrictions on movement meant campaigning was impossible.They wanted the government to declare a state of emergency or a state of natural disaster, both of which would have automatically postponed the election, but the government, which is informally controlled by the PiS party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, refused to do so, saying the coronavirus situation was not serious enough to warrant it. The decision opened up a rift in the ruling coalition between PiS and one of its smaller governing partners.Poland, like most central European countries, has kept its coronavirus figures lower than western neighbours, partly through an early lockdown that is now being gradually eased. So far there have been about 16,000 confirmed cases and 800 deaths in the country, which has a population of 38 million.The run-up to the election was chaotic, with ballots printed before there was a legal basis for holding a postal election, and no clarity on whether hundreds of thousands of Poles abroad would be able to vote. Until a few days before, it was unclear whether the vote would proceed.“It turns out that reality is not as flexible as Jarosław Kaczyński’s mind,” said Szymon Hołownia, one of the opposition candidates, in a press conference on Monday.The national electoral commission set a deadline of two weeks to fix the date of a new election, which should be within 60 days of the announcement. There is likely to be continued wrangling over the legal basis for changing the election date, and over whether the new election will be conducted entirely by post or will feature voting in person.The head of the electoral commission, Sylwester Marciniak, said he hoped for a breakthrough that would allow for a vote that would be “fully democratic, transparent and fair”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f018dfc8a9002de79daf00ba6e69caa11c9ddf93/469_508_2635_1581/master/2635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e14874b6cb7b7a9958257b47d14f8554","title":"what is the uk advice on coronavirus and face masks","story":"Why the government recommends homemade face coverings in shops and on public transportNo. The government’s advice is very specific and more limited than that in many other countries. It says people should use a homemade face covering – not a bought mask – in enclosed places where it is hard to keep two metres away from others, such as on public transport or in certain shops. But they are not going to be mandated for general use by anyone leaving the house, nor are they recommended for exercising, schools, offices or other workplaces.His statement echoes guidance given by Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, two weeks ago when she recommended the Scottish public wear face masks in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is difficult.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said there is not “strong enough evidence” to advise people to wear face coverings in public in Wales.There is clear anxiety that such advice would lead to a run on the sort of masks that are needed by health and care workers. That is one of the reasons the World Health Organization does not recommend the use of masks. There have been shortages of surgical masks and respirators around the world, including in the UK. The Department of Health and Social Care recommends people should use a scarf or make their own mask from an old T-shirt. The other concern from some scientists is that people will become over-confident if they wear one and assume they don’t need to keep their distance from others or wash their hands.The evidence shows it doesn’t protect the person wearing it because viral particles flying through the air at speed can go through it. But it can help protect other people from you if you are infected. The covering can reduce the droplets carrying the virus that you expel from your mouth and nose when coughing, sneezing or speaking. That means there is less chance the droplets will reach someone nearby or fall on to a surface like a door handle or rail that somebody else may touch before putting their hand to their face.Yes – provided you wash it after every use in case it is covered in virus. That means it’s important also to be careful when taking it off, so that any virus particles on it do not transfer to your face, and to wash your hands afterwards. You should also not touch it while you are wearing it, the government says, “to avoid hand to mask transmission of the virus”.The government advice is that children under two should not have their faces covered, for fear of restricting their breathing. Children of primary age – so under 11 – should also not wear face coverings unless they are being supervised. They are not recommended for schools. People with respiratory conditions, such as asthma, should not wear them.No. In Spain, for instance, masks are required for anybody leaving their home and are handed out at stations. France has just made them compulsory. In a number of Asian countries with low infection rates, such as Singapore and South Korea, masks have been worn universally. The new UK policy is a halfway house and couched as advice that the public can choose to follow or disregard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093bd510840bf6a36f94a5a99f550cde837c988a/0_61_4714_2828/master/4714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d310d41e25c4ba352ba0a97d1388b66","title":"the country is being run by a second rate ad agency no wonder we feel vulnerable","story":"We are told to ‘stay alert’, but if alertness could conquer this virus, we would all be fine. The message is about shifting responsibility away from the government and on to the publicSomeone won Sunday night’s Numberwang, but it wasn’t any of us. What we can do, and who we can do it with, has been turned into some sort of fake algebra with a red-and-blue PowerPoint hump. Boris Johnson, all clenched fists and lockdown hairdo, was resolute about, er, stuff. Ours is not to reason why, his is not to understand how the other half lives.He talked of a world of golf, tennis, garden centres and people who can go to work in their own cars or on their Bromptons. England in repose. Where, apparently, no one has to think about childcare. The reality is that it is the construction workers, bus drivers and security guards (mostly middle-aged men) who are dying of Covid-19 at an alarming rate, as well as NHS staff and carers. These people are called low-skilled. Many of them are his voters. He risks losing them, so must frame the back-to-work instruction as a matter of personal choice. For now.Never in the field of human conflict have so many talked about exercise to so few the right to chunter along the pavements is now dressed up as a key freedom. This exhortation to keep yourself fit in the middle of a pandemic is a peculiar form of denial, but again it is clearly about moving the narrative from collective to personal responsibility. And personal failure. We are told to “stay alert”, but if alertness could conquer this virus, we would all be fine. The anxiety many of us are experiencing is actually hypervigilance. Alertness implies we can create an antiviral force-field around us. Well, it’s cheaper than personal protective equipment, testing and all that faff.Apparently the fault is not the government’s. It is just difficult to dial down a threat such as “we’re all going to die” to “go back to work with no protection and sort of try not to get on a bus”. Instead, we have to use the dread words “common sense”. Whenever common sense is invoked, I shudder: all kinds of ideological posturing follows.Common sense may say “I’m all right, Jack” or “you get it from 5G” and “you only live once”. Common sense may say keep calm and carry on. Dominic Raab spoke of common sense: you can meet your parents in a park. Then a government source had to announce that “they can see both parents, but not at the same time – they would have to see them inidually”. Common sense turns out to be remarkably like unpoliceable chaos. And a lost father.This is not surprising because what common sense never does well is risk assessment. We are all spectacularly bad at this, and common sense or risk assessment tends to shift over time. When I was young, my mum thought her menthol cigarettes kept her healthy, and we all got into cars with drivers who had been drinking. No one wore seatbelts. Sure, boys died on motorbikes, and there were drug overdoses – we thought that when your number was up, there wasn’t a lot you could do about it.It is only later in life when you examine so-called “risky behaviour” that you see the interweaving of trauma, peer pressure and the basic tenets of your personality. Once you have kids, you undertake an exercise in risk management which at some point you fail. We want to protect our kids and make them able to survive in the world when we are no longer there. I nearly lost mine (meningitis, serious bike accident) so I learned the hard way that my anticipation of risk was all wrong. Now, in the midst of this virus, I feel far from fatalistic about it.The risk for young people is minimal and very high for old people. Every seven or eight years, your risk of dying if infected doubles. I am not complacent at all. The statistician David Spiegelhalter explained all this clearly on The Andrew Marr Show, saying that we need to be proportionate about the risk we face. He called the press briefings “number theatre” – underlining the need to communicate data properly and treating people with respect.This is the opposite of what the government has done, and people are right to feel angry. Johnson, the great risk-taker, has diced with death himself. His administration is still delaying practices such as quarantining new arrivals to the UK. He is risking the union, with other parts of the UK in open derision of his sloganeering.If we are to be run by a second-rate ad agency, with graphics from the 80s, it is no wonder we feel vulnerable. We may, therefore, take matters into our own hands. The lockdown will break from the bottom up as people need an income. The middle classes need their gardeners, cleaners, dog-walkers and nannies. Roots need doing.It is in these small and everyday decisions that advice will be bypassed and risks will be taken. Given what we have seen so far, do we think this government is capable of the sort of protection of workers that is needed? Choices will be made. And we can get it wrong. After 911, remember, many more people in the US died in car accidents 2,996 people died in the attack, but road use jumped because of fear of flying, killing an estimated extra 1,595 people in road deaths.If we don’t trust the government to protect us and make risk assessments for us, we will take it into our own hands. The public has run ahead on this. Many of us locked down before being instructed to. Doing so was a way of keeping safe and extending empathy to others through our behaviour.This moment now feels scarier than ever for, as things fall apart, the centre cannot hold. There is restlessness and there is deprivation. How can we ask ordinary people to understand their own risk when those in charge have failed to do so? But there is no other option. Dying from the virus is one thing, living with it is another."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

This was because vitamin D deficiency was common among those at risk of Covid-19 (particularly older people) there was no toxic risk from taking it at the recommended dosage level, and growing evidence of benefits.Last week, scientists at Northwestern University in the US found those with severe vitamin D deficiency were twice as likely to experience Covid-19 complications.If changing advice led to a rush of products on sale in shops, “it is not a reason not to take it . . . This is no time to hang around”, she added.“While there are currently no results from randomised controlled trials to conclusively prove that vitamin D beneficially affects Covid-19 outcomes, there is strong circumstantial evidence of associations between vitamin D and the severity of Covid-19 responses, including death.”Daily sunshineIn England, Scotland and Wales, public health bodies have revised recommendations since the Covid-19 outbreak to say all adults should take at least 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily.Prof Kenny said most scientists would recommend between 800 and 1,000 IU – she takes the higher dose – and recommended older people be exposed to 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine daily, if possible.Vitamin D is produced in the skin from UVB sunlight exposure. It is changed into an active hormone that keeps the skeleton strong and free of osteoporosis. It is also contained in many foods, such as oily fish and cheese, while most people ensure they have adequate amounts through a combination of sunlight and a healthy diet.Controversially, US president Donald Trump suggested zapping the virus with sunlight or UV but this was not related to the vitamin D connection in boosting the immune system.In response to the study, a Department of Health spokeswoman said the National Public Health Emergency Team which advises the Government on Covid-19, “keeps all national and international evidence and advice under continuous review as the basis for any recommendations”.Cytokine stormsThe TCD data, produced in collaboration with Prof Jon Rhodes at the University of Liverpool, suggests it is likely to reduce serious Covid-19 complications. “This may be because vitamin D is important in regulation and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response, which causes the severe consequences of Covid-19 and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’ associated with ventilation and death,” Prof Kenny explained.Cytokine storms seem to kill a majority of Covid-19 patients, and not destruction of the lungs by the virus itself.This study shows – counterintuitively – countries at lower latitude and typically sunny countries, such as Spain and northern Italy, had low concentrations of vitamin D and high rates of deficiency. These countries also experienced the highest Covid infection and death rates in Europe.Northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland and Sweden) have higher vitamin D levels despite less UVB sunlight exposure, because supplementation and fortification of foods is more common. These countries have lower Covid infection and death rates.Vitamin D deficiency is common in Ireland and is most prevalent with age, obesity, in men, in ethnic minorities, in people with diabetes, hypertension and in nursing homes.Dr Laird said: “Optimising vitamin D intake to public health guidelines will certainly have benefits for overall health and support immune function. Research like this is still exploratory and we need further trials to have concrete evidence on the level of vitamin D that is needed for optimal immune function.“Supplementation is the best means of ensuring sufficient vitamin D blood levels. As the effects of coronavirus continue, many of us are limited in the time we can spend outdoors, so extra care is required to keep vitamin D levels healthy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot too bad.

File photograph: InphoThree-time All-Ireland winner Seán Cavanagh doesn’t deserve to be “crucified” for referring to the North as “up here in the UK”, according to the man who posted a video of the remarks on social media. A welter of sometimes vicious attacks was unleashed on Twitter in response to the remarks, which were also seized upon by Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew, who represents Mr Cavanagh’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency. “I presume by that Seán isn’t playing Pádraig Pearse in the forthcoming film on the Easter Rising then?” tweeted Ms Gildernew. Sinn Féin councillor for Derry and Strabane Ruairí McHugh tweeted: “Mortifying.” Mr Cavanagh was discussing the GAA’s announcement last week that there will be no intercounty fixtures before October, along with pundit Pat Spillane and RTÉ online sport editor Mikey Stafford. The chartered accountant, who has offices in Moy, Co Tyrone and Dundalk, Co Louth, suggested younger players in particular be allowed to return to Gaelic games sooner to alleviate their frustration during the lockdown. Referring to the need to look after people’s mental health and social wellbeing, he added: “I just hope common sense comes somewhere along the line.” Mr Harkin told The : “Seán created this furore, not me. I don’t understand why Seán calls us the UK we are not the UK, we are Gaels. We identify as being Irish as much as those in Skibbereen or Cork or Kerry or wherever.” Mr Harkin said Mr Cavanagh had spoken out of turn. “As a Gaelic footballer for Moy and Tyrone I have total respect for Seán Cavanagh – probably one of the greatest Tyrone players ever – but I think his comments were totally out of order,” he added. But Mr Harkin condemned some of the more vicious remarks on Twitter against the former footballer, saying he didn’t deserve the backlash fuelled by the posting of the video. “I don’t agree that Seán or his family or anyone else should be taking any stick over this. I totally disagree with that.” ‘Hysterical’ reactionMr Harkin said he understood Mr Cavanagh worked as a chartered accountant and would speak about tax and financial regimes in UK and Irish terms on a day-to-day basis. “He doesn’t deserve to be crucified for it,” he said. Many also came to Mr Cavanagh’s defence on Twitter. One said: “The reaction to this has been . . . hysterical and full of outrage. He clearly meant UK jurisdiction, not country.”Mr Cavanagh did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

File photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireBusinesses in Ireland could reopen more quickly than set out in the Government’s roadmap if the spread of coronavirus continues to slow, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has indicated. In an interview on Monday on the  Confronting Coronavirus podcast, Ms Humphreys said figures showing a slower spread of the illness, also known as Covid-19, were encouraging and could expedite the roadmap setting out the timetable for the reopening of the economy, if the trend continues. “We saw from the figures this week that we are continuing flattening the curve,” said Ms Humphreys.“If that trend continues we can begin to reopen the economy in line with the roadmap, if not more quickly.”However, she said: “If the figures go against us and they go up again we may have to reintroduce restrictions.”The five-phase roadmap currently starts on May 18th, with the return of outdoor workers and primarily outdoor retailers. The second phase, due to start on June 8th, will see marts and small retail outlets reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.Pressed by presenter Deirdre Veldon on the reopening schedule, especially for small businesses like hairdressers and public houses, which will among the last to reopen, Ms Humphreys said: “If we do well on the figures and if we manage to reduce the amount of people who are contracting the virus there is flexibility in the roadmap to allow them open more quickly. “Again, we will have to be guided by public health advice but certainly the flexibility is there in the public health road map,” she said. The Minister also indicated that the Government may consider lowering the VAT rate on the hospitality sector from 13 per cent to 9 per cent. This rate was reduced by the 2011 coalition government during the last recession to assist the sector but was returned to its 13 per cent in last October’s budget by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. She said this change would require legislation and that cannot be passed until a new government has taken office. “Bespoke supports for the hospitality sector will be needed and that will be an absolute priority for an incoming government,” she said. Ms Humphreys also outlined some of the protocols that will be in place for employers, as employees return to work. They will include staggered lunchbreaks and coffee breaks, and solutions for arriving in work and for using toilet facilities. She said the solutions would be different for a small shop compared to a large factory but she trusted businesses to come up with good solutions. She said there would not be significant costs attached and also pointed out the supports available for businesses reopening after the crisis. “It is not going to cost anything to tell employees not to shake hands,” she said. On the issue of wearing face masks in workplaces, she said there was no requirement to do so at present but the National Public Health Emergency Team was looking at the issue. She said the Government would be guided by its advice.

File photograph: PA First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill are planning to announce a five-stage easing of the coronavirus lockdown in Northern Ireland on Tuesday.The two Ministers and the Northern Executive are putting final touches to the plan that is to be presented in the Northern Assembly on Tuesday, it was confirmed on Monday evening by DUP and Sinn Féin junior Ministers Gordon Lyons and Declan Kearney. With three more people dying from the virus in Northern Ireland the two Ministers stressed that the relaxing of the lockdown would be “gradual and incremental”.Mr Lyons said the easing can only “be a gradual and phased normalisation and reliant on the expert scientific advice”.“We remain committed to working with all administrations, sharing information and insights on Covid-19,” he said.He made his comments as the North’s Department of Health reported that three more people died in Northern Ireland from coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities to 438. The department also reported that 30 more people have tested positive for Covid-19, leaving the total number now confirmed with the disease at 4,149.While the process out of lockdown will be five-phased, it is expected to differ to the Republic’s road map in that in the North there will be no specific dates set down for when particular easings will take place but that each stage of process will be determined by scientific and public health criteria.It is expected that the relaxation will begin by allowing gatherings of four to six people in outdoor locations based on continued social distancing. The final phase, possibly in August, will allow the openings of pubs and restaurants.“There will be no dramatic lifting of restrictions. Each step will be incremental and cautious,” said Mr Lyons.Mr Kearney said that each stage of relaxing restrictions would happen based on the latest scientific and health advice, the ability of the health service to cope, and “an assessment of the wider societal and economic impacts”.Earlier on Monday Ms Foster told BBC Radio Ulster that Northern Ireland needed a plan specific to the requirements of the North. “The whole point of devolution is the fact that we can have localised solutions within a UK framework and I think that that is what we are doing across the UK at the moment,” she said. In an interview with the Irish News Ms O’Neill said “our plan will not be calendar led as it is in the South, where they have assigned certain dates to it”. She explained, “I would be worried about that approach for this reason : you don’t know how this disease is going to spread. What we intend to do is set out guiding principles as to how we move to each stage and what we intend to do. “We will set out different phases and they will be reviewed on a three weekly basis in accordance with the best international health advice.

Senior figures in both parties said on Monday that it was unlikely either party would nominate a person to become cathaoirleach of the committee. “No member of the party has contacted me looking at the possibility of the party supporting one of our own candidates,” said Fianna Fáil whip Michael Moynihan.Similarly a Fine Gael member of the committee said it was “unlikely” that any of its members would be nominated. The TD, who spoke anonymously, said that both parties had a combined eight votes out of 19 and that 10 votes would be required to secure the position. The Green Party has a single member on the committee, Ossian Smyth, but it is unlikely he will vote for the two-party bloc at a time government-formation negotiations have barely started with his party. It is understood Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness might also express an interest in the position when parties meet on Tuesday ahead of the first formal session of the committee at 12.30pm.

Photograph: GettyPeople in England should wear face coverings in some settings, the government has said as it published its “road map” which could include people being able to link up with one other household in a “bubble”.The new document, published just before Boris Johnson is due to deliver a Commons statement, said one household may in future be allowed to join up with one other as a way of easing the long-term restrictions on people’s lives.The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been asked to look at the model as people get set to live with social distancing measures in the long term.However, for now, people are being told to socialise only with their current household. They are permitted to meet one other person from one other household in the outdoors as long as they stay 2m apart.The new plan for England sets out what the government sees as being possible now and what may be possible in the future.The document also sets out how restrictions may be lifted and implemented on a regional basis, depending on local levels of infection.The document says “the government may adjust restrictions in some regions before others: a greater risk in Cornwall should not lead to disproportionate restrictions in Newcastle if the risk is lower”.An annexe to the document says people are unlikely to get infected if they walk past somebody in the street, but they should avoid standing face to face with somebody where possible, with standing side to side offering a lower risk.People are also urged to continue washing their hands regularly and to wash their clothes often if they work with people outside the home.Indoor places should also be well ventilated as “evidence suggests that the virus is less likely to be passed on in well-ventilated buildings and outdoors”.On face coverings, the guidance says surgical face masks should be reserved for health workers, adding: “Face coverings are not intended to help the wearer, but to protect against inadvertent transmission of the disease to others if you have it asymptomatically.”The document fleshes out announcements made by Mr Johnson on Sunday, including that people may exercise outside as many times per day as they wish, including pursuits such as angling and tennis.However, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and ticketed outdoor leisure venues will remain closed.The document adds: “You can only exercise with up to one person from outside your household – this means you should not play team sports, except with members of your own household.“People may drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance, so long as they respect social distancing guidance while they are there, because this does not involve contact with people outside your household.”However, the document warns that if “people begin to break these rules and, for example, mix in groups in parks”, restrictions will be brought in.On schools, the document says approximately 2 per cent of children are attending school in person but says schools should urge vulnerable children and those of critical workers to attend.What about childcare?The government is also amending its guidance to clarify that paid childcare, for example nannies and childminders, can happen as long as good public health measures are adhered to. This could help parents return to work.Nurseries are expected to reopen no earlier than June 1st – at the same time as reception, year one and year six return to primary schools.The government has yet to publish guidance on how workplaces can become “Covid secure” but the new road map says “social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously”.The report says that if the overall infection data suggests the virus is spreading again, the government “will have to tighten restrictions, possibly at short notice”.It also says the government is hoping a vaccine or drug treatments will be developed against Covid-19, but says this cannot be relied upon.In a foreword to the report, Mr Johnson says: “This is one of the biggest international challenges faced in a generation. But our great country has faced and overcome huge trials before. Our response to these unprecedented and unpredictable challenges must be similarly ambitious, selfless and creative.“Thank you for your efforts so far, and for the part everyone in the UK will play over the months ahead.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"border golf club holes england wales seeks legal advice lockdown","story":"If the latest lockdown advice wasn’t confusing enough, then pity the poor members of Llanymynech Golf Club. While Boris Johnson in Westminster has decreed that playing golf can now be resumed in England, the Welsh administration in Cardiff has insisted the sport remains non-essential and illegal during the Covid-19 pandemic.So imagine the bewilderment at Llanymynech Golf Club where 15 of its holes are in Wales, two are in England and one - just to add to the chaos - begins with a tee shot in Wales and ends with a putt in England. The club is seeking advice on the legality of opening on Wednesday, fearful that Welsh authorities could fine its members, or worse still arrest them. One possibility may be for golfers to play only the two and three-quarters of holes that are located on English soil in their own version of ‘speed golf’.“We are caught in the crosshairs of two competing governments,” complained Llanymynech’s greens chairman Sandy Johnson on Monday. “We are baffled. It’s absurd. We would like to provide golf for our members who have not played for several weeks. But at the same time we don’t want to encourage them to break the law.“To be perfectly honest, it’s a very difficult dilemma for the golf club to be put in. The row between Cardiff and Westminster is not helping.”The club is just south of Oswestry in Shropshire but is mainly situated in Powys, as shown by this map:The club has been proud of its dual nationality and boasts on its website: “Drive in Wales - Putt in England. Europe’s only dual country golf course.” The course traverses Offa’s Dyke, the historic boundary between England and Wales, and while hole four, a 340-yard par four, begins in Wales with a tee shot that must negotiate a tricky dog leg left, the rest of the hole is in England. Holes five and six remain in England before a brisk walk back across the border to tee off at seven. To add to the uncertainty, the clubhouse is in Wales but the club itself is registered with England Golf, the governing body for amateur golf in England, rather than its Welsh counterpart. It is unclear if  the club’s members who live in England could drive to the course and play, while those living in Wales would risk a spot fine.On Monday afternoon, the club’s ruling committee held an emergency ‘zoom’ meeting to discuss its predicament. It will now contact legal advisers with England Golf as it seeks a solution.“We don’t want our members to get arrested,” said Mr Johnson. Asked if the club might open up the two and three-quarters of holes in England, he said that was possible and added: “I just don’t know.”The club is bemused that golf remains outlawed in Wales, pointing out the course covers 125 acres, providing adequate space for social distancing. There are 500 members and never more than 50 or 60 on the course at any one time. Sian Whiteoak, the club secretary, said Llanymynech had been gearing up to reopen as soon as Wednesday until thwarted by the ergent advice. “We could always have speed golf,” she suggested referring to the possibility of playing just the English holes.Llanymynech is renowned not only for its dual country status but also as the course where Ian Woosnam learnt to play the game. ‘Woosie’ was one of the generation of ‘Big Five’ European golfers who transformed the fortunes of golf on the Continent. Peter Alliss, 89, for a long time the BBC’s ‘voice of golf’, suggested Llanymynech’s golfers could play the three holes that are in England six times to circumvent the Welsh rules. “It’s ridiculous,” he said on Monday, adding: “Well it would be hilarious if it wasn’t for the fact this virus is quite so serious.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments plan let bycabinet inability communicate properly","story":"A video of Matt Lucas mocking Boris Johnson’s confusing coronavirus address had already gone viral by the time Dominic Raab was unleashed on the airwaves on Monday morning to respond to the mounting stockpile of unanswered questions. The clip of the Little Britain star parodying the PM had been viewed three million times as the Foreign Secretary attempted to provide clarity - only for him to make the already baffling advice even more bewildering.By 10am, even the presenters of This Morning had had enough, with a clearly exasperated Phillip Schofield telling his co-host Holly Willoughby: “If this was in a farce, on the telly, I’d say: ‘This is a bit far fetched. No government would arse it up that much’. It’s astonishing. This has really tipped us over the edge today.”While hardly a bastion of political thinking, if the presenters of Britain’s most popular daytime TV programme were thinking ‘s--- show’, what on each could the public be making of the Government’s latest Covid-19 guidance?Karate black belt Mr Raab immediately went into defensive mode, insisting Downing Street\u0027s new stay alert message would remain, even though both Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, had rejected it. Wasn’t it odd that people in England, where the coronavirus death rate is the highest in the UK, were now being told to “Stay Alert”, while those in less badly affected Scotland and Wales were still being advised to “Stay At Home?Even Mr Raab seemed muddled, saying: Certainly if you live in England and live in Wales, and you\u0027re moving around within that nation, you just need to comply with rules that are in place by the Welsh executive or here in the UK, in England, the rules that we are setting out today. Eh?Having told BBC Breakfast: We need to treat people like adults, within minutes Mr Raab was also having to re-educate the nation on when they were actually allowed to go back to work.Mr Johnson had said “from tomorrow” in his speech on Sunday night - prompting a rush on public transport, only for Mr Raab to have to clarify that when the PM said ‘Monday’, what he actually meant was ‘Wednesday’.Naturally the mix up raised eyebrows among those who had already questioned Mr Johnson’s decision to leave more than 20 hours between his 7pm televised broadcast and Monday\u0027s 3.30pm statement to the House of Commons. The PM had told people to go back to work - without actually giving them the full Government guidance on how they should do it. That only came with the publication of its Covid-19 recovery strategy at 2pm, by which time thousands of Brits were back on the factory floor, in warehouses and on construction sites. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer later hit the nail on the head when he told the Prime Minister in the Chamber: “At the heart of the problem it seems is that the PM made a statement last night before the plan was written or finalised and that has caused considerable confusion.”Little wonder then, that even Mr Raab appeared unsure of the correct guidance on pubs and social interaction, following reports that the entire cabinet had been kept in the dark over the full contents of the Government’s 50-page document, entitled: “Our Plan to Rebuild”.Having insisted that pubs, restaurants and other inherently more difficult sectors, could be allowed to open from July 4 - Britain’s new “independence day”, as long as the transmission rate remains low, Mr Raab was promptly slapped down by No 10. It came after he had claimed: If you\u0027re out in the park and you\u0027re two metres apart... you can meet up with other people - only for lobby journalists to be briefed that people could only meet one person outside their household, in public, at a time. No 10 was later forced to clarify that contrary to Mr Raab’s claim that people could now “go to the park to see a grandparent with your family, as long as you stay two metres apart”, the guidance hadn’t changed on over 70s being advised to stay at home as much as possible and to take particular care to minimise contact with others. All of which begged the question, why on earth was the First Secretary and deputy PM given the morning media round without having been adequately briefed?While most people could understand the Government wanting to delay the unveiling of Mr Johnson’s “roadmap” until the end of the Bank Holiday weekend - no explanation was given for the nearly day-long news vacuum that had been created between Sunday evening and Monday afternoon.It is thought Downing Street opted for the prime-time Sunday night slot - sandwiched between Countryfile and the news on BBC1 - to guarantee the biggest TV audience. In the end almost 30 million tuned in. Yet even that timing angered Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who questioned why the PM had chosen to address the public ahead of MPs. Cabinet ministers who attended Sunday morning’s meeting were similarly unhappy that the morning’s papers were full of briefings about the Government’s new “Stay Alert” message - before they had even been told about it. The mood became even more mutinous when they discovered that the PM had already recorded parts of his speech the day before, effectively presenting them with a “fait accompli”, prompting one minister to compare Number 10’s secrecy with Tony Blair’s “sofa government”. Mr Johnson is understood to have apologised, insisting that the speech would contain “nothing new” that they didn’t know already. In the end the politicians’ turn came after Mr Johnson’s Commons statement, when they attempted to drill into some of the detail, with Sir Keir leading the case for the prosecution by suggesting clarity had been “in short supply”. For once the message back from the PM was clear - the Government was relying on the public to apply good, solid, British common sense.“Stay at home if you can, but go to work if you must,” he insisted, leaving onlookers wondering whether than might have been a better slogan now Britain is entering a new and complex coronavirus era. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"helena bonham carter tim burton wanted johnny depps ideas not","story":"It is a situation familiar to many working women: come up with an idea and it is ignored, then watch a man be lauded for proposing exactly the same thing.Helena Bonham Carter has admitted that the director of Sweeney Todd would only listen to her suggestions if she funneled them via her co-star, Johnny Depp - even though the director was her own partner, Tim Burton.“Johnny was caught in the middle. In the end, I realised I shouldn’t really have any good ideas. If I had a good idea I should give it to Johnny. If I gave it to Johnny, Johnny would mention it to Tim and then it was a marvellous idea.“If I mentioned it, it would be an absolutely c--- idea,” she told Louis Theroux’s Grounded podcast.The couple, who split in 2014, made several films together including Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Sweeney Todd was released in 2007.“I’d never sung before, he had never done a musical, and it’s that classic thing that you take your stress out on the person who you know best, and we really didn’t get on during that one. Amazingly, I got pregnant, but let’s not get into that…”A year after making Sweeney Todd, Burton asked Bonham Carter if she would appear in his next film, an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. They had a novel way of relieving the tension on set.“Tim said a year later, ‘Do you want to play the Red Queen?’ and I sai, ‘Well, you are going to have to change your behaviour a bit.’ And the way we got through that was, we both had Nerf guns, so we would shoot each other whenever we got annoyed and then it was ok.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown rules uk update social distancing","story":"It does not appear to answer the question of whether grandparents will be able to take turns to meet their children.The strategy also says that exercise is allowed with someone from outside their household - which means that parents can go for a walk with their parents, or boyfriends and girlfriends from two households can go for a jog together.It says: You can only exercise with up to one person from outside your household – this means you should not play team sports, except with members of your own household.The rules could be relaxed further, with according to the strategy, ministers now asking Sage to consider whether, when and how it can safely change the regulations to allow people to expand their household group to include one other household in the same exclusive group.The idea behind this is based a scheme trialled in New Zealand where two different household bubbles can mix as long as there is no contact with anyone outside the two bubbles.The hope is that this might reduce the most harmful social effects to make the measures more sustainable, the strategy says.The plan adds: In addition, the Government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step, in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.For the last seven weeks, the UK has been told unequivocally that they can only go outside to exercise once a day. Now, however, the Prime Minister is encouraging people to take “more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise”. It will also now be allowed to sit in the sun in your local park, drive to other destinations, and play sports - but all of this can only be done with members of your own household.Mr Johnson stressed that people must continue to “obey the rules on social distancing”, and to enforce those rules there will be an increase in the fines for the people who break them.The Government will to continue to ensure that people who are more clinically vulnerable to coronavirus than others should continue to take precautions and minimise contact with people outside of their households.This group is strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact, called ‘shielding’. It means not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions.In his public address on Sunday, the Prime Minister urged members of the public to “avoid public transport if at all possible” because of the need to maintain social distancing, and as a result of this, capacity on public transport will therefore be limited. The Prime Minister added that public transport operators will be following “Covid-secure standards”.He also urged those who must go to work to get to work by walking or bicycle where possible. The Government will increase funding and provide new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, create pop-up cycle lanes, and close some roads in cities to traffic (apart from buses) as some councils are already proposing.Social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously. He said the Government was working with tech firms to develop apps to allow people to “find out what parts of the transport network are overcrowded and avoid them” to maintain social distancing after lockdown. The Government will be managing the risk of transmissions from abroad, in order to keep overall levels of infection down. First, the Government will require all international arrivals to disclose information about their contact and accommodation. They will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app.Second, the Government will require all international arrivals not on a short list of exemptions to self-isolate in their accommodation for fourteen days on arrival into the UK. Where international travellers are unable to demonstrate where they would self-isolate, they will be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the Government.The Government is working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate implementation across the UK. Small exemptions to these measures will be in place to provide for continued security of supply into the UK.International travel measures will not come into force on 13 May but will be introduced as soon as possible. One of the most significant changes announced by the Prime Minister has been who the Government believes should now be going to work. Previously, guidance was that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you absolutely must. However, Mr Johnson has now said that anyone who can’t work from home - for instance those working in construction or manufacturing - should be “actively encouraged to go to work”. The Prime Minister has said that in order to ensure workplaces are safe, the Government has been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces “Covid-19 secure”.The Government has been consulting the relevant sectors, unions and authorities, including Public Health England, to develop new safety guidelines that can be adapted for workplaces to operate safely, and will release guidelines this week.It will also include measures that were unlikely to be effective when the virus was so widespread that full stay-at-home measures were required, but that may now have some effect as the public increase the number of social contacts.The Government will need to continue to ask all employers and operators of communal spaces to be innovative in developing novel approaches UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will welcome grant applications for proposals to develop new technologies and approaches that help the UK mitigate the impact of this virus.Other recommendations include installing plexiglass screens between desks in offices and requiring workers not to sit face-to-face but back-to-back or side-to-side, lifts only being used if half-empty, hot-desking abolished and workers not sharing equipment.Staggered arrival and departure times for employees are also being considered, as well as providing staff with packaged meals to avoid opening canteens.The drafted social distancing guidance remains quite stringent for non-office workers. For example, guidance for couriers and lorry drivers suggests finding alternatives to two-person delivery, and building sites and farms should be separated into “zones” of different worker groups with staggered break times.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"school classes have 15 pupil limit governments new coronavirus","story":"Class sizes should be split in half with a 15 pupil limit and corridors should operate a “one way” system, the Government’s new coronavirus guidance for schools says.When primary schools begin their phased reopening next month, the beginning and end of the day will be staggered to avoid congestion at the gates, according to advice published on Monday by the Department for Education.Children will be expected to spend their break times and lunch with the other children in their class, to ensure that they are only mixing within their group of 15 pupils plus their teacher.If a child displays Covid-19 symptoms and tests positive, the rest of their class as well as their teacher would need to self-isolate and they would all be offered free tests.Headteachers will be encouraged to make the most of the space in their school building to accommodate the smaller class sizes, by holding lessons in sports halls, assembly halls and libraries.The Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said it has a “high degree of confidence” that coronavirus is less severe for children than it is for adults. The group has a “moderately high degree of confidence” that children under the age of 11 are less susceptible to catching it.he Prime Minister told schools to prepare for Reception, Year One and Year Six pupils to return from June 1.The “ambition” is for primary schools to be open for all year groups by mid-June so children can have a month of lessons before the summer holidays, according to the Government’s recovery strategy.Students in Year 10 and Year 12, who are mid-way through their GCSE and A-level courses, should also be allowed to have “some” face to face contact with teachers before the summer break.The announcement prompted a backlash among teacher unions, with Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union claiming that the plans were “nothing short of reckless.”Meanwhile, headteacher union chiefs told their members that ultimately it is their decision whether or not to reopen.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said that if heads and their governing bodies feel it is unsafe to reopen, then they can decide to stay closed to the majority of their pupils.Parents will not be fined for failing to send their children to schools if they are worried about coronavirus during lockdown, officials confirmed.  Instead, families will be able to choose whether to keep their children at home even when schools are open for their age group.A Government official said that the focus will be on encouraging parents to send their children back to school rather than forcing them to.Ordinarily, children are only allowed to miss school if they are too ill to go in or if they have advance permission from their headteacher.Parents can be issued with £60 fines if their children are absent with no good reason, which doubles to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. If it is not paid after 28 days, parents face prosecution by their local authority.There are no plans for schools to fully reopen, the recovery strategy says, citing modelling by the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) which says that this would lead to a “resurgence” of the virus and a second wave that “could be larger than the first”.On Monday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, said that governments need to consider three factors when considering how to safely reopen schools.First, a clear understanding about current Covid transmission and severity of the virus in children is needed,” he told a press conference in Geneva.Second, the epidemiology of Covid-19 where the school is geographically located needs to be considered. Third, the ability to maintain Covid-19 prevention and control measures within the school setting.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"slogans far simplistic complex emergency like one","story":"Boris Johnson’s team in 10 Downing Street are justifiably renowned for their skill in crafting the perfect slogan. With “Take back control” and “Get Brexit done” they have driven home devastatingly simple messages to historic effect. Anyone with political experience can testify to the power of deploying a few words to sum up a popular cause. The one time I defeated Tony Blair was in the European elections of 1999, endlessly repeating “In Europe, not run by Europe”, then considered the outer limit of euroscepticism. Yet such slogans also have their limitations, particularly when the simplicities of campaigning are succeeded by the complexities of governing. They are designed for a specific, one-off and time-limited purpose: to get people to vote a particular way on one day of their lives with one issue in mind. They are not suited, however, to conveying complex responsibilities or dealing with changing circumstances. Slogans don’t work if you have to change them repeatedly, endlessly explain them, or if different versions are employed at the same time. Such drawbacks in trying to keep a message simple over time are contributing to the difficulties now facing Downing Street. The original “Stay home” message was straightforward and direct. It arguably led to more people staying at home than was expected or necessary, for instance on construction sites that initially closed and then reopened within the same rules. But a blunt instrument was justified in creating sufficient shock and impact to be sure of saving the NHS from disaster. Unfortunately, the more successful a slogan, the harder it is to change it. Imagine if, during the referendum, “Take back control” had been amended to “Take back a bit of influence”. Accusations of confusion and softening of the message become easy to fling. People who had nothing to do with coming up with the original message feel genuinely aggrieved at not being asked about changing it – Cabinet ministers, MPs and devolved governments alike. Indeed, for the Scottish and Welsh governments, led by opposition parties with a political incentive to differentiate themselves from decisions in London, arguments about a slogan offer them an easy line of attack. Nicola Sturgeon can make much of not knowing what “Stay alert” means, rather than having to justify, for example, why people cannot play golf in Scotland while others will do so, perfectly safely, in England. But the biggest problem of all with reducing government communication to a few words from this point on, is that we are about to embark on the most complicated national and global challenge since those remarkable scenes on VE Day in 1945. Almost every person in the country will have to change their behaviour every few weeks, but they may have to change it back again. Furthermore, what they need to do will be different from the person next door with a different type of job, or with children of a different age, or with their own transport, or who has already had the virus, or needs medical care for something unrelated to Covid-19. The economic and business complexities, as the Chancellor restricts and tapers the furlough schemes, and office workers take turns to work at the office or from home, will become much greater. The rules of international travel and tourism will vary greatly, with a new and shifting map of the world showing the bubbles and corridors within which we can move, while being quarantined if returning from the rest. I hope no one in government is seriously thinking of adjusting a slogan every few weeks to try to cope with such complexity. Even when the words are sensible enough, like “Stay alert”, each change will be the subject of increasing controversy and misrepresentation. A slogan is required when it is necessary to get people’s attention or to cut through the news among other distractions. None of that is needed now: we are all concentrating and not talking about much else. We have reached one of those rare points in history when the public has a real appetite for extensive information. They know full well that what we all have to do next cannot be boiled down to a few words. This has major implications for how ministers should present their approach. I make no criticism of Mr Johnson for his broadcast on Sunday evening – he spoke well and clearly, the direction he set was right, and the immediate decisions justified. But he would be well advised in future to present a detailed statement to Parliament first, with the accompanying documents and detail, and then address the nation. Then there would be far fewer opportunities for critics to jump on the absence of detail, or for the media to have to rely on briefings about the implications. Lifting lockdown around the world, in picturesThe same is true of the many announcements that will need to be made in the coming weeks from almost every government department as rules are changed for businesses, schools, travel and leisure. Showing people that each change is well-thought out, carefully judged, with risks duly weighed, is in itself a key part of the reassurance that they need to venture out again. The more measures are presented in Parliament, debated for hours, with detailed scrutiny, the better for public confidence. It could not be more different from an election campaign. Won’t we all get lost in a morass of detail this way? No: Boris rightly announced a new five-tier system for the severity of the pandemic. He explained we have been at level four and are trying to go down to three. If this is to be the framework to guide government decisions from now on, it is surely also the opportunity to explain to the public what restrictions they can expect at each level, in this crisis and any future pandemic. At the end of this crisis, it will probably turn out that we and other Western nations have things to learn from Germany. The death rate there has been considerably lower than in France, Italy, Spain or Britain, and they are making progress in emerging from their lockdown. But they tend to eschew the simple slogan as they work their way through the slow lifting of some controls. The day of the all-encompassing slogan in this crisis is over. The day of the rather long and painstaking explanation has dawned.  Nursery sector calls for urgent financial support as it is told to reopen its doors next monthUK faces legal challenge as experts say French quarantine exemption must be offered to all EU citizensDorset police constable charged with murder following death of 41-year-old womanPriti Patel urged to deport Rochdale sex abusers who are back in town after being stripped of citizenshipSchool classes to have 15 pupil limit, Government\u0026#39s new coronavirus guidance saysFour out of five Scottish Covid-19 deaths prevented \u0026#39if lockdown had started two weeks earlier\u0026#39Coronavirus timeline: From a few cases in China to a global pandemicPolice told by Home Office to target big gatherings after warnings eased lockdown will be unenforceableBoris Johnson says he \u0026#39hope, hope, hopes\u0026#39 that UK can develop coronavirus vaccine Comment: The Church will emerge from the coronavirus crisis even strongerNicola Sturgeon at loggerheads with senior SNP MP over border controls with EnglandFrance adopts similar message to UK as Boris Johnson denies scientists did not back \u0026#39Stay Alert\u0026#39 sloganHow Government\u0026#39s plan was let down by Cabinet inability to communicate properlyStanley Johnson\u0026#39s 1982 virus thriller set to be republished this summer Prince Harry appears on One Show to praise The Guinea Pig ClubRevealed: Government\u0026#39s 50-page roadmap out of lockdown and what it means for youCalls to reopen German borders as Merkel urges disciplineLife after lockdown: Back to \u0026#39abnormal\u0026#39 for Paris, France and some of Europe We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/25/23/Mars.jpg","title":"alien life mars water salt brine red planet","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Findings could prove good news for those hoping to explore Mars\u0027 surfaceSalty pockets of water are probably commonly\u0026nbspfound on Mars\u0026nbsp– but would not serve as homes for alien life, scientists have found.The new research modelled the Martian atmosphere in an attempt to understand whether those briney\u0026nbsppockets have the right conditions to be haitable on Earth.

It suggests that it would be quite difficult for life on Earth to travel alongside any missions and disrupt natural ecosystems on Mars, since it would almost certainly be wiped out straight away.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The fall was the steepest on record and worse than any of\u0026nbsp the 18 forecasts collected by Reuters.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 30,000 deaths. Provisional figures suggest Italy’s GDP contracted 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesItaly was one of the first to be hit by Covid-19, with soaring death rates leading to a nationwide lockdown imposed from 10 March and all non-essential production being shut down since 22 March.Industrial production is likely to have fallen even further in April, with economists forecasting a 50 per cent decline on the same month last year.Industrial production plunged across the board in March, Istat said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down.“The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March,” Oxford Economics said in a note. The decline hit all sectors, “but the 50 percent drop in transport equipment was just astonishing”, it said.The government forecasts GDP will contract by 8 per cent this year, with other economists predicting a steeper decline of closer to 13 per cent.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastPrime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday he may announce a further easing of\u0026nbspItaly’s lockdown earlier than planned.Mr Conte told newspaper Corriere della Sera that ahead he sees “a sharp fall in GDP and the economic consequences will be very painful”.Italy partially eased its strict lockdown conditions last week, allowing manufacturing and construction companies to start back up.Shops are due to re-open on 18 May, with bars, restaurants and barbers to start operating on 1 June.“We’re gathering the data from the latest monitoring and with the experts we’re defining clear safety rules for workers and customers,” Mr Conte said. “If the situation remains under control on the epidemiological level, we’ll be able to agree some earlier moves with the regions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Doctoroff, the CEO of Sidewalk Labs (a company held under Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc.) said in a blog post\u0026nbspthat it will “no longer pursue the Quayside project.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis is after Google scaled back its original proposal, which would have developed 190 acres of property and was hotly contested by the development agency Waterfront Toronto.“I believe that the ideas we have developed over the last two-and-a-half years will represent a meaningful contribution to the work of tackling big urban problems, particularly in the areas of affordability and sustainability” Doctoroff also said.Why smart cities need to be more humanThe development between Google and Totonto to create the new town – named Quayside – was intended to be\u0026nbsp“a blueprint for the 21st-century urban neighbourhood”.Innovations included retractable canopies, heated bike and pedestrian paths which would melt snow, and buildings that would “block wind in winter but not during the summer”.However, many criticised Google’s intentions in the project. US venture capitalist Roger McNamee said\u0026nbsplast year that: “The smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved version to date of … surveillance capitalism”, and suggested that Google would use “algorithms to nudge human behavior” in ways to “favor its business”.“No matter what Google is offering, the value to Toronto cannot possibly approach the value your city is giving up,” he also wrote. “It is a dystopian vision that has no place in a democratic society.”The year before Jim Balsillie, co-founder of the company behind BlackBerry, Research in Motion, said that the project was “a colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues”.Sidewalk Labs had previously said\u0026nbspthat a “data trust” would be used, so that “urban data” collected would not be shared by third parties, and that it would use “open standards for any digital infrastructure and services it provides”In a recent interview about the closure of the project\u0026nbspJohn Tory, the mayor of Totonto, said that he was “disappointed” but that “everyone acted in good faith” even though the project “got off to a bad start.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But\u0026nbspthey do not protect the person wearing them.People ought to cover their faces\u0026nbspin some shops and on public transport, but ministers say that social distancing is still the preferred means of slowing the outbreak.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said\u0026nbspthe scientific evidence was not strong enough to make the wearing of masks compulsory.\u0026nbsp“This is very distinct from the PPE worn by people in healthcare and social care settings,” he said.“We know that with this infection, people can have a period before they get symptoms when they can be infectious – probably two, possibly three days. If we can use a face covering, that may reduce the possibility of transmitting onwards.”Prof Whitty added: “This is not an alternative to social distancing. And if people have got any symptoms they need to self-isolate with their family at home – this is not a substitute.

Provisional figures suggest Italy’s GDP contracted 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesItaly was one of the first to be hit by Covid-19, with soaring death rates leading to a nationwide lockdown imposed from 10 March and all non-essential production being shut down since 22 March.Industrial production is likely to have fallen even further in April, with economists forecasting a 50 per cent decline on the same month last year.Industrial production plunged across the board in March, Istat said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down.“The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March,” Oxford Economics said in a note.

It is a powerful expression of thanks to all the Londoners who have helped distribute food as part of the Help The Hungry appeal.”The director of the National Gallery Gabriele Finaldi said the image was particularly appropriate because Sir Peter was a former associate artist at the institution.While it is closed, the gallery has been distributing images of its artwork via social media and providing free online talks by its experts.“We were delighted to help support The Independent’s\u0026nbspHelp The Hungry appeal,” Mr Finaldi said. “Thousands of Londoners have been helping to distribute the food and so we were honoured to get involved and help recognise their contribution.”Help The Hungry: Where our readers have led, the government followsWembley Stadium taken over by food charityThe projection was displayed after British YouTube star KSI had joined The Independent\u0026nbspat the Refettorio Felix at St Cuthbert’s Centre in Earl’s Court to help distribute food.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It includes tests that were posted out.\u0026nbspWe’re told 31,587 people have died. No they haven’t. It’s far more than that.”The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: “I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It’s such a missed opportunity.

It is thought he is going\u0026nbspto drop the government’s “stay at home” messaging in favour of “stay alert” – sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because its advice is not published it cannot be subjected to scientific challenge”.Had Sage’s advice been published in January, he said, “an army of scientists from our universities could have challenged why testing and contact tracing was not being modelled. They could have demanded a ramp up of testing and challenged the behavioural assumptions that delayed lockdown”.The result could have been “many lives saved” he said.Ministers insist they have followed the science amid signs of increasing tension between ministers and advisers over how to fight the global pandemic and protect the economy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Independent Premium.In House of Commons blunder, Boris Johnson wrongly tells MPs tests will look for Covid-19 in water suppliesTests could be conducted on sewage systems to identify local outbreaks of coronavirus and allow the reimposition of lockdown measures in new hotspots, Downing Street has said.But prime minister Boris Johnson confused MPs in the House of Commons by suggesting that the tests would be carried out on water supplies.His comment appeared to raise the prospect of water contaminated with the Covid-19 virus coming through the taps, when in fact it is waste water which scientists believe may provide a clue to the location of clusters of infections.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs he set out details of his recovery strategy for the gradual easing of lockdown measures, Mr Johnson told MPs the government would have no hesitation in “putting on the brakes and delaying or reintroducing measures locally, regionally, or nationally” if there were signs of a fresh spike of Covid cases which threatened to take the rate of reinfection - known as R - above one.The PM - who later compared the process of suppressing localised outbreaks\u0026nbspto the game of Whack-a-Mole -\u0026nbspadded: “The intention is the Covid alert system in time will be sufficiently sensitive and flexible as to detect local flare-ups, so that, for instance, if Covid is detected in the water supply of a certain town or in a school, in an area, then steps can be taken on the spot to deal with that flare-up.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus

intended to refer to sewage systems.“Some studies have been carried out overseas on this and I think it is something we are looking at as a possible way of seeing if you could track the rate of infections locally,” said the spokesman.Officials were investigating whether sewage samples would allow them to “track if the virus is more prevalent in some parts of the country than in others”.He added: “Obviously it is just one of a number of ways we could do that.“To the best of my knowledge, it is something we are looking at doing rather than something we are doing already.”Mr Johnson returned to the theme in the daily Downing Street press conference, saying: Part of the solution is going to be, as we go forward, responding with local responses. So if there\u0027s a flare-up somewhere in the country in a particular town or village which we\u0027ve detected with our Covid alert system, then we will be firefighting, playing Whack-a-Mole, to deal with that issue as it arises.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Before the lockdown was eased, the number of daily cases had fallen below the 1,000 mark.Many of the 205 people infected in a meat plant in Coesfeld, a city in NRW, were migrant workers from eastern Europe living in shared accommodation. NRW\u0027s health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, said that an estimated 17,000-20,000 employees in all of the state’s 35 slaughterhouses would be tested for the coronavirus, including\u0026nbspall 1,200 workers at the Coesfeld plant.While many have called for greater action in relaxing restrictions, others have criticised the government for moving too quickly.Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat lawmaker and professor of epidemiology, has warned that Covid-19 could start spreading again quickly after seeing large crowds out and about on Saturday in his home city of Cologne.“It has to be expected that the R rate will go over 1 and we will return to exponential growth,” Prof Lauterbach said in a tweet. “The loosening measures were far too poorly prepared.”To help contain any future coronavirus clusters, Ms Merkel last week unveiled an “emergency brake” which will require local authorities to reimpose restrictions if the numbers of cases rise above a threshold of 50 per 100,000 people.In recent days, five areas have broken the threshold, including the southern town of Rosenheim, where a number of cases were found in a refugee shelter. It was not immediately clear whether officials would reimpose restrictions across the town or limit measures to the affected asylum centre.Although much has been made of Germany’s rising R rate, the RKI has also warned against jumping to conclusions.The institute said that because of the fluctuations in statistics it could not yet be assessed “whether the trend of new infections, which has been falling in recent weeks, has continued or whether the number of cases has increased again”.The RKI also warned last month\u0026nbspthat the dynamics of the\u0026nbsppandemic should not be judged on the R rate alone. It is an “important factor” but “only one measure among many”, said RKI\u0027s president, Lothar Wieler.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering. They’re cooking for family members. They’re talking on Zoom to isolated elderly relatives.Millennials who had become turned off and disillusioned with public le during the partisan Brexit wars are starting to re-engage with politics, aware of the real-le impact of decisions made by our leaders.Ridiculous snowflake battles around identity politics and social issues now feel meaningless.I hope and pray that when we look back in many decades’ time, we will be talking about how the historic coronavirus pandemic of  helped create a new greatest generation in the same way the end of World War Two did  years earlier.But tomorrow my thoughts will be entirely with all four of my grandparents — Bill, Cath, RAF airman John George Wheeler and London Blitz survivor Sylvia Jean Cook — who put their coming of age aside for the good of the country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage. There is a feeling of national unity now that I have never known in my letime.From the courage of NHS workers to the kindness of neighbours, we have witnessed the best of our people during this crisis.The sick man of Europe  Not us.

Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease.

The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal.

And we need a public information campaign so rogue bosses face sanctions.“The trade union movement wants to be able to recommend the governments back-to-work plans.

And woolly guidance which is wide open to abuse really could cost lives.Last night, the Prime Minister proved once again that he’s an excellent speaker.But our economy is slowly suffocating. And rhetoric won’t save it.THE prospect of the Queen withdrawing from public le for the foreseeable future will come as a real blow to Brits.Our fabulous monarch has a knack for perfectly capturing the mood of the nation — and she is the constant we all need in this unpredictable new world.That said, it comes as a relief to us that she and her advisers are taking social distancing seriously.Her Majesty is  years old, and the most important thing is that she stays safe and well.One day, she’ll meet us again.And in the meantime, her wise and wonderful TV addresses will serve as a great comfort to us all.

Sky News reports several councils threatened to reduce cash flow intended to help the homes deal with the outbreak unless they took in Covid- patients.One anonymous source from an unnamed care home said: #My anguish and sadness is purely arisen from the thoughtless and neglectful conduct of the local authorities demanding that providers admit into their homes COVID- positive and untested residents.#This has undoubtedly caused a huge spike in infections and resulted in deaths that were avoidable.#A Tory MP has been criticised for saying the Welsh parliament should be abolished for undermining the Prime Minister.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told his country today: “Welsh law applies in Wales” as the PM unveiled his lockdown-exit ‘roadmap’.But Daniel Kawczynski said the parliament was#unnecessary#and was #picking apart our UK#.He added: “Their undermining of PM at a time of crisis will I hope start a debate in Wales longer term as to whether or not to continue with this expensive and unnecessary body.”Vice-chair of the Conservative party’s Welsh arm, Darren Miller said his comments #are not consistent with our party policy at either a Welsh or UK level#.And former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the Shrewsbury MPs outburst was because #because the Welsh government has stopped him going to his nearest beach#.Brits will be able to holiday in France as the PM and Emmanuel Macron draw up plans.The pair are brainstorming a three country ‘safe corridor’ travel plan in a bid to save summer holidays.Under the two leaders’ blueprint, all travellers will be able to cross freely between Britain and France despite tough new coronavirus restrictionsBoris Johnson has said he knows those still shielding during coronavirus will feel “anguish” as the lockdown is gradually eased. Speaking in the House of Commons earlier today he said: #I know that easing restrictions for the many will only increase the anguish of those who must remain shielded. “So the Government will look at every possible way of supporting the most vulnerable.#In an interview with Channel , the Surrey handyman said: “Its sort of leaving it up to us a little bit … to you know,you feel safe to do so then do it.”In an interview with Channel , the Surrey handyman said: “Its sortof leaving it up to us a little bit … to you know,you feel safe to do so then do it.”“Its not really hard to understand,” he added.It comes as scores of Brits have come forward to defend the PMs plans amid criticisms of being unclear.Britons have been urged to stay away from beauty spots as the Government yesterday announced travel would be allowed for exercise.Authorities from travel hotspots across the UK urged people not to flood their beaches, lakes and villages, while Brighton council told would-be tourists to just #stay away#.Cornwall, Cumbria and the Cotswolds were among some of the regions which said they wouldnt be welcoming tourists despite the lockdown easing.Police watched on as crowds of gathered outside a Cork church to mourn the loss of two brothers from the Cash family # despite social distancing rules.The mourners were seen mingling outside Farranree Church on the north side of the city as the funeral mass took place inside.Concerned locals watched on, claiming the group showed little or no regard for social distancing.Many were seen shaking hands, embracing and standing in groups as the funeral cortege made its way to the church, the Cork Beo reported.The publication said people appeared to have travelled great distances to attend the funeral as cars and camper vans seen parked outside the church displayed registrations from dferent counties around Ireland and from the UK.The Government revealed as part of lockdown restrictions you can meet one person outside your household # as long as you’re outdoors and are socially-distanced. But the First Secretary of State today then sparked confusion minutes later when he said that one person could meet two of their parents at ONCE.Mr Raab was asked on Radio  this morning: #From Wednesday, you can meet one person from outside your household. Does that mean you cant meet two relatives at the same time, for example, parents #He replied: #As from Wednesday, people can go outside to parks and certain sports where you can keep social distancing at m, together, with others members from their own home.#If you are going to the park and you can stay m apart, you could meet up with other members of your household.#And he was asked again: #So, you cannot meet two parents at the same time #He added: #You couldthey are two metres apart.#Step one: Using the scissors cut a line across the width of the t-shirt around cmStep two: From the top of the right hand corner of the fabric, measure cm below this and then make a cm horizontal cut through both sides of the fabricStep three: The next step is to cut downwards until you reach cm above the edge. Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.The government have revealed coronavirus testing will be rolled out to teachers, staff and pupils who have symptoms as schools prepare tosome kids to the classroom next month.It comes as Ministers try to reassure worried parents its safe for children toto school.Kids won’t be asked to wear masks, either nor will teachers and staff.Prof Chris Whitty tonight reassured Brits the risk of the virus to children is “very, very low”.He said it’s “one of the only good things” about the virus.Class sizes will be cut in half as some children couldto school as of June .Classes will be slashed to no more than , and pupils sat apart to try to limit any spread of coronavirus.Ministers admit they cannot keep classmates two metres away from each other all day.So instead these mini classes will be self-contained ‘bubbles’ and not allowed to mix with other kids at the school, new guidelines published tonight say.Lunch, play breaks and daily drop off times will all be staggered to stop pupils meeting each other outside of their little groups.British schoolchildren could be required to attend dferent schools as the lockdown eases.The Government has said some children couldto school as early as June .New measures will be in place to encompass as much social distancing as possible # butschools dont have enough resources, parents may have to send their kids to a nearby school instead.The UK’s death toll is at least , higher this year than it has been on average for the last five years.Figures recorded across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland include deaths from all causes # but are considerably higher since coronavirus began to ravish Britain.The , excess deaths which occurred this year are unlikely to all be due to coronavirus # although the deadly bug, which has so far killed , people across the UK, counts for a large proportion.The Prime Minister this evening encouraged workers to speak to their employers before ing to work.He reiterated no-one should be forced to work in conditions without appropriate social distancing and encouraged anyone who may have issues with childcare to continue to work from home.For more information on ing to work, read our article here. Asked about who to trust with #conflicting statements# between Scotlands First Minister and himself Boris Johnson reiterated a #four nation approach# would be taken to easing lockdown. He said its #entirely right# devolved nations will take a slightly dferent approach.Prof Chris Whitty said it is important to reinforce that coronavirus is only serious in a #minority of cases#.He said a signicant proportion of the population will never get Covid, while a high number of people will have it asymptomatically.Of those with symptoms, Prof Whitty said # per cent of people will have a mild disease, and be in bed for a couple of days, but not need to see a doctor#.An unfortunate minority will end up in hospital needing oxygen treatment, while a #small minority will then end up in critical care#, he added.#If you look at the curves, because of the work the whole country has done, they are coming down,# Prof Whitty said.He estimated that around one per cent of people die of coronavirus in the UK, adding that number could be lower.#I want to reinforce a sense of perspective. We cant get away from the fact thatwe left the virus to run we would be in a situation with more deaths and the NHS overrun.#The Prime Minister has confirmed anyone travelling between Ireland and the UK wont be subject to the new mandatory -day quarantine.He also said anyone travelling between GreatBritain and Northern Ireland wont need to isolate either.The Chief Medical Officer has said the coronavirus risk to children is #very, very low#.He added it was the #only good thing# about coronavirus.Chief Scientic Officer, Prof Sir Patrick Vallance said we cant guarantee a vaccine to combat coronavirus, pointing out we still dont have one for Sars.Sir Patrick said there are encouraging signs from the trials at Oxford University and other universities. But, he cautioned: #Itsa very tough thing to do# so far, so good. The chances are higher, but you never know until you get one.#Other options include drug treatments, and Sir Patrick said he would be #surprised#we dont end up with something to tackle Covid- # adding hopefully we will have both a vaccine and treatments.Chief Scientic Adviser, Prof Sir Patrick Vallance said it is #very, very important# that we move through the three stages slowly, to avoid pushing the rate of infection # the R value # up above one.He said the new Covid alert system that is being put in place, is crucial to let us know where we are on that scale.Sir Patrick said #we must all be alert during this, in terms of hand washing and understanding the role we play#, adding thatthe public does not play their part, infections could increase and stricter lockdown measures will have to be reintroduced.Asked this evening whether the UK could be living with lockdown measures not just in  but for the foreseeable future, the PM said he couldnt say when measures will end. He said: #Am I absolutely certain we wont be living with this for a long time  I cant say that.#The CSA Patrick Vallance has said the new stay alert slogan is crucial.He said: #The alert system thats been put in place is a crucial part of it. It is obviously true we must all be alert in this.#The PM tonight said social distancing measures will be in places on public transport, as well as more capacity. He saidpossible there will be #more tubes, more busses, more trains# as Brits slowlyto work.The extra transport should help to ease stress on social distancing measures, and help to avoid packed commutes.Englands top doctor, Prof Chris Whitty said that the plan is designed to help the country take #very small steps# to make sure we dont see an increase in transmission again.He said while the risk of transmission outside is #much lower# its not without risk, which is why social distancing rules are still so important.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need to keep an eye on it and make sure that any mutations don’t invalidate any of these approaches.Early on in the coronavirus outbreak, scientists revealed that the new coronavirus is “ to , times” more efficient at infecting people than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome– which killed  people in a year in  .This is because the shape of its spike protein allows it to bind to human cells more efficiently than Sars.The dference may have helped the latest coronavirus infect more people and spread rapidly around the world.Mutations in the spike protein are concerning - particularly as it is the main target of leading vaccines around the world, andit changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.Other potential therapies, such as synthetic antibodies that home in on the spike protein, could be less effective, too.Prof Hibberd added: This is an early warning - eventhese mutations are not important for vaccines, other mutations might be and we need to maintain our surveillance so we are not caught out by deploying a vaccine that only works against some strains.”In their study, the researchers identied two broad groups of coronavirus that have now spread globally.Of the two spike mutations, one was found in  viruses around the world, with the other present in only .The study shows that, until January, one group of coronaviruses in China escaped detection because they had a mutation in the genetic region that early tests relied on.More recent tests detect all of the known types of the virus.A team of scientists last month proved coronavirus wasn’t made in a lab by analysing the genetic template for spike proteins - silencing conspiracy theories.They found that the spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a feature on the outside of human cells which blood pressure.And the spike proteins were so effective at binding the human cells, in fact, that the scientists concluded it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, this is not a rule and the science is complex.The key thing is to not be too close to people for more than a short amount of time, as much as you can.Keep your hands and face as clean as possible. Wash your hands often using soap and water, and dry them thoroughly.Use sanitiser where available outside your home, especially as you enter a building and after you have had contact with surfaces. Avoid touching your face.. Wet your hands with water. Apply enough soap to cover your hands. Rub your hands together. Use one hand to rub the back of the other hand and clean in between the fingers. Repeat with other hand. Rub your hands together and clean in between your fingers. Rub the back of your fingers against your palms. Rub your thumb using your other hand. Do the same with the other thumb. Rub the tips of your fingers on the palm of your other hand. Repeat with the other hand. Rinse your hands with water. Dry your hands completely with a disposable towel. Use the disposable towel to turn off the tapWork from homeyou can. Many people can do most or all of their work from home, with the proper equipment and adjustments.Your employer should support you to find reasonable adjustments to do this. However, not all jobs can be done from home.If your workplace is open and you cannot work from home, you can travel to work.Avoid being face to face with peoplethey are outside your household.You are at higher risk of being directly exposed to respiratory droplets released by someone talking or coughing when you are within m of someone and have face-to-face contact with them.You can lower the risk of infectionyou stay side-to-side rather than facing people.Reduce the number of people you spend time with in a work setting where you can.You can lower the risks of transmission in the workplace by reducing the number of people you come into contact with regularly, which your employer can support where practical by changing sht patterns and rotas to match you with the same team each time and splitting people into smaller, contained teams.You can lower the risks of transmission by reducing the number of people you come into close contact with, so avoid peak travel times on public transport where possible, for example.Businesses should take reasonable steps to avoid people being gathered together, for example by allowing the use of more entrances and exits and staggering entry and exit where possible.If you have to travelthink about how and when you travel.To reduce demand on the public transport network, you should walk or cycle wherever possible. If you have to use public transport, you should try and avoid peak times.Employers should consider staggering working hours and expanding bicycle storage facilities, changing facilities and car parking to help.Wash your clothes regularly. There is some evidence that the virus can stay on fabrics for a few days, although usually it is shorter, soyou are working with people outside your household wash your clothes regularly.Changing clothes in workplaces should only normally be considered where there is a high risk of infection or there are highly vulnerable people, such as in a care home.If you need to change your clothes avoid crowding into a changing room.Here, Laundryheap CEO Deyan Dimitrov shares his top tips on how to wash your clothes to ensure you banish Covid-.. The hotter the betterOur core body temperature runs at an average of C, and provides the ideal conditions for bacteria and viruses to thrive.This meansyou’re looking to fight off the dreaded coronavirus, the much revered C wash might not always pack the punch needed.Most viruses won’t survive in temperatures over C, so you could opt for this setting items that are particularly germ ridden and washed less often, like tea towels, bedding, bath towels, gloves, scarves, and children’s clothing.. Take extra stepsExtreme heat and freezing temperatures can stop bacteria from multiplying, soyou’re doing laundry, take the extra steps and throw your washed items into the tumble drier for  minutes for some added heat and germ killing action.Equally,you’re looking for the motivation to iron, this is it! Iron temperatures can reach over C - not much can survive that.. Clean machinesWashing machines are criminally neglected from our cleaning agendas.But once you realise just how much dirt and grime these machines can harbour, you won’t be taking the risk again.Avoid contaminating your clothes with the machine itself by pouring a cup of white vinegar directly into the drum and starting a hot wash cycle of at least C.Try this every month to avoid any build up of soap, mould and bacteria.. Get the formula rightToo much detergent will create extra soap suds which will cling to your laundry and trap dirt there, rather than lt it away.Similarly, an excess of suds will only create further build-up of soap scum in your machine.Instead, opt for the recommended dosage, and when it comes to fabric softener, try giving white vinegar a go instead of chemical alternatives.. Disinfect effectivelyWhen someone in the home has been poorly, be sure to disinfect quickly and effectively.Handle all bedding and clothing with rubber gloves and wash straight away - never leave to sit in a hamper!Keep indoor places well ventilated. Evidence suggests that the virus is less likely to be passed on in well-ventilated buildings and outdoors.In good weather, try to leave windows and doors open in places where people from dferent households come into contact – or move activity outdoorsyou can.Use external extractor fans to keep spaces well ventilated and make sure that ventilation systems are set to maximise the fresh air flow rate.Heating and cooling systems can be used at their normal temperature settings.If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet.This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example on public transport or in some shops.The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect othersyou are infected but have not developed symptoms.If you have symptoms of Covid-you and your household should isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this.A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers these supplies should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards.Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary school age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.You should follow the advice given to you by your employer when at work.Employers have a duty to assess and manage risks to your safety in the workplace. The Government has issued guidance to help them do this.This includes how to make adjustments to your workplace to help you maintain social distance.It also includes guidance on hygiene as evidence suggests that the virus can exist for up to  hours on surfaces.Frequent cleaning is therefore particularly important for communal surfaces like door handles or lt buttons and communal areas like bathrooms, kitchens and tea points.You can see the guidance on GOV.UK and can ask your employeryou have questions.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but failed to reassure expectant couples when their big days can go ahead.In March, the PM announced a ban on all weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies - although funerals have still been allowed.The issue came up on BBC Radio s Westminster Hour last night -

but must stick to social distancing rules, the Prime Minister says. In a new -page document detailing changes to lockdown, Boris Johnson reveals that mums-to-be do not have to practice shielding - meaning they are allowed to leave the house.The document reads: It remains the case that some people are more clinically vulnerable to Covid- than others.These include those aged over , those with specic chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women.These clinically vulnerable people should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded.Despite this, women who are pregnant with signicant heart disease, congenital or acquired - must practice shielding.The Government defines shielding as staying at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact and not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions.Generally, pregnant women do not appear to be more likely to be seriously unwell than other healthy adultsthey develop coronavirus.The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistssay: It is expected the large majority of pregnant women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms.Cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss of sense of smell are other relevant symptoms.More severe symptoms such as pneumonia, seem to be more common in older people, those with weakened immune systems or long-term conditions.As yet, there is no evidence that pregnant women who get this infection are more at risk of serious complications than any other healthy iniduals.There is also no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriageyou do contract coronavirus.Emerging evidence suggests that transmission from a woman to her baby during pregnancy or birth is probable.There has been a report of two cases in which this seems likely, but reassuringly the babies were both discharged from hospital and are well.In all previously reported cases worldwide, infection was found at least  hours after birth.It is important to emphasise that in all reported cases of newborn babies developing coronavirus very soon after birth, the baby was well.Given current evidence, it is considered unlikely thatyou have the virus it would cause problems with a baby’s development, and none have been observed currently.As a precaution, RCOG say  you are pregnant, you should follow government advice about social distancing, stay away from public places and avoid anyone who has symptoms suggestive of coronavirus.It is still considered necessary for pregnant women to go out for essentials, such as food shopping, exercise and to attend antenatal appointments.RCOG say thatyou are in your third trimesteryou should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimising any contact with others.RCOG say: If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwe, or out-of-hours, your maternity team.They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.If attendance at the maternity unit or hospital is advised, pregnant women are requested to travel by private transport, or arrange hospital transport, and alert the maternity triage reception once on the premises, prior to entering the hospital.Pregnant women may wish to consider online fitness routines to keep active, such as pregnancy yoga or Pilates.Pregnant women are advised not to attend maternity triage units or AE unless in need of urgent pregnancy or medical care.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it would have to be on a “strictly reciprocal basis”.This could include the over-s who are in the “clinically vulnerable” category who do not need to be shielded but are advised to “minimise contact with others outside their households”.Butthe over-s are included in the ‘double bubble’ plan, it would force an appalling choice on households who still have two sets.Speaking today, Boris said: Nothing can substitute for human contact and so the Government has asked SAGE when and how we could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household, on a strictly reciprocal basis.The PM also published a y plan to get the country back to school and work - without risking a huge second wave of infectionsLast night he gave a statement outlining the three stages of his plan, and todays document features some of the small print.But lots of the details are still missing from the huge document, with it raising more questions than it answers.Boris will give a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon and will reveal more of his thinking to MPs, who will get a chance to quiz him on it.Last week Scotland revealed it was looking at similar proposals.A Scottish government document outlining the plan stated: “We are consideringand how we could make changes to allow people to meet with a small number of othersoutside their own household in a group or “bubble” that acts as a single, self-contained unit, without connections to other households or bubbles.“It is possible that this option would be introduced first for outdoor meetings, ahead of any change to permit indoor meetings of the bubble.”You would still have to stick to social distancing rules when you spent time with anyone in your bubble.Earlier Dominic Raab announced Brits can meet one friend or family member they dont live with in a park - as long as they are two metres apart.Yesterday it was confirmed that people could go out and meet up with one other person outside their household - such as a friend of family.Butthey are from another household they must stay m apart at all times.However, the coronavirus laws ban groups of more than two people meeting up at once. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" "},{"url":null,"title":"factories building sites screens loos coronavirus","story":"FACTORIES and building sites have revealed new measures to protect workers as Britains coronavirus lockdown eases.One-way walking, a ban on communal loos and plastic protective shields are among the steps firms are taking to safeguard staff.Last night, Boris Johnson urged factory and construction workers to go back to work as the PM addressed the nation with his three-step roadmap to recovery.But with fears social distancing measures will be hard to enforce in many workplaces, companies have installed signs reminding workers to stay two metres apart.Extra washing facilities, hand sanitiser and the closure of canteens are also being rolled out.Nidec Control Techniques, an electronics firm in Newtown, Mid Wales which employs  people, has installed  wash stations.Anyone visiting the units must place a cone outside the door to make sure only one person at a time goes in, with the door opened by foot from inside with a pedal.The company has installed moveable plastic shields to protect workers, and a new one-way system so staff stay two-metres apart on the factory floor.Operations director Huw Mills told the BBC: There is no people passing each other which would breach the two-meter rule.You will not bump into anybody.Speaking about the moveable screens, Mr Mills added: This is something that our engineers have innovated, something that were using.In a manufacturing space you do need to get up and close and personal with people.Our engineering team knocked up a mobile screen on wheels.It comes as Covid- deaths in the UK rose to , after  more deaths were recorded today, the lowest daily rise in six weeks.During Britains virus lockdown, Nidec Control Techniques had shut down production for three weeks, but has now reopened.One worker said: Sometimes you do have to think about it, because you see someone, and you... get into a conversation, and then you think, oh wait, step back.Were doing the best we can. Usually theres four people on a line, but its just two of us so were just trying to keep the pace and carry on.Another said: Youre here, youre here for eight hours and youre working, so it takes your mind off it.Its only when you get home you see the news again.Sitting at home for weeks on end is boring, you get lethargic, here youre active again, and its nice to meet your friends again.Nidec Control Techniquesn president Anthony Pickering said: Our facilities are as safe as we could possibly get it. If we find other ways we will obviously look at them.But this is the unknown, theres no textbook telling you what to do.Weve had to figure this out as we go along.Speaking last night,the PM insisted the government wants to ensure everyone is safe at work with new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.He said: We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.Last week, a survey revealed three-quarters of building sites across England and Wales have reopened, according to Build UK.The trade body said  per cent of sites were back up and running.One firm, Weston Homes, which has reopened sites across London, has said construction staff, delivery drivers and site visitors will be required to thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water and on all sites.The building firm has also created bespoke wash stations for site staff, with sinks containing an independent water supply and hand sanitiser.Meanwhile, Brits in some blue-collar jobs are most likely to die from coronavirus, shocking new figures revealed today.Male security guards are at the highest risk - and are more than four times as likely to die from coronavirus than the average man, while the threat to male bus and coach drivers is more than double.Cab drivers, shop workers, chefs and security guards are among those most likely to die from Covid-,  according to the Office for National Statistics.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are very limited places to eat, other than takeaways.We do not believe that this is staying alert - to undertake a long, unnecessary journey.At this time we ask you to stay away, and in the comfort of your own home, plan a future break to Cornwall when it is safe to do so.The bottom line though is that we dont want people turning up in Cornwall on Wednesday.Nancy Platts, leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, said: We want a slow, steady and safe progression towards lockdown lting.The council released a statement, saying: We want to make sure we are stepping forward in a measured way. We know restrictions will need to stay in place for a long time to come.We want the restrictions to be lted carefully in a positive direction. Our priority is to keep people who live in the city safe. One concern is around how residents can maintain physical distancing in our busy citywe have an influx of visitors.The Prime Minister has said that hospitality and leisure businesses are not likely to open before July. The shops and attractions are still closed and we want people who do not live in Brighton and Hove to stay away.James Mason, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: In March we asked people to stay away from our many beauty spots - coastline and countryside - to prevent the spread of Covid-.We welcome the road map to recovery but with caution. Please respect that these communities are not yet able to cope with tourism.The Forestry Commission also urged people to stay at home and only travel to woodsthey live nearby and are able to walk there.A spokesman told MailOnline: Although this is great news and we look forward to welcoming visitors back to the nations forests as soon as we can, our priority is to keep people safe.Please continue to avoid making unnecessary journeys and do not travel to the nations forests. Local people can still walk and cycle to our forests but must follow government rules on social distancing.South Lakes police took to Twitter and told would-be travellers to take a long hard look at their conscious before heading to the Lake District.Sharing a map which showed the North West as the worst affected area of the UK, they said: Before considering travelling to #Cumbria #LakeDistrict please grab a brew, examine this map, and take a long hard look at your own conscience.We urge you to use common sense and to continue to exercise close to your own home.

We will be having spot inspections to make sure businesses are keeping employees safe.And Business Secretary Alok Sharma later said: This guidance provides a framework to get the UK back to work in a way that is safe for everyone. These are practical steps to enable employers to identy risks that COVID- creates and to take pragmatic measures to mitigate them.And as we are able to reopen new sectors of the economy, we will continue our collaborative approach working with a wide range of stakeholders, to provide guidance for additional workplaces.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the safe corridor will not kick in until at least halfway through next month.Entry into France is still heavily restricted until at least June , after Mr Macron extended the need for all visitors to the country to fill out a form stating their reason for travel.And for the moment, authorities on both sides of the Channel have also made it clear that visits to holiday homes remain banned. Paris move to exempt the UK from quarantine measures mirrors Brussels decision not to include us in an EU-wide ban on overseas arrivals.But No s plan to only reciprocate with France risks causing tensions with other European nations. The EU Commission will tomorrow unveil a new strategy for getting travelling up and running again as the continent emerges from the crisis.Transport commissioner Adina Valean said: Its been a very hard and unprecedented couple of months. But now were getting signs we may soon emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. Its a good time to look to the future of our transport system.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed to MPs yesterday that there would be flexibility and exemptions in the  day quarantine order.The Sun also revealed yesterday that sports stars will also be exempt to allow international competition to restart.Defending the Governments decision not to introduce the measure before now, Mr Raab said: The reason that the measures are being introduced now is because the advice that weve always had is that there was little point,any, in introducing quarantine at the border with the R level and the level of, the prevalence of the virus at a high level, particularly above the R level”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is a plan that should give the people of the United Kingdom hope — hope that we can rebuild, hope that we can save lives, hope that we can safeguard livelihoods.“It will require much from us all: that we remain alert that we care for those at most risk that we pull together as a United Kingdom.”The document sets out a rough timeline for a gradual reopening of society in three steps.Step  started today with changes to unlimited exercises.Garden centres will open on Wednesday. Non-contact sports such as tennis, golf and angling will be allowed.People can play only with those in their own household or one other person and must keep two metres apart.Basketball courts can open but people will be allowed to play team sports only with fellow household members.And it will be possible to meet one other person from another household in an outdoor space as long as they keep two metres apart.Speaking in the Commons today, Mr Johnson said: “You can now walk, sit and rest in parks.”Step  from June  could see households choosing one other group to include in their “double bubble”.The move — aimed at limiting the risk of inter-household transmissions of the virus — could also help familiesto work by two households sharing childcare.Government scientic advisers said the “bubbles” could include the over-s, despite this age group being in the “clinically vulnerable” category.But the plan would not apply to around . million in the “clinically extremely vulnerable group” who have cancer or other illnesses — many of whom are aged over .They are “strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact” — known as “shielding”.The Government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty said: “We are looking at how to balance those risks in terms of households who are over s.”Primary school children could also start ing to school.

He also advised pregnant women and those with underlying health issues against meeting others to protect themselves from coronavirus.It comes after the Government eased lockdown restrictions in England, allowing people to exercise more outside and to meet a pal or a family member in the park.Speaking in the House of Commons today, Mr Johnson said: Iaposm sorry to say we shall continue to ask those who are clinically vulnerable, including pregnant women and people over , or those with pre-existing chronic conditions to take particular care to minimise contact with those outside their households.And we must continue to shield people who are extremely vulnerable - they should remain at home and avoid any direct contact with others.According to the Express, he added: I know that easing restrictions for the many will only increase the anguish of those who must remain shielded. So the Government will look at every possible way of supporting the most vulnerable. Addressing the nation from Downing Street last night, the Prime Minister provided the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. People in England will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, sit and sunbathe in parks and on beaches, and go for a drive from Wednesday. But the vast majority of rules imposed on March  remain in place - as Mr Johnson warned this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday.

So today, even as the public lined up to complain that they were confused, he decided to explain it all again in French. The Prime Minister’s baffling press conference also saw him accidentally declare “I hope we can achieve a virus” - the one thing he’s actually managed to accomplish already.He meant to say “I hope we can achieve a vaccine”. Earlier, there was the truly frightening moment when he very nearly sent Britain into a nightmarish, Mad Max-esque Evian stockpiling crisis. He briefly, accidentally - and very, very wrongly - appeared to suggest Covid- might get into the taps. It can’t. I can’t express strongly enough how much the Prime Minister was plain wrong on this. But astrying to one-up that time his loose lips might have landed a lady in a middle-eastern prison for longer than strictly necessary, Johnson casually declared regions might get shut down for longerscientists found the virus in “the water supply.” Cue thousands of understandably concerned voters taking to the internet trying to find out what in god’s name the Prime Minister was talking about. Number  confirmed the PM had simply misspoken, and what he meant to say was that scientists will be looking for the virus in sewage. Which, while reassuring on most level, is also…kind of gross. Even those paying really close attention to the PM’s ramblings might have been left with the impression you can only meet your mum in the parkshe’s carrying a mop and bucket and wearing a mask made out of an old Motorhead t-shirt. But ever the details man, the Prime Minister insisted the public didn’t need him to explain things for them.  The British people can use their “common sense”, he declared, as a pitully depleted team of posh-boy cheerleaders waff-waffed behind him. And while that’s probably true for most things, it’s pretty loose advice when the penalty for getting it wrong is tens of thousands of deaths. Of course, the advantage for Johnson of urging people to use their common sense is that he can blame it on the British peopleit all goes wrong. Point is, it’s unfair to ask us to use our “common sense” in this situation, not because we donapost have any - we do. Of course we do.

The Government expects pre-school children to be able toto early years settings, and for Reception, Year  and Year  pupils to be back in school in smaller sizes, from the start of next month. It aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. The Governmentaposs Covid- recovery strategy said that the ambition is for all primary school children toto school before the summer holidays for a monthfeasible - but this will be kept under review. The Department of Education will engage with schools and early years providers to develop further detail and guidance on how schools should facilitate this. The -page strategy, published on Monday, added that secondary schools and further education colleges should prepare to begin some face-to-face contact with Year  and  students who have key exams next year.Schools, colleges and nurseries closed seven weeks ago due to the coronavirus outbreak, remaining open only for vulnerable youngsters and the children of key workers.  The strategy says local authorities and schools should urge more vulnerable children, as well as the children of critical workers, to attend school as there is a large societal benefit. The Government is also amending its guidance to clary that paid childcare, such as nannies and childminders, can take place subject to being able to meet its key public health principles. The strategy document says this should enable more working parents toto work.  Yesterday it was reported how the majority of secondary school pupils will not attend classes before September at the earliest. The only secondary school pupils likely to attend school in any form before September are pupils in Years  and , who will be able to have some face-to-face time with teachers to support their home learning. Government officials said the remaining secondary school age pupils in England would not be expected toto school before the summer holidays. one headteacher expressed concerns about how social distancing could be managed, particularly with younger children. Bryony Baynes, headteacher of Kempsey Primary School, told the PA news agency: Iaposm slightly flabbergasted. I understand that we need to begin the sense of ing to normality, and I understand that a big part of ing to normal is getting the school back up and going.

Until now ministers and scientic advisors have been reluctant to encourage people to wear masks - despite many people in the UK choosing to wear them. This is partly to protect stocks for doctors, nurses and carers, but their other argument has been that using masks can have limited effect - and people struggle to use them effectively without training. Scarves, cotton home-made coverings that cover nose and mouth and other bought masks that are not ones used by the health service are fine. But experts have stressed that it does not stop the need for social distancing. Officials said that people can make coverings at home, but added that the key thing is it should cover your mouth and nose. The new advice is for the public to wear face coverings - not face masks - in certain settings. Official guidance says that this should be done in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and where people come into contact with others they do not normally meet. Such places include public transport and some shops. The change is because more people going to work increases the number of people each inidual is likely to come into contact with. Homemade cloth face-coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances.  But people should always wash their hands before and after and should wash them after use at a high temperature or dispose of them safelythey are not reusable. This is not intended to help the person wearing the covering but to protect against inadvertent transmission of the disease to othersyou have it asymptomatically.  Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said a face covering “could include a scarf, it could include a home-made cotton face covering, it could include face coverings you can buy in shops or online”. But he said people must “not, I stress not” use “the surgical medical or ones used in social care.  “Because it’s very important that PPE… is maintained for people in those professional environments.” And he stressed “this is not an alternative to social distancing” - people must still maintain a -metre gap where possible and stay at homethey have symptoms.  The governmentaposs document states that the public should not be wearing facemasks such as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers. These supplies must continue to be reserved for those who need it. Face-coverings should also not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly including younger children without assistance, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face-coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. Prof Whitty said: “We know that with this infection, people can have a period before they get symptoms where they can be infections. Probably two, possibly three days… From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty. Events in Parliament have rarely been so crucial - or confusing.

In his response to the Prime Ministeraposs broadcast on Sunday, Sir Keir said Labour would continue to work constructively with the Government in its response to the pandemic.At the same time, however, he made clear they would seek to hold ministers to account for their actions. Mr Johnson announced a widespread reform to the lockdown on Sunday. On Monday he revealed the stages in which it will be lted - with the Government saying some workers, in England, in construction, manufacturing and food production couldto work from Wednesdayworkplaces met safety standards. Mr Johnson has told MPs the Governmentaposs road map for lting the coronavirus lockdown will enable the country to control the diseasepeople continue to follow the rules. But Mr Starmer, who earlier told the House of Commons that Mr Johnsonaposs plan to ease Britainaposs lockdown raises lots of questions but contains precious few answers criticised the plan in his national broadcast, set to air this evening. He said: What we needed from the Prime Minister last night was clarity and reassurance, The Prime Minister said he was setting out a road map, butweaposre to complete the journey safely a road map needs clear directions. So many of us have questions that need answering. For as long as this crisis persists Iaposll keep demanding answers to these questions because thataposs how we get better decisions and better outcomes. I remain committed to working constructively with the Government in the national interest. Sir Keir said that as the country emerged from the crisis, there must be a collective effort to build a better society. After all this, all the sacrice and the loss, we canapost go back to business as usual, he said. When we get through this it will be because of the hard work and the bravery of every key worker as they took on this virus and kept our country going. In their courage and their sacrice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and the human spirit in all of us. We must go forward with a vision of a better society built Keir Starmeraposs speech in full We are living through the biggest threat this country has faced for a generation. Coronavirus has taken so much from us. It’s brought normal le to a halt. We can no longer see our friends, no longer spend time with extended family, and over , people have lost their lives. Behind these statistics are families torn apart by grief. Millions are worried about their loved ones, their jobs, their communities, their families and their future. That’s why when I was elected Leader of the Labour Party, just over a month ago, I promised a new type of opposition. Labour will always put the national interest first. We will have the courage to support the Government when that’s the right thing to do, and the courage to challenge the Government where it’s getting it wrong. Today I repeat that message. Labour has supported lockdown and we continue to do so. Public health and saving lives must always come first, whether we voted for this Government or not. At this moment of national crisis we all rely on the Government to get this right. That’s why we’ve called for a national consensus and offered to work with the Government to defeat this dreadful virus. What we needed from the Prime Minister last night was clarity and reassurance. We needed to hear that nobody would be asked to go to work or send their children to school without it being safe to do so. We needed to know that the huge problems weaposve seen with protective equipment are over. That the crisis in our care homes has finally been gripped. That everybody who needs a test can finally get one. Above all, we needed know when we could see our loved ones again. The Prime Minister said he was setting out a road map, butwe’re to complete the journey safely a roadmap needs clear directions. So many of us have questions that need answering. How can we be sure our workplaces are now safe toto  How can we get to work safelywe need public transport to do so  How can millions of people go back to work while balancing childcare and caring responsibilities  How do our police enforce these rules  And why are some parts of the United Kingdom now on a dferent path to others  For as long as this crisis persists I’ll keep demanding answers to these questions because that’s how we get better decisions and better outcomes.

The Prime Minister addressed the nation on Sunday night and published a -page document on Monday as the death toll increased to almost ,. Primary schools and non-essential shops will start to reopen from next month, and there is a plan for cafes and restaurants to start serving customers in July. But pubs and hairdressers face a long and uncertain wait before they can reopen. And Mr Johnson faces disagreements with leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland whose leaders have already heavily criticized the new aposstay alertapos messaging. Todayaposs advice applies to England - and while some of it is also true of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, a lot of it isnapost. These are the earliest possible dates and are subject to change depending upon the aposRaposrate andthat surges above the crucial number of one. A new Covid Alert System is being set up determined mainly by the reinfection rate and the number of cases. The alert levels will be one to five and the higher the level, the tougher social distancing measures will have to be. The PM said the UK had been in Level Four but we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. Wednesday  May: More outdoor time - but more peopleto work  England enters step one of easing lockdown. From May  people in England will be allowed to take unlimited outdoor exercise - but they must continue to follow social distancing guidelines. You can also sit in the park or on a beach, and sunbathe on your own or with members of the same household. You may also meet one person from one other household in public as long as you sit at least two metres away. This cannot be group of more than two. Golf courses, tennis courts and fishing lakes will reopen for people to play under these rules. And you can drive an unlimited distance to a beauty spot for some socially-distanced activity - as long as it doesnapost cross the Scottish or Welsh borders.  Meanwhile, Boris Johnson said people who canapost work from home will now be actively encouraged to go to work. This includes more than million people who work in construction and manufacturing. Along with food production, logistics, distribution, and scientic research in laboratories. Mr Johnson was not initially clear about the timing and unions thought it was from Monday  May. They warned his speech was a recipe for chaos - as vital guidelines on how firms should keep workers safe had not yet been published. Workers should avoid public transport, using private cars, walking or cycling where possible - despite many having no other option.If they do use public transport they should wear a face covering of some kind. Read the full list of changes from Wednesday here.  A -day quarantine is to be placed on all passengers arriving into the UK - aside from those coming France and the Republic of Ireland. This includes Brits ing from a foreign holiday - although, this is understood to be a low number as tens of thousands have already been repatriated by the Foreign Office at this point. All international arrivals, including by air and other modes of transport, must provide their contact and accommodation information. They will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app. Those not on a short list of exemptions will have to self-isolate in their accommodation for fourteen days on arrival into the UK. Where international travellers are unable to demonstrate where they would self-isolate, they will be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the Government.  England enters step two of easing lockdown - with primary schools and some non-essential shops set to reopen. Primary schools  will reopen for the first time since March  to all children - and not just those whose parents are key workers - from June  at the earliest. But it will be in phases with reception and years one and six going first, followed by other years in the following weeks - provided infections remain low. The government wants all primary school pupils to be back at school for at least a month before the summer holidays. Secondary schools will remain closed entirely until September apart from years  and , who are expected tofor some transition help with home schooling. Meanwhile, the first non-essential shops will start to reopen in phases from June . The exact order hasnapost been announced yet. Premier League matches are set to resume behind closed doors, along with other cultural events. And more public transport could be reopened in urban areas to cope with the increased flow of people. July: Some cafes and restaurants begin to reopen - but not pubs yet  England enters step three of easing the lockdown. The nation would re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. The roadmap says these include hairdressers, beauty salons, pubs, hotels, places of worship and cinemas. But the document makes clear not all of these will be able to reopen in July. It says: Some venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove dficult to enact distancing may still not be able to re-open safely at this point. And government sources warned pubs in particular will be dficult to reopen safely because people cram in together. The document also says it is likely that reopening beauty salons, nightclubs, sports stadiums, gyms and cinemas, for example, may only be fully possible signicantly later depending on the reduction in numbers of infections. August It is understood pubs will not be able to reopen in July. Even August could very well be too soon. The truth is there is simply not a date - but August appears to be the very, very earliest according to government sources. he British Beer  Pub Associationhas warned that up to % of Britainaposs pubs cannot survive beyond September with the current level of financial support being offered by the Government. It estimates that almost , pubs may not be able to reopen following the  coronavirus  crisis. September  Secondary school lessons to finally resume  - but classrooms may have dramatically changed by this point with less pupils per class or phased openings. By this stage the government hopes to have a better handle on how the lockdown lting measures are affecting the R rate. But this whole schedule could change Boris Johnson promised to put on the brakesCovid- cases show signs of increasing as lockdown measures are eased. In an effort to reassure a nervous public about adjusting to living with coronavirus, the Prime Minister insisted he would not do anything that would risk a second peak in infections. Under the test, track and trace programme - with the help of the new NHS Covid- app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight - officials hope to identy and isolate any new outbreaks before the infection gets out of control. In his address to the nation setting out a road map out of the lockdown, Mr Johnson saidthere are outbreaks,there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.

Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs second major announcement, which aired last night, gave updated guidance as the government shared the plan for getting the UK moving again. Some of the rules have been relaxed and there is a vague new motto replacing the aposStay Homeapos message - Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives. However the changes have left many Brits even more confused by the new information, which addresses going back to work, schools and socialising. A new -word document gave us a clearer breakdown of the new rules, but lots of you still have a lot of questions. While we donapost know the answers to all of the questions yet, weaposve done our best and have brought together all the information we have so far. When can family members come over to my house  Iaposm afraid we donapost know, a date hasnapost been given yet. The rule that you canapost go to another personaposs house still applies, so you canapost pop over to your mumaposs house for a cuppa - evenyou socially distance when youaposre there. However, you can see them. You can meet one other person from another household in a public place - but you must socially distance. So you, alone, can meet one friend or family member and sit in the park or on the beach, however you canapost be in a group of more than two.  The government is looking at a new bubble system, which could come into force later this year. Under the idea based on New Zealand, one household would be able to join up with another household to form one unit. But youaposd have to choose just one household to pair with - and not see anyone . This change is not confirmed and there is no date when it might happen. When can I see my partner who lives in a dferent household  As above, you canapost go to your boyfriend or girlfriendaposs house but you can meet them in a public place. However the m rule still applies - which means you canapost give them a cuddle or a kiss. This obviously isnapost the answer anybody wanted, and itaposs obviously extremely dficult for people living apart from their partner. We donapost have a date for when people will be able to go to each otheraposs houses. Dropping that m distance seems to be one of the later things in the governmentaposs plans. How long does  per cent furlough last  At the moment, itaposs guaranteed until the end of June. We donapost know exactly what will happen beyond that, however it looks like itaposs going to be phased out slowly. There is a chance that the amount of support will be cut down from  per cent to  per cent. Another thing thataposs been hinted at is that it might go sector by sector, with businesses that are allowed to reopen - like shops - losing it before pubs, who will remain closed for longer.  The rumour is that weaposll have an announcement on the furlough scheme tomorrow . If you can sit in the park m away from strangers, why can you not sit m away from both your parents  It has to be just one of you, and one other person. No more than two, regardless of households. It seems the government have put this rule in place to make it clear what the rules are and to have a clear boundary. Otherwise, we could end up with big groups from dferent households. It perhaps doesnapost follow logic for everyone, but they are the rules that have been put in place. Is it the same rule for all of the UK  No. Itaposs dferent for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The main changes we are reporting are for England. Why have Reception, Year  Year  been picked to go back to school first  For Year , there is a clear logic there because they are waiting to go off to secondary schools. They want to see their friends one last time and to have some sort of transition. For younger children, it seems to be based on the fact the virus is less harmful the younger you go. The risk to four-year-olds is very low. Also, younger children have very high childcare requirements, which has put a huge strain on parents working from home. Older children on the other hand can be left for longer. Will I be finedI donapost want to send my children back to school yet  No. Downing Street has confirmed  that parents who donapost feel comfortable sending their children back to school wonapost face a financial punishment. A spokesman said: Whilst we will not penalise for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so. When will weddings be allowed to go ahead  Ministers are giving some anxious consideration to weddings. Itaposs likely that some more urgent ceremonies - for example, those taking place in hospitals - may be allowed to go ahead. However, when it comes to typical weddings - with hundreds of guests, dancing and booze - the wait will be longer. A huge party obviously involves a lot of people which makes social distancing very dficult. There is no date on this yet. When will pubs be open  Weaposre not going to get to sit in the pub with a pint for a long time. It looks like they will be in the final wave of businesses to reopen as the lockdown eases in several phases. That means we do not have a set date for when they will open their doors. While some venues - such as cinemas, cafes and places of worship - may be able to open in July , itaposs not thought that pubs will be allowed to open until later in the year.  And Downing Street has made it clear any dates could still be pushed back. This is because each phase will only go aheadthe scientic advice suggests coronavirus is not spiking up again in the UK. Will I be finedI donapost send my children back to school in June  We havenapost been given a guarantee but it looks like authorities arenapost wanting to go hard on nervous parents. Not all school children are going back at the same time. Secondary school pupils wonapost go back before September. The government hasnapost guaranteed that people wonapost be fined, but looking realistically at this I think theyaposre trying to coax people back into school I think it would be a very unwise authority to fine parents for not sending children back in the first few weeks. Any news on when gyms and swimming pools could reopen  There isnapost a plan for these sorts of establishments yet. As far as we know, theyaposre not in the wave of places that could open in July at the earliest.  A gym is somewhere you have a lot of close contact with people, and a lot of shared machines, which could make it higher risk. If Iaposm shielding do the same rules as before apply  Could it be extended  Yes. The rules on .million very vulnerable people whoaposve been told by letter or phone call to stay at home completely for  weeks still apply despite the changes to the lockdown rules. It may seem terribly unfair, but the rules are there because these people are at extreme risk from Covid-. We donapost knowthe shielding time could be extended. Ministers have said it might have to be extended, but we donapost know for sure yet. Do the new lockdown rules apply to the over s  When lockdown was introduced, over s were advised to stay at home as much as possible. However the Government has recognised that not everyone in a particular category has the same needs - and so may be able to be exposed to more risk or need to take more precautions. The advice now says that the over-s should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households - but lockdown will be eased for them just like most other people. When can I go and visit my mum in her care home  It doesnapost look like this is going to be for a long time, which we understand is very upsetting news for many people. Visits to regular homes still isnapost allowed, and care homes have much higher risk due to the age and medical conditions of residents. As we know, the death rates in care homes has been tragically high, and staff are doing everything they can to protect people. At the moment we donapost know when care home visits will be allowed, and itaposs likely that when the rules are changed it will be at the discretion of the care homes. When will dentists reopen  We donapost have an update on this at the moment, but hopefully there will be some guidance soon. Lots of people are desperately in need of dental treatment.  But so far, weaposve not had anything. Do you think the government will provide face masks  People now have to wear a face-covering on public transport and in other places were social distancing is not always possible - including shops. A face covering is not a surgical mask or respirator which must be reserved for healthcare workers.  It can be homemade or a scarf or other piece of material to cover the mouth and do not protect the wearer as much as the people around them However, itaposs very unlikely that the government will send them out. Itaposs likely that we will be asked to wear a face covering, rather than a medical mask. There is a huge shortage of PPE at the moment, and sending masks out to people will simply take them away from NHS workers who need them more. There are thee types of mask:A full surgical covering, which are used in hospitals. They are expensive The paper medical masks, which offer some coverage A face covering, which you can make at home using an old t-shirt or a scarf.How far can we travel  There is not a restriction on how far we can travel, but you have to travel to take exercise somewhere. If youaposre driving to the beach or to go for a walk, thataposs fine. If youaposre driving miles to your auntaposs house, that isnapost allowed. Can kids take public transport to school  The guidance is to take a car or cycleyou can, however this isnapost possible for many families.  Therefore you can take public transportyou have no other option. However, this isnapost going to be easy as social distancing means far few people will be allowed on each bus or train. Itaposs an ongoing discussion and weaposll be hearing a lot more about the logistics in the next few weeks. When can Years , ,    go back to school  If all goes well, they should be able to go back at the end of June or July. The idea is that Reception, Year  and Year  pupils will go back earlier and the others will follow a few weeks later - before the summer holidays.

Previously the government had said people should only go to workyou must -youaposre an essential worker. But it is now changing the emphasis of the advice so that anyone who cannot work from home is being actively encouraged toto work from Wednesday. This includes people who work in construction or manufacturing, or other fields where remote working is not an option.  People are still, however, being urged to avoid public transport wherever possible, and drive, walk or cycle to work instead. Social distancing measures should be followed in the workplace to ensure that employees remain at a safe distance from each other. The details are unclear but are expected to be fleshed out in a  page guidance document at pm today. Mr Johnson didnapost specyit was UK or just England... but Nicola Sturgeon made clear Scotland werenapost being asked to come back to work In his speech last night, Mr Johnson also just said the rules would change this week which most viewers took to mean Monday. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has this morning claried it kicks in from Wednesday. You can still only send your children to schoolyou are a key worker - so it is unclear what happens with childcare to people being asked toto work. There has been much criticism of Johnsonaposs decision to encourage people toto work so suddenly. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the PM appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work tomorrow without the necessary guidance. He added: We havenapost got the guidelines, and we donapost know how itaposs going to work with public transport so thereaposs a huge number of questions arising out of this. John Phillips, acting GMB General Secretary, pointed out that many people don’t have the luxury of being able to avoid public transport. He said: Employers who now see a green light to operate will expect their employees to come in - what happensthey can’t do so without public transport  “Given workplace standards haven’t been published yet, how are employers supposed to know what to do to make workplaces safe  We all want to get back to normal but we have to think of this in terms of the real lives and challenge of the people who will be asked to go to work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"amazing offer new gaming website","story":"AdvertorialAmazing offer from new gaming website which is raising thousands of pounds for charitiesHealth Games is matching a generous % of players first deposits and donating that sum to charityShareByDave Masters:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThe pledge applies to all first deposits\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Face masks were only mandatory for those working on the front line, as they can help protect others. However, all this is about to change. This morning, Transport for London has urged passengers to wear face coverings on public transport to help stop the spread of Covid- as some begin ing to work as per new lockdown rules. And the government has now also advised that face coverings in enclosed public spaces where you may be more likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as in shops. Face coverings do not need to be worn outdoors, while exercising, in schools, in workplaces such as offices, and retail, or by those who may find them dficult to wear, such as children under two or primary aged children who cannot use them without assistance, or those who may have problems breathing whilst wearing a face covering. The public is also being strongly urged not to purchase surgical masks or respirators, which are prioritised for healthcare workers.Instead you should use scarves or have a go at making your own at home.A post on Gov.uk further states: A cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. It can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head. Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off and after use. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them. You should wash a face covering regularly. It can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent. They then shared a simple method to make your own face mask at home - and you only need one item, a t-shirt. Hereaposs how to make it:Step : Cut a straight line across the width of the T-shirtapproximately cm from the bottom of the T-shirt. Step : From a point cm below the top right-hand corner of the fabric, make a cm horizontal cut through both sides of the fabric that is parallel to the top of the rectangle. Step : Cut down towards the bottom of the fabric until you reach approximately cm above the bottom edge. From here, make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom of the fabric to make a rectangle that can be discarded. Step : To make the ties, cut open the edge of the  long strips of fabric. Unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and the nose. The  strips act as ties to hold the cloth face covering in place and should be tied behind the head and around the neck.  If youaposre good at sewing, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionin the US have also shared a slightly more complicated way of making your own face mask. To do this you will need fabric, pieces of elasticplus a needle and thread or sewing machine. Hereaposs the method according to CDC: .  Cut out two -by--inch rectangles of cotton fabric. Use tightly woven cotton, such as quilting fabric or cotton sheets. T-shirt fabric will work in a pinch. Stack the two rectangles you will sew the mask asit was a single piece of fabric.  .  Fold over the long sides ¼ inch and hem. Then fold the double layer of fabric over ½ inch along the short sides and stitch down. .  Run a -inchof  -inch wide elastic through the wider hem on each side of the mask. These will be the ear loops. Use a large needle or a bobby pin to thread it through. Tie the ends tight. Don’t have elastic  Use hair ties or elastic head bands. If you only have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the mask behind your head.

Labour and teaching unions say the Government has not reassured parents, teachers or children they will be safe. And hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a choice about when their children shouldto school. Lucy Browne, , who has a five-year-old daughter in a reception class, started the appeal on Change.org last Tuesday. She said: “As a mum, I don’t want to face serious repercussions for making a choice I feel affects the safety of my daughter during a global pandemic.” Less than , had put their names to the appeal before PM Johnson addressed the nation about his plans on Sunday evening. But within moments of him finishing, tens of thousands began signing. And by yesterday evening, the total was more than ,. Lucy, from South East London, said she was “overwhelmed” by the response. “After the announcement by Boris Johnson, that was when it went crazy. It was going up in thousands every few seconds” she said.  “I suppose I felt strongly about something and I just wanted my voice to be heard. I’m a concerned parent and I started it thinking of my own reasons. “But I was also thinking there are probably a lot of people who felt the same. I’m not saying ‘keep the schools closed’, I’m just saying ‘give people the choice’.” She added: “I hope the Government does listen because nearly half a million people have signed it. “There are hundreds of thousands of parents out there who are worried about this because they are not confident about sending their children back.” Under the PM’s plan, parents will not be fined for keeping their children at home, but will be “strongly encouraged” to send them in.  Teachers who are shielding would be required to work from home, while those considered vulnerable, but not shielding, would be asked to work in offices away from pupils. Parent Deborah Mawer, who signed Lucy’s petition, wrote: “I have a child with asthma and have asthma myself, and would not feel safe sending them out to potentially then have us both very, very ill.”Schools, colleges and nurseries closed seven weeks ago due to the coronavirus outbreak, remaining open only for vulnerable youngsters and the children of key workers.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, called the plan for a June to the classroom “irresponsible” and “reckless”. He questioned how teachers could adhere to social-distancing measures in classes of  or more pupils. And he said testing should be available for both students and teachers, alongside plans for what schools should doa pupil or faculty member falls ill with Covid-.  He said: “We’ve said they need a plan forthere’s a case in the school. “What do you then do  Do you close the whole class down  Do you close the whole school down  “We’ve been given no science on that. How can we be planning now when they haven’t given us any of those things.” Fellow joint general secretary Mary Bousted said: “Parents are quite rightly concerned about the risks to their children, not just at school but on their journeys to and from school. “This, in turn, threatens the safety of adults in the school community – parents, families, teachers, heads and support staff.” A poll by Mumsnet found most parents would not send their children back to school as soon as they reopen.

Earlier today official guidance was finally released clarying that people are now advised to cover their faces when out and about. Everyone aside from babies and toddlers, and those who find it dficult to wear face coverings, should now wear them in public spaces. The government guidance states: “If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. “A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers these supplies should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. “Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary school age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.” This afternoon Prime Minister Boris Johnson claried that members of the public would not be forced to wear face coverings. Asked about Londoners being told to wear face coverings on buses, trains and Tubes by transport bosses in the capital, the PM said people cannot be forced. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: “We’re certainly not compelling people to wear face coverings.” However he said they were helpful to protect others as the coronavirus is passed through air droplets.  The Prime Minister tried to emphasis that the lockdown is far from over during a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon. He said: “We have begun our descent from the peak of the pandemic but our journey has reached the most perilous moment.” Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home.

Newly-released guidance says the government wants to reopen some non-essential shops from June  at the earliest, though not those that require close contact with customers.Then at least some of the other businesses that were shut in March would begin to open from July  at the earliest. The roadmap says these include hairdressers, beauty salons, pubs, hotels, places of worship and cinemas.But the document clearly warns that the reopening could be pushed backfears over the spread of coronavirus reemerge. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Hair salons will need to adhere to strict  two-metre social distancing rules and it is likely that some will have to rule out walk-in appointments as in Europe.The details come in Our Plan to Rebuild: The UK Governmentaposs Covid  recovery strategy which sets out the three-phase approach starting this week. The document says: Some venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove dficult to enact distancing may still not be able to re-open safely at this point. The document also says it is likely that reopening beauty salons, nightclubs, sports stadiums, gyms and cinemas, for example, may only be fully possible signicantly later depending on the reduction in numbers of infections.  And government sources warned pubs in particular will be dficult to reopen safely because people cram in together. Writing the forward, Mr Johnson says: It is not a quickto aposnormality.apos Nor does it lay out an easy answer. And, inevitably, parts of this plan will adapt as we learn more about the virus. But it is a plan that should give the people of the United Kingdom hope. It is clear that the only feasible long-term solution lies with a vaccine or drug-based treatment.  Mr Johnson is outlining the plan in detail to MPs this afternoon.But changes to the global economy mean we will notto normal after the Covid- peak has passed. Other European countries have announced their rules on reopening salons with many nations demanding appointments be booked in advance. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart.

The blackmailer threatened to release videos and images of the sexual encounter to the media unless the tycoon handed over cash. Westminster Magistratesapos Court heard the father was a businessman of public standing while his son was somebody who struggles with their gender identity and sexuality. Julie Idowu, prosecuting, said both were well-known public figures, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Jack Gibson, , is accused of blackmailing both father and son.  He was arrested at the Sidney Hotel near Victoria Station in central London on April . Ms Idowu said: Complainant number two is a businessman of public standing. The other complainant is somebody who struggles with their gender identity and sexuality. She said Gibson had videos and pictures of the son he had taken throughout the night in his flat after they had intercourse on two separate occasions. The defendant had been in talks with the media to release the videos and pictures which seemed to be concerning matters that occurred in private. He was found at a hotel when he was arrested. Heaposs already been in negotiations with the press about releasing the bits of evidence he had. He has referred to backing up the evidence. He still has these pieces of evidence to use to blackmail the witnesses in this case. His intention is still to release these to the press.

As Chief Nursing Officer for England Ruth May offered her thanks to her “incredible staff”, we speak to nurses around the country who tell of battling the virus... Stuart Tuckwood Critical care nurse Stuart, , from London, has been nursing for six years and moved to work in intensive care during the pandemic. He was inspired to become a nurse after working as a carer and seeing the huge dference his nursing colleagues made. He is now the national officer for nursing at the union UNISON.  Stuart says: “I have to pay tribute to my intensive care colleagues who not only have been treating patients at their sickest but also overseeing the work of nurses like myself who have just stepped intotheir departments.“It is incredibly challenging, skilful work. I’ve had to learn new skills, in an intense environment and you can be wearing PPE all night, which is hard. “I have looked after some patients who are awake and on oxygen, and we are trying to keep them off the ventilators.  “It is scary for them as they are struggling to breathe, and it’s emotionally draining for the nurses having to care for them and keep in touch with their families. I did a sht on another ward last week where people recovering from the virus were being treated. “It was so rewarding to see how our work has helped them to get better.” Zoe Carciente AE nurse  Zoe is one of the thousands of nurses who have joined the profession on the front line of the NHS, weeks before properly qualying. But in the AE department of her local North West Lon­­don hospital, -year-old Zoe is a full team member. She says: “My le changed so rapidly but nursing is what I want to do and I’m not one to panic, so just threw myself into the job.  For students like myself, this is what we came into it for.” The mother of two, who retrained as a nurse after her children became more independent, says that nursing is in her blood. “My mother used to work as an ITU nurse and it was just something I wanted to do myself. “It has been a daunting time but the staff have been so hugely supportive of us.” Katie Kearns Ward Sister Katie, , is in charge of the first ward atthe Royal Marsden Hospital in London to treat Covid- patients.Katie, who has been nursing for eight years, says: “It was daunting at first. The main thing was that my staff were scared and I wanted to reassure them that they would be protected by the hospital, the Trust and the NHS.  I have three newly qualied nurses so I was very aware that they were junior in their careers. “But sometimes they have really been the ­backbone and they have been incredible. “I have always made sure that my staff are looking after themselves as well. “It is dficult when patients get very sick.  For those who have been very poorly and may not live, we have in exceptional cases let a family member come and say their goodbyes and leave.” Katie appreciates the public support, saying: “It really makes you proud of what you do. I love going past people’s houses and seeing the pictures that children have drawn in the windows.” Beth Kimber Head of infection prevention  Beth, , works for Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust and has been instrumental in setting up the area’s ­swabbing and testing regime. She and colleagues have also been testing in care homes. She says: “The residents are high risk but they aren’t scared.” "},{"url":null,"title":"interpol issue red notice diplomat","story":"NewsInterpol issue red notice for US diplomat accused of hit-and-run death of British teen Harry DunnNorthamptonshire Police told the parents of -year-old Harry Dunn that Anne Sacoolas, who has been charged with causing his death, is now subject to an Interpol Red NoticeShareByOliver MilnePolitical CorrespondentMatthew Dresch:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video car-seen-on-wrong-side-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news interpol-issue-red-notice-diplomat-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In an email sent by Northamptonshire Police, the -year-oldaposs parents were told the suspect is wanted internationally and should she leave the USA the wanted circulations should be enacted. The Prime Ministeraposs Official Spokesman said: Our position remains that the US decision not to extradite Anne Sarcoolas is a denial of justice. We have made this case repeatedly to the UK, including the Prime Minister directly to President Trump. Ms Sarcoolas shouldto the UK to face justice. Downing Street would not confirm that it was behind the request to issue the notice for Ms Sarcoolas.  This means Sacoolas can be arrestedshe sets foot outside the United States. It comes after the head of the British armed forces told Harryaposs family that he will make representations to his US colleagues about setting up a meeting after claims of near misses involving American military staff. General Sir Nick Carter has penned a letter to Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn promising to raise the matter - saying I am very supportive of positive engagement between you and the US base commander. His words come after an initial plea from the parents to arrange a meeting with the base following claims of three near misses involving their staff since Harryaposs death.  Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn told General Carter that they bear our American friends no ill will, but insisted RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire could not practise splendid isolation on safety issues. Senior US officials previously refused a meeting with the Dunn family, due to their intention to sue the American Government. Deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in London, Yael Lempert, told the familyaposs MP Andrea Leadsom that it would not be appropriate to meet with the family given the strong interest of both countries to ensure proper judicial review. Harry, , was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car outside the US military base on August  last year.  His alleged killer Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able toto her home country, sparking an international controversy. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December, but an extradition request submitted by the Home Office for Mrs Sacoolas was rejected by the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January. In General Carteraposs letter to the parents, seen by the PA news agency, he said: Although the US Base Commander has some autonomy, she reports through her US chain of command to the Department for Defence on matters such as requests for local meetings.

Schools nationwide have been shut since the start of the lockdown on March  but in his address to the nation yesterday evening Boris Johnson confirmed steps are being made to reopen them. Primary schools could begin to be reopened to all children from June  after the half term but it will be phased, Mr Johnson warned, beginning with reception, Year  and Year  who will be back in school in smaller sizes. Secondary school pupils and further education colleges in England will not resume lessons at all before the summer, it is understood.

But the Prime Minister’s call came as figures showed working-class men have the greatest risk of dying from Covid- – sparking fears the lowest-paid could be forced to put themselves in harm’s way to reboot the economy. And despite his efforts to inspire confidence over the route out of lockdown, the Government continued to face accusations of mixed messaging. Mr Johnson said in the Commons employers must “look after workers” and be “Covid-secure, Covid-compliant”. He told MPs: “Anyone who cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work and sectors allowed to be open should indeed be open but subject to social distancing.” Getting us back to work is a key part of the Covid- Recovery Strategy, in which the Business Department gave guidance for eight settings – including factories, offices and call centres. But the Office for National Statistics said security guards, taxi drivers, carers, bus drivers, chefs and retail assistants have higher death rates involving Covid- than other workers. And as the UK death toll rose by  yesterday to hit ,, union leaders warned of an unacceptable risk to stafftheyto the front line with the pandemic still raging. Unite demanded a public inquiry into “why low-paid workers appear to be at most risk of dying from Covid-”. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “There has to be a safeto work. This guidance should’ve come much sooner. People are bewildered by the confusing and often conflicting messages from Government. We’ve got to get this right. If we don’t, more lives will be lost and there’ll be a second spike.”  RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “This is the Government making it up as they go along in the middle of a pandemic. It’s a shambles and it’s my members in the transport sector whose lives are on the line. The wholeto work policy should be put on hold until safety can be guaranteed.” No’s blueprint to ease the lockdown recommends wearing face coverings on public transport and in some shops – but they will not be compulsory. Advice for offices includes using tape or paint to keep workers two metres apart and erecting screens. For businesses offering takeaways, guidance includes kitchen workstations two metres apart and asking customers to wait in cars. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the safety guidelines “are a step in the right direction”. She added: “People will only feel confidentGovernment and employers act now to make safer working a reality. Getting this right is in the national interest. If rogue employers cut corners it puts us all at risk of another spike and Government must get to grips with the ongoing crisis in PPE as more workers start to require it.” The roadmap also outlines dates on which parts of normal le could resume in England – but Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own plans.  Non-essential shops will not open until June  at earliest and onlybosses can prove they can keep customers and staff safe. Hairdressers, cafes and restaurants will stay closed until at least July , as will places of worship. Businesses trading again yesterday included garden centres and coffee shops, including  Pret a Manger sites. The PM said keeping the “R” rate – the virus spread – below one would help decide the timetable. He said: “Our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous, so at this stage we can go no further than the first careful modications of our measures.” But he continued to face accusations of muddled messaging. No said on Sunday some changes would take effect for employees ing to work from Monday. Yet when Mr Johnson made his TV address, he failed to spell out when the shake-up would come into force. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday gave conflicting messages on social distancing and s to work. He said rules would be in force from Wednesday, sparking confusion on why the PM announced them on Sunday. Labour leader Keir Starmer told the Commons: “What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and both are in pretty short supply.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen urges royals step up","story":"NewsQueen urges other royals to step up to public duties during coronavirus crisisEXCLUSIVE: The Queen has made it clear that ones duty is toto public le and the family must have a united front to help the nation heal when the crisis is overShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-praises-british-love-care-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news queen-urges-royals-step-up-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Senior aides have created a programme dubbed the Royal Task Force aimed at extending The Firm’s public presence. Prince Edward, , and we Sophie, , will take on more duties while the Queen self-isolates. Royal sources have confirmed that the monarch is “more determined than ever towhen the time is right”. But in the meantime she is said to be in constant contact with Prince Charles and Prince William. She has told them that the family “must have a united front” to help the country heal when the crisis is over, sources have confirmed. Since Prince Harry, , and Meghan, , quit their royal roles to move to the US, the family have been working to ensure charities that rely on royal support are taken care of. William, , and Kate, , have been at the forefront of the plan. They have held regular Zoom calls with frontline NHS workers, school staff and pupils of key workers and ious charities. The couple also spoke to Second World War veterans ahead of the th anniversary of VE Day last week. A royal source said: “There is going to be a lot more interaction between the family members while the crisis is ongoing.  “Her Majesty has given instructions that, after a turbulent period for the family last year, now is the time to heal and have a united front and get back to the basics of what the monarchy is for – her sole belief is that it goes back to the basics of duty.” Prince Charles, , Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have opened, via video link, the emergency NHS Nightingale Hospitals in recent weeks. The Countess has been seen more than ever during the crisis, offering tips to other parents on Instagram to help boost morale.  She has also used the  to promote charities and urge people to reach out for help when they need it amid the lockdown. Sophie has helped to publicise advice from the children’s charity NSPCC and the National Autistic Society. Insiders speak of her “natural charm” and “genuine warmth”.  A palace source added: “She is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. She’s incredibly hard working, no nonsense and she really cares about people and the causes she works on. The public has seen that as well and through the crisis she has been seen more and more. That can only be a good thing for everyone involved.” Prince William, meanwhile, has announced a new fund from the National Emergencies Trust’s coronavirus appeal, which has already distributed nearly £milllion to those who are struggling. The fund helps to provide vital supplies and support to those in need. Kate has launched a project called Hold Still in conjunction with the National Portrait Gallery, asking people to send in personal images of the pandemic.

Under step two - to be made no earlier than June  - it says officials are examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings. But it says places of worship could be closed until July  at the earliest, dependent on whether they can adequately enforce social distancing measures. All social events, including weddings but excluding funerals, were halted when the Government announced lockdown measures on March . Before this, the Church of England restricted weddings during the outbreak to a maximum of five people, including the bride and groom.  Giving details on step two of the plan, officials said they are considering a range of options to reduce the most harmful social effects of the lockdown.

The next step is to run some hotwater in the sink and then put your brush or brushes into the water to soak. Mrs Hinch, real name Sophie Hinchclfe, then adds one tablespoon of washing up liquid and one tablespoon of white vinegar to the water. The mum-of-one says the vinegar helps to remove bacteria and germs. Allow the brushes to sit in the water mixture for at least an hour.

She works at Karabanovo Town Hospital where staff have to wear the same masks multiple times because of extreme PPE shortage, local media has reported. Before being reused, the masks are disinfected with chlorine-based bleach.  According to Olga, her skin was damaged by poisonous chemicals that remained on her mask after the disinfection. She told local media: aposaposSingle-use masks and hazmat suits are being washed with chlorine-based bleach and given to the hospital staff for further usage. aposaposOne hour after my sht began, I felt a burning sensation on my face. Because of rules, I could not take the mask off and had to endure throughout my working hours. aposaposAfter my sht ended, I took off the mask and saw my injured face.aposapos Olga told the hospital administration about the incident and asked for medical help but was sent home instead, she claimed. She said: aposaposThe next morning my condition worsened and I went to a traumatologist. He examined me and diagnosed with second-degree chemical burns. aposaposSeveral hours later I started having dficulty breathing and developed severe and painful face swelling. My parents took me to Moscow where I was admitted to a burn centre. aposaposIt was not an isolated incident. My orderly suffered burns as well. These masks must be disposable.aposapos Emmanuil Zdanovsky, who runs the hospital, denied the usage of bleach to sanitise masks.  Speaking to local media, he said: aposaposWe do not use bleach to sterilise masks and protective gowns.aposapos However, law enforcement confirmed the opposite and found numerous violations after checking the medical facility. A statement from the local prosecutoraposs office said: aposaposThe health authorities of the region and the hospital administration failed to secure enough masks and hazmat suits for the hospital staff.apos Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart.

I think that’s why they took to him right away.“I am delighted for him, he’s still very fit and he’ll be looking to add to the games he has played for this football club.“I know he still believes there is a lot more football in Paul McGowan and I think he’s had another excellent season.”The duo arrived at Dens as players in the summer of  and became fast friends, driving up to Dundee from Glasgow every day.Now McGowan’s boss, McPake admits their relationship has changed somewhat from the days when he’d be on the receiving end of a regular verbal volley on the park.“If there were three people around him then he would still take the ball,” McPake added.“That’s brave –people talk about centre-backs being brave because they’ll put their head where it hurts but Paul McGowan is brave because he’ll take the ball in tight spaces and work something.“He very rarely loses the ball, gets you fouls and there is a respect from other teams to him. I’ve found that as a manager, the amount of times I heard ‘McGowan’s a good player’ from other managers last season.“He was great to play with, he would always take it – he could be a pain when you didn’t give him it and the game is going on up the pitch but he’s still standing trying to argue with you!“That’s Gowser. But there’s more than a screamer or a shouter – he encourages people, he helps people out and he’s honest. He’s the first to put his hand up when he believes he’s done something wrong and that’s gone in the modern game. He sets such high standards.“He’s a voice in the dressing-room as well. I’ve played with him but it’s a completely dferent relationship now.#I was his team-mate and his mate but now we don’t see much of each other apart from on the training ground. The dynamics have changed but I know exactly what I’ll get from him whenever he’s on the pitch.“There have been a few times when I’ve thought ‘I’m glad I’ve got Paul McGowan’. Evenhe’s not played you might think there will be a problem, not playing against United or Aberdeen, but he just accepts it and goes and trains.“There’s no sulking and is great to work with. He was great to play with because he’s such a quality footballer and I’m glad I have him at my disposal as a manager. He’s a leader for our club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/Lindsey-Thompson-423x564.jpg ","title":"tayside family mark ve day with a 40s style lockdown garden party","story":"A Tayside family has marked the th anniversary of VE Day by creating a s-themed party in their garden.On Friday, May  families up and down the UK stopped to remember the end of the Second World War.But Lindsey and Dean Thompson and their eight-year-old daughter Kaitlin from Perth went one step further and transformed their garden with homemade bunting, a traditional afternoon tea, and a Skype call with Lindsey’s grandfather to hear his memories of VE Day in .Mum Lindsey said: “We decorated our front window with a soldier and poppies for passers-by to see, we learned how to dance the Charleston stroll and dressed up in #s clothes, and my daughter decorated some bunting and made paper chains.“After the minute’s silence we had an afternoon tea.“We also Skyped my grandad, Jim Warren, who was -years-old on VE Day and is in the British Legion.“He got dressed up with his medals and Kaitlin was able to learn about what he did during the war and on that day.Lindsey continued: “I think I wanted to do this because of my grandad.“Because he is in the British Legion he would normally have gone to a big ceremony and we had been due to go and see him over Easter and we didn’t get to go.“I have been feeling a bit disconnected to him because he was a big part of my le as a kid.#Lindsey also works as a PE teacher at Oakbank Primary School and set the pupils the task of learning the Charleston dance at home so they could mark VE Day themselves.Lindsey is shielding and has not been able to leave her house since  lockdown started, so she said she was pleased to be able to celebrate the day properly.She continued: “I have not been out at all, so it was nice to do this sort of thing to make the time not so tedious.“I can’t go out on walks just now and I have a lot of time on my hands.“We wanted to make a big thing out of VE Day for Kaitlin and make it real for her and show her it is not just something to read about in a book.“I also want her to have a good experience in lockdown and, rather than thinking of this as a time when we were all stuck inside, she will have good memories of this very strange situation.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"george-square-sauchiehall-street-seven-glasgow-landmarks-years","story":"WE love a throwback as much as anyone and what better way to get your fix than by seeing how our brilliant city has changed over the years."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph.

This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

Almost everyone abides by the coronavirus code, which carries an echo of the police speed awareness course I was once obliged to attend. ldquoOnly a fool ignores the two second rule,\" went the jingle for keeping your distance from the vehicle in front. Breaking the new rules could be even more hazardous.Everyone extols the virtues of regular walking, and to judge by peoplersquos faces and mood, itrsquos doing us good. Therersquos nothing like having your liberty taken to encourage you to get outdoors while you can. A favourite walk follows an old drove road, along which herders would drive their beasts to market, either locally or in the north of England. Wide, and partially cobbled, this route allows you to get into a stride, while scanning trees and sky, or field upon field of horses and their winter foals.A drove road like this could be as old as the village, or even older. Hoolet was officially granted permission to hold a market in the early s, so itrsquos possible that from miles around people traded their animals to and from here along tracks such as this. One of the commonest books yoursquoll find in second-hand book shops is A R B Haldanersquos The Drove Roads of Scotland.Regrettably I have lost my fatherrsquos copy, but have a sellotaped edition of my husbandrsquos. First published in , it looks off-puttingly dry and yet it offers a riveting insight into a way of le so long gone as to feel mythical. By way of research, Haldane spoke to shepherds, farmers, crofters and factors to mine them for local knowledge. The result is a testament to the part livestock and their keepers have played in our history.A colourful passage from a Victorian onlooker describes a livestock ldquotryst at Stenhousemuir, where around , sheep and tens of thousands of cattle were gathered. He writes of the tar pots used to mark sold beasts, the cacophony of cattle dealers, drovers, pedlars, gamblers, ballad singers and beggars, and of servants ldquorunning about shouting to the cattle, keeping them together in their particular lots and ever and anon cudgels are at work upon the horns and rumps of the restless animals that attempt to wander in search of grass or water. Such a welter of beasts recalls the great buffalo herds in the American mid-west, and the drama, and danger, of keeping them under control.Did such a multitude of hooves ever thunder past the village  The old track is so tranquil, despite the orchestration of birds, itrsquos hard to imagine its former use. But I find that is the case with almost everything about country le. Books, newspapers and documentaries constantly inform us about tempting rural walks we can take for our health and pleasure, and walking during lockdown has enjoyed a resurgence in the same way as biking. Yet well into the th century people from a hamlet like ours, and all across the country, walked for miles every day: not as a hobby or to keep fit, but because it was their only means of transport.The picturesque village of Denholm, not far away, is the birthplace of the famous linguist John Leyden. As a young man he once walked  miles in a day, just to record the final verses of a song to add to Sir Walter Scottrsquos compendium of border ballads. The shepherd James Hogg would think nothing of crossing the hills of an evening from the Ettrick valley to Tibbie Shielsrsquo Inn by St Maryrsquos Loch, to carouse with friends. Itrsquos a round trip of over  miles. When his household needed provisions from Selkirk, the nearest town, that would entail another -mile jaunt. Presumably a mule or pony was used for such a distance  But even for the four-legged, that is quite a schlepp.Another legendary walker was Thomas de Quincey, a forerunner of the redoubtable Captain Tom Moore. In the s he planned to cure himself of his ldquoopium misery by walking himself fit, but at this precise moment his legs failed him. His doctorrsquos warnings were dire and, fearing thathe didnrsquot cure himself he would be disabled for the rest of his le, he took to the garden of his cottage near Lasswade. Measuring its perimeter, he estimated  laps came to a mile. Starting out cautiously, he gradually grew stronger. Soon he was doing  or  miles a day until, he wrote, ldquoI had within ninety days walked  miles\". While he lived here, his medical student lodger trudged seven miles to Edinburgh University and back every day, so commonplace an occurrence it was barely worth remarking on.Itrsquos easy to look back on the great distances country folk covered with pity as well as awe, but as any serious walker knows, few things are more enjoyable ndash in decent weather ndash than clocking up the miles. There are moments when you feel like a piece of machinery, the cogs and wheels working in unison. Itrsquos also a failsafe way of clearing the mind, and finding fresh inspiration. Whenever my husband is stuck for the next sentence, he heads out. The top of every article or chapter he writes should record the tally of miles walked between first word and last.Itrsquos no wonder so many writers have been walkers. Not all were obliged to tramp the hills and roadside every day but many, like Robert Louis Stevenson, recognised the therapeutic benefits. He didnrsquot want to scale the heights, or keep to a strict and demanding schedule. A steady pace was his aim because, ldquoonce you have fallen into an equable stride, it requires no conscious thought from you to keep it up, yet it prevents you from thinking earnestly of anything ..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-enjoy-cairngorms-comfort-armchair","story":"The hotels, bars and restaurants are quiet, the visitors are at home.

factories where parents once worked or churches where grandparents worshipped.Captured in black and white, and with many showing streets remarkably clear of the traffic that would soon come, some , fascinating photographs of Scottish le taken during the s and s have presented Scots with the ultimate lockdown puzzle.Images taken by staff working for the long-defunct Scottish Development Department have been made available online for the first time by Historic Environment Scotland , along with an appeal to the public to turn detective and help identy the houses, streets and businesses they show.They may have their work cut out: the new online archive showcases rural and urban Scotland, from Highland crofts and Orkney farms to large housing estates in Fe, city tenements in Glasgow, unidentied town centre shops with old-fashioned signs and equally old-fashioned looking shoppers.While some may be easy to locate, others are likely to have viewers scratching their heads over where they may be.As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, head of archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember.ldquoSome show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location.Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff. The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued.The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever.Last year alone, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh, and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom.Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ferguson added: ldquoThese archives give a unique perspective on civic planning in the th century including the development and growth of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while the images of excavations showcase the sites that helped archaeologists unlock the secrets of Scotlandrsquos past ndash from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt.

But it is a plan that should give the people of the United Kingdom hope. Hope that we can rebuild hope that we can save lives hope that we can safeguard livelihoods.ldquoIt will require much from us all: that we remain alert that we care for those at most risk that we pull together as a United Kingdom. We will continue to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure these outcomes for everybody, wherever they live in the UK.The Prime Minister says the plan seeks to ldquo le to as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible, in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS.He adds: ldquoThis is one of the biggest international challenges faced in a generation. But our great country has faced and overcome huge trials before. Our response to these unprecedented and unpredictable challenges must be similarly ambitious, selfless and creative.The document reveals consideration is being given to allow people south of the border to expand their household group to include one other household \"in the same exclusive group,\" which could be based on the New Zealand model of household \"bubbles\". Such a move would allow more social contact and support some families ing to work by, for example, allowing two households to share childcare.People are told they may drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance, so long as they respect social distancing guidance while they are there because this does not involve contact with people outside their own household.The guidance then notes: ldquoWhen travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to dferent parts of the UK where it would be inconsistent with guidance or regulations issued by the relevant devolved administration.Last week, a family from London were caught on the M near Carlisle attempting an -mile round trip from London to Motherwell for a three-day lockdown holiday.From this week in England and Wales, people will be able to take part in more leisure activities outdoors, provided at all times they follow the social distancing rules.Under phase one, these will include having picnics, sunbathing, swimming in lakes and in the sea, playing golf and tennis. Consequently, golf courses, tennis and basketball courts will all be able to reopen from Wednesday.Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and \"ticketed outdoor leisure venues\" - where there is a higher risk of close contact - remain off-limits, however.The reopening of such leisure facilities may only be \"fully possible signicantly later\" depending on the reduction in infections, adds the guidance.Downing Street confirmed that, under the new lockdown rules for south of the border, an inidual could meet with one person who was not from their household in an outdoor setting such as a park, provided the two-metre distance rule were observed.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman explained: \"You could go to the park with your household and, whereas at the moment you would have to be exercising, you can do that for leisure.\"So, you could sit down with members of your family or those of you in the same household, you could sunbathe or have a picnic or whatever. Thats one thing.\"Alternatively,just you went out, you could meet one other person not from your household in the park and, provided they stay two metres away from you, you can sit down alongside one another and chat, sunbathe, do whatever.\"What you cant do is combine those two things. You cant go out with your household, adding one other person to it,\" he added.Phase two from June could see the phased reopening of nurseries and primary schools as well as non-essential shops, the staging of sports events like football matches behind closed doors and the reopening of some public transport.Phase three, which would occur no earlier than July , could see hairdressers reopen as well as some pubs, hotels, places of worship and cinemas, so long as social distancing rules can be applied.Asked about the warning from Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, that even modest changes could have the potential to risk lives, Professor Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos Chief Medical Officer, said the expert group SAGE was recommending the slight easing because there was a ldquolittle bit of room for manoeuvre given the number of infected cases was falling and the infection rate was already below one.\"We are confident the risk of being outdoors, in terms of meeting people, provided it is with social distancing, is signicantly lower than that of indoors.\"We are confident these quite small changes will not have a material effect, on their own, provided people stick to the social distancing and the rules that are there, on increasing the R beyond where we are at the moment.\"He added: \"We are not claiming there are no risks in this but what we think is that they are very small and proportionate to the advantage of overall wellbeing, exercise leading to good health and sustainability.\"The Government document explains how ministers and officials are examining how to enable people to gather in ldquoslightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.It goes on: \"Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.\"Among the new recommended measures is the wearing of face-coverings.It explains that because of increased mobility as more peopleto work the Government is now advising that people should ldquoaim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.The document points out how face-coverings are not intended to help the wearer but protect against any inadvertent transmission of the disease to others.ldquoA face covering is not the same as a facemask such as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers. These supplies must continue to be reserved for those who need it. Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face-coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.Prof Whitty pointed out how there had been scientic debate across many countries on the efficacy of face-coverings and, on balance, SAGE decided there was evidence of a ldquomodest effect in a person, who had the virus without knowing it for two to three days, being able to protect someone . He pointed out the scientic evidence was not strong enough to make the wearing of masks compulsory. He also stressed wearing face-coverings was not an alternative to social distancing.Last month, the Scottish Government recommended face-coverings in restricted areas but at the time the UK Government did not. However, its experts now believe that wearing them can produce a small but positive benefit, particularly in restricting the transmission from an infected person, who might not be showing signs of having the disease."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10306315.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-germany-infection-rate-continues-rise-lockdown-eases","story":"Latest figuresfrom the Robert Koch Instituteshowthat the coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany is now ., up from . the day before and . on Friday.Mondays figure meansthat every patient is infecting at least one other.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The dference appears to be largely in emphasis and timing.“But this isn’t the time for our national leaders to be playing politics. It’s critical that we have a clear message that people continue to follow all the advice and guidelines.”The convener said he was not too concerned that dferent parts of the UK were thinking about the lockdown exit dferently.“In one sense everybody talks about ‘the science’. There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve the “world-class health service” they benefit from.He added: “I think we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh a bhaintighearna","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.A bheil sibh eòlach air Gleann Eireachd ann an Siorrachd Pheairt  Tha Uisge Eireachd a’ sruthadh troimhe – sin an abhainn a tha a’ dol tro Bhlàr Ghobharaidh.Tha e air creag os cionn na h-aibhne., seo na chanas an t-Suirbhidh Òrdanais anns an Leabhar Ainmean aca: ‘Aig oir a’ bhearraidh, chithear fhathast tobhta tùir # air a bheil Caisteal na Baintighearna Liondsaidh, anns an robh o chionn nan ceudan bhliadhnaichean, nighean a bhuineadh don chinneadh uasal Crawford air a glasadh a-staigh fad a beatha mar thoradh air breith a’ Phàip #’ Agus dè rinn i – a’ Bhaintighearna Liondsaidh a bha seo Seo agaibh an sgeulachd.

and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction Hunter, rather than just ‘flogging it’, whatever ‘it’ turns out to be, for a £.I’ll head to Vegas, spin Chumlee a great line about my cousin Donald, and cash in on the great-great-grandmother.Memo to self: check the lineage and silence Bill Lawson.Ach, I might even disappear up to Dutch Harbour for a while and see what the fishing’s like with my old pal, Sig Hansen on the ‘Northwestern’.The Barents Sea looks like a doddle compared to Broad Bay, although the weather might require an extra pair of Damart.I might watch Ricky Gervais’ ‘After Le’ again the first time was a bit ‘misty’ in parts.I recommend it to you.In between I’ll do the odd lottery, online naturally, just to add to the suspense when I get ‘lucky’.Lucky is a relative term.The ‘congratulations, you have a winning ticket’ email is one of the tricks le likes to play on us all in its huge panoply of crushing disappointments, dressed up full of promise.I like to leave it a while before checking, spending the £ million carefully, ensuring the family are sorted before I buy my own train.The accumulated £. may require pooling.I won’t let any win ruin my positive, cheerful, disposition.When it comes to big numbers, the latest book, Matt Parker’s ‘Humble Pi’ doesn’t take long to leave you whistling at how unprepared you were to comprehend something as ‘small’ as a trillion.He was asked once to go onto tv to explain when the UK national debt crept up to this figure.Can#t be far past a billion, right Wrong!He explained it thus.A million seconds is nearly  days.A billion seconds is nearly  years.Ok, so now you’re in the ‘ballpark’, aren’t you Nah.A trillion seconds would take us all to the year .Yup,  years into the future.So how long to the end of the lockdown and ‘things’ get back to what’s being called the ‘new normal’ As long as it takes to guarantee the safety of each and every one of us, especially the most vulnerable, should be the answer, but these are strange times.Don’t count the seconds.Count the sunny days and savour each and every one of them.And yes, I know it’s probably snowing this weekend.It’s peat-cutting season.I wasn’t going to mention the coronavirus crisis, but unfortunately it’s caught up with us in a very real and devastating way.No amount of books, tv and fantasy can hide us from harsh reality.It’s nice to digress, but my thoughts are with the families affected in Skye.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

They include Cara Doranfrom north Belfast, who for the past six years has been a receptionist at Belfast#s Merchant Hotel, a casualty of the Covid- crisis and now closed along with countless other bars and restaurants.With no idea when she will be back behind her desk in the lobby, Cara was keen to use her free time to make a dference through volunteering.Now for six days a week she is one of the #soup-er heroes# making deliveries throughout the greater Shankill area to the most vulnerable, elderly and those in need.On a typical day Cara packs her car full of deliveries before heading to around  homes, where people of all ages are isolating from the virus.After a few days of being at home when the hotel closed I just knew that I had to do something during this pandemic, Cara said.With all this free time on my hands, I couldn#t just sit about not helping out people in need. I saw an advert on Facebook that the Spectrum Centre were seeking drivers for soup deliveries and got in touch.It#s contact-free work where I deliver the soup and leave it outside the homes, rap the door and then walk away.Cara says the work has been really fulfilling.Everyone is friendly and very appreciative. Some are quite lonely and do like to have a chat, which is fine, and I do.From a mental health point of view, doing this is a great help as it gets you motivated to get up and go out.If I can help out in any way when this is all over, I will stay involved with the centre, Cara added.Meanwhile, Joan Murphyis four weeks into her stint delivering soup with the same group, having been furloughed from her job at the Movie House Cinema at Yorkgate, where she has worked for  years.I locked the cinema doors for the last time on St Patrick#s Day and it was a really weird feeling not knowing when the projectors would be back on again, Joan said.After two weeks of pacing the floor I knew that I needed to be doing something and started following some community pages on social media who needed drivers for delivery.Giving up a few hours for three days each week really isn#t that much, but you get to know those you meet on the run and your fellow volunteers.I#m loving being a part of this as I#m getting a lot out of it and it gives your week some structure too. Plus I#m getting to know parts of Belfast I had never been to before.Tens of thousands of food packages are also being delivered to those who are shielding, the financially vulnerable or people who may be experiencing dficulties physically accessing food.Numerous local voluntary groups are involved, including Cregagh Community Association in east Belfast, and it#s where Joanne Snoddenhelps to deliver  food and essential items parcels every Friday.The mum-of-two was a children#s play worker with Venture Kids after school club and was keen to help others in whatever way she could.It gives me a reason to get up, dressed and get out there, Joanne explained.We put the parcels together in Mount Merrion Church and then normally ide the runs up so you take about six each.Last Friday when I dropped off a parcel with one wee man he just burst into tears he was so happy.My daughter was in the car at the time and she asked me why he was crying, so I had to explain it was because he was thankful as he can#t get out himself.This has also been a chance for her to learn the importance of helping others.Elsewhere Maura O#Brienfrom Glengormley was previously an administrator with a construction firm for over three years before being furloughed on April .Now she is using her free time to do shopping for an elderly couple who are self-isolating after registering with the Volunteer Now website.It#s a chance to give something back because initially I felt a sense of guilt that I was still being paid to do nothing whilst others are working hard on the front line, Maura said.I phone the couple every week, get their order for groceries the next day, do the shopping and then leave it on their porch.At this stage I know their shopping list better than my own.They are a lovely couple and you could easily sit and talk to them all day on the phone.I#m glad to be doing this as I can#t get to see my own parents back in Co Tyrone at the moment.You#d love to be able to do more but every little helps.I#d urge anyone considering doing something to help others so just get out there and do it, she added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thousands of former nurses have come out of retirement to help the health service deal with the coronavirus outbreak and thousands of students are also helping by working in extended clinical placements.Health Minister Robin Swann said: International Nurses Day is particularly important this year not only because it is the th anniversary of Florence Nightingale#s birth, but because of the exceptional work of nurses in our response to coronavirus.I want to thank each and every one of our incredible nurses who are on the front line in the battle against the greatest public health crisis of our time.I know how much the public#s support and the clapping that has been ringing out from doorsteps every Thursday has buoyed our health and social care workers. It would mean a great dealpeople once again showed their gratitude by shining a light for nurses this Tuesday.First Minister Arlene Foster said: How fitting it is that  has been designated the Year of the Nurse and Midwe, because this is the year that we will remember the enormous contribution of our nurses and healthcare staff in the fight against Coronavirus.Florence Nightingale#s dedication, skill and transformative care of patients is synonymous with the values and expertise so evident in the modern day nursing profession in Northern Ireland.This Tuesday, on International Nurses Day, let us recognise their incredible dedication, their professionalism, and their enormous personal sacrice for the good of us all.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said: Our nurses are a shining light. While this emergency situation has brought their contribution to the fore, we must recognise the importance of their role in caring for us, and our families, throughout our lives.When we come out the other side of this crisis, one of the positives we can take from it is ensuring that our nurses and other health and social care staff get the recognition they deserve.A range of local landmarks, monuments and council buildings will be illuminated blue, the colour of the nurse, tomorrow evening.Professor Greta Westwood, CEO of the Florence Nightingale Foundation, said: Florence Nightingale, herself a trailblazer during her career, would have been proud at the way nurses have followed in her footsteps as pioneers and leaders in the fight against the pandemic.

Peter Marley has been using the restrictions on movement to work on a series of portraits.#Sociable Distance# is the working title of his special project, an ongoing series of photographs captured during the Covid- pandemic.He explained how he has been using his daily walk to make images that create a time capsule of this unusual period in which we find ourselves.I#ve been making portraits with friends, neighbours and strangers, all from a responsible distance, he said.And it has been a great way to stay connected to a community whilst documenting the much quieter streets of Belfast.Peter , from Glenarf, Co Antrim, is married to -year-old Zjena, a costume designer who is originally from Croatia. They are expecting their first child.He normally works in the TV and film industry, but as that has come to global standstill he has turned his hand to this innovative challenge.To date his series comprises around  pieces and has gained momentum over the last few weeks as people have started to learn of his unique project.But although he suggested that he may hit , he stressed that he never really works with a target in mind, adding: That adds more pressure to how I work and makes it more goal-orientated as opposed to being an organic process.Peter said: I respond to people getting in touch with me but I also chat to neighbours and strangers to give the project a little spontaneity.It allows me to meet people who aren#t in my immediate friend circle or extended neighbour group.A few would also be the unemployed film community, it#s almost like checking in on them, just to have a chat, and then quite a few of them would be strangers who got in touch with me after exposure of the project online, or strangers I found in their garden enjoying the sun or at the doorstep.Having worked on portrait projects before, Peter said the idea for this one came from him checking in on friends who where nearby but hadn#t really had anyone to chat with.I#ve done similar things to document changes going on around the country or strange events whenever they pop up, he said.So this was almost to create a time capsule for something that doesn#t happen too often where people are instantly changing their day to day habits.Everything like shopping has gone from a daily convenience to a weekly extravagance.People have been very responsive and very quick to change their habits, from getting coffee on the street to preparing at home. Even thought the portraits were a way of making sure friends and family were okay, it was also a way of documenting how quickly our local community had changed.Hopefully that will be a record for .Perhaps the most striking thing for Peter has been the positivity of the people he has encountered on the way.There is an undercurrent of concern and worry but beyond that people are generally looking out for each other, he said.Some are running errands for their older neighbours. There#s a real compassion within the community.It#s warm and fantastic to see. If I had been told to imagine a dystopian future where people were wearing masks I would never have thought it was going to be so polite.Peter said that once the series is complete he hopes to hold an exhibition locally and produce a photobook of his work.My projects tend to culminate in an isolated photobook of portraits, he said.But this time I#ve also tried to include street photography just to give a wider context.And because of the phenomenal weather we#ve been having the portraits have an almost too positive a hue so I#m including deserted places, a lot of the signage relating to Covid- and the amount of discarded plastic gloves to give it a wider context for  and quarantine - otherwise it#s just a lot of people having barbecues.The main thing is to document what#s happening during lockdown and create a record of it.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The psychologists - who questioned a representative group of ,  to -year-olds - say one in five adolescent men aged between - said they had been sent on their way, arrested, fined or taken home by police for breaking the rules, compared to just one in  women of the same age.It comes as First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill expressed concern at the flaunting of coronavirus regulations in Belfast. The politicians, who come from small rural communities in counties Fermanagh and Tyrone respectively where social distancing is more strictly adhered to, have regularly observed blatant breaches of social distancing restrictions when travelling to and from Stormont.Executive sources have warned that this could lead to a slowing of the pace in lting the lockdown throughout Northern Ireland.Both ministers were shocked by what they witnessed in Belfast in the past week, where people were out and about, mixing together, like it was a normal day. There was little social distancing taking place, and this hit home to Arlene and Michelle as they are from small rural communities where folk have been following the rules rigidly, a source told the Sunday Le.Numerous street parties took place across Belfast on Friday to celebrate VE Day at which the current guidelines were openly ignored. Adults from dferent households were observed eating and drinking together, while their children were playing on bouncy castles. Photographs taken on Saturday also showed large groups together in the city enjoying the sunshine. Meanwhile, dozens of cars were seen lining the hard shoulder for half a mile along the entrance to Gosford Forest Park in Co Armagh.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs.

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Dermot Morrow will taking part in Australia, Lee Kennedy in Canada, Rory McEldowney in New York and Jenni Ross-Boyle was promoting it from outside Buckingham Palace.All runners will be following routes as close to their homes as possible to follow the social distancing guidelines. The times and distances are logged and passed back to Karen and Brian Oacuteg for totting up the progress.“Yeah, everyone is involved now, but it is only the senior teams who are running through the night, we want to keep it as safe as possible. Everyone  will be running from .am and finishing up around .pm,” Karen continues.At the time of publication, the club had raised pound,.“We have been doing very well. At the start, we have set the target of two grand and weve more than doubled that with a week to go.”Looking ahead to this weekend, the club is appealing to as many as possible to get involved.“Its a case of the more the merrier between the hours of am to pm, you dont have to be from Kilrea –you want to run on behalf of someone who died from any chest, heart and stroke related issues. If you dont want to run, you can walk or jog,” Karen concluded.All the proceeds are going towards the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke, a cause in the clubs thoughts.Last June, they lost U manager Brian Calvert to a sudden heart attack and also prominent clubman Tommy Donaghy recently passed away. googletag.cmd.push All donations, no matter how small are greatly appreciated.

We take a look at how you can protect yourself, your friends and your family from being tricked into believing news and information that is not true, or becoming a victim of fraud. The vast majority of the people across the UK have taken the official advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. googletag.cmd.push People are hungry for accurate information about how to protect themselves, but following the official advice and ignoring the swirling mass of uninformed conjecture, opinion and speculation is not always easy. However, there are ways to identy who to trust, and who to ignore. Similarly, there are ways to identy the small but persistent group of unscrupulous iniduals who have decided that they want to use the pandemic to try to make financial gain through fraud. There have been a lot of examples of  information and attempts at fraud. For example, holding your breath for  seconds is not a test for coronavirus, gargling water for  seconds is not a cure and phone masts cannot cause coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push There have also been comments and suggestions from people claiming to be medical experts who are simply not. Fraudsters will use any opportunity - including the current pandemic - to try to trick people out of their money. There have been examples of fake texts claiming to be sent from the Government alerting people they have received a fine for breaking social distancing rules. Some people and even businesses have been tricked into paying for protective face masks and hand sanitizers from companies that don’t exist There have also been messages from criminals sending messages to trick people into thinking they are getting genuine offers of financial support from the government. At the same time, hackers are stepping up attempts to access people’s networks and steal their log in details and passwords. However,you take sensible precautions, you can quickly spot signs of fraud and identy the facts from the fiction. Sharing the right information could save lives. How you can spot  information When it is shared,  information can take on a le of its own and have some serious consequences. It can lead to health scares,  accusations and potentially damaging hoax stories. Recently there has been a lot of this kind of  information about coronavirus. It’s not always easy to spot, so use this checklist to cut through the chatter.  TRUSTED SOURCE: Journalists provide accurate information SOURCE Rely on official sources for medical and safety information. Check the facts about coronavirus on official websites.

It’s okay to refuse or ignore requests for your money or detailsyou are suspicious - only criminals will try to rush or panic you. The police and banks will never ask you to withdraw money or transfer it to a dferent account. Neither will they ask you to reveal your full banking password or PIN. You can check that requests are genuine by using a known number or email address to contact organisations directly. Andyou think you have fallen victim to a scam, then contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. You can report suspicious texts by forwarding the original message to , which spells SPAM on your keypad. SHARE CAUTION Be careful what you share, because things are not always what they seem online.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Over the last month, hundreds of messages of support have flooded into local SuperValu and Centra stores, as customers pay tribute to the huge efforts local retailers have been making to keep food on people’s tables right across Northern Ireland. These heart-warming messages have lted the spirts of hardworking local retailers and their teams, as they work tirelessly to keep shelves stocked and queues moving. Now, SuperValu and Centra are planning to pay this positivity back. The retail brands are asking customers in Derry to nominate their local store hero – the people that are going above and beyond to help their local communities during the Covid- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push For every nomination, SuperValu and Centra will donate pound to their long-standing charity partner, Action Cancer. With fundraising events cancelled and Action Cancer retail shops closed as a result of the Covid- Pandemic, the charity needs to raise vital funds, so it can provide le-saving cancer prevention, detection and support services to those most in need as soon as services can get back up and running.  Launching the new initiative, Desi Derby, Marketing Director for SuperValu and Centra in NI said: “Our frontline workers are going above and beyond and doing a fantastic job – making sure shelves are stocked, delivering to those in need and ensuring customers stay safe when in store. googletag.cmd.push We have been overwhelmed by the dferent messages of thanks and appreciation that have come in from our customers whether on social media or via our customer services team and so we wanted to recognise this in the first instance. “Those same frontline colleagues also work tirelessly every year to raise money for Action Cancer and asked how we could do more when social distancing prevents the normal fundraisers such as in-store cycles and coffee mornings. So, we decided to bring the recognition of our colleagues and our commitment to support our charity partner together. We are now asking customers to take the time to nominate the person in your local store that has made a real dference. Andat this time of crisis, when our charity partner Action Cancer is seeing a substantial drop in income, being able to help support them too is extremely important to us.” People can nominate their local store hero on the SuperValu or Centra Facebook page or by emailingsupervalu.localhero@musgrave.ieor centra.localhero@musgrave.ie.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident

by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs

natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair, who spent more than half an hour in the water without wet suits or lejackets, were only saved by a quick thinking passer-by who raised the alarm and contacted the Coastguard.With incidents like this

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down.

He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since . I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.

We’ve seen some retailers doing delivery numbers they thought they’d be doing in eight years’ time.“But there’s a big, big thing here - there are people out there, disabled, elderly, and we’re asking the public to think before they click. Quite simply, delivery slots should be for the most vulnerable in society.”Instead the public should either get their own groceriesor get click-and-collects.The whole surge means that “here in Northern Ireland our retailers are hiring proportionately... some are permanent contracts, some are temporary”.He said they were “hiring for attitude, and training for skill” - meaning people with few qualications can still find roles in the supermarkets.He also said that “one of the laziest  narratives out there is that retailers are making a killing”. Rather, their margins have been squeezed by people buying cheaper ‘own brand’ goods instead of treating themselves.Lastly, he voiced “pride” in how day-to-day staff are handling themselves in the crisis, adding there is a “zero tolerance” approach to people shouting and becoming confrontationalasked to socially distance themselves.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We’ve been able to make a lot of changes that will be very positive and I think will become embedded in practice after this is all an awful memory. It’s incredible how the red tape has disappeared and has been replaced by a ‘can do’ attitude throughout the ious levels of the service.”What struck me most about her response was that it was very similar to what I’ve heard from others over the past few weeks. Indeed, I’ve been both surprised and heartened by the ‘can do’ attitude of so many of those who’ve found themselves on the frontline for weeks on end. For years we’ve taken these people for granted always expecting them to be there when we need them and then being surprised when we realise how much they’ve always been doing for us on a daily basis.It is worth bearing in mind – because it says a great deal about pre-crisis attitudes – that just a few months ago criticism of the NHS, of waiting lists, of missed appointments, of infections acquired during hospital stays , of suddenly cancelled operations, of crowded A and Es and of consultants not being available for months on end, was re. An increase in home working is an almost inevitable consequence of the coronavirus pandemic \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Now, millions of people are clapping their support every Thursday evening. It took a crisis of this magnitude to make people realise the value of the NHS and it took a crisis of this magnitude for politiciansto realise how brilliantly, speedily and bravely the NHS was able to rise to this challenge. In a column for the News Letter a couple of weeks ago I expressed a fear that a key lessonfrom the crisis – the need for specic changes and increased funding for the NHS – would be forgotten once people believed le had ed to normal. Let’s be honest, there’s not much point in clapping todaywe cop out of the economic consequences tomorrow is there  Sadly, I still think that’s what’s likely to happen.I think it’s also likely that increasing numbers will remain working from home full-time. A lot of businesses have realised that it’s not necessary to have people driving, bussing, cycling or getting a train to work, just to sit in an office for hours on end. A computer or laptop works just as well at home. Meetings are easily arranged through Skype and Zoom. Staff can work in a way that suits them best. Flexi work becomes easier, not least because offices don’t need to be kept open from am to pm. Computer technology has already created paperless offices and it was almost inevitable that peopleless offices wouldn’t be far behind.What we’ve seen across the world since January has been the test-driving of a new way of running businesses and running our personal lives. Again, it has been heartening to see how well we’ve all adapted how so many of us have realised that it is possible to do things dferently and maybe even do them better. I was listening to an interview with someone who has spent almost four hours every day commuting to an office in the centre of London to sit at a computer at a desk because, “well, that’s just the way it has been done for years. When this ends a lot of us, with the firm’s blessing, will continue to work from home”.There is an advertisement on the back of last week’s The Economist: ‘Tradition is history. Disruption is the law of tomorrow. The rules of business and society have changed. % of jobs that will exist in  haven’t been invented yet. How will you embrace the opportunities  Discover what you can do with the law of tomorrow, today...’. I’m old enough to have already seen a huge change in working and types of work in my letime and I’m now going to see another huge change. People shouldn’t be scared. Societal upheaval is normal following a great crisis or change . This health crisis has already made us reassess a number of the fundamentals of our everyday lives and how we live them. So yes, there will be consequences and changes: in how we live our lives and in how we work. Our welfare state – with the NHS at its heart – is probably the single most important consequence to follow the VE Day celebrations in . As a nation, we knew that we wanted change.Certain types of crises can be predicted and war-gamed. It’s absolutely certain, for example, that there will be new economic collapses, political upheavals and pandemicseach of which will result in sweeping changes and new ways of doing things. There may even be a world war . All of these eventualities can be thought about, computer-modelled and tested. What we cannot test is the psychological impact on the millions of iniduals who will bear the brunt of the impact.But even the experts didn’t predict that the two minutes silence on VE Day would happen under lockdown conditions. No one had war-gamed that possibility. Anything and everything can change: and change without warning. For young people that’s the most important lesson to take from this crisis.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In anticipation of what none of us wants to hear, politicians at Westminister got an earful from no less a person than Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, who warned there could be ‘social unrest’the over s are ‘forced to endure a longer lockdown than the younger generation’.This is a country where once upon a time women could retire at  and men at  – as that was regarded as old age. But people have been living longer due to better living standards, the results of all the hard work the baby boomer generation put in right up to the present time. This appears to have emboldened successive Governments to raise the age of retirement age for both men and women. More money in the public coffers is the result.

Putting up the age of retirement also means there will be less years for state pensions to be paid out.I worry at what appears to be the increasing use of the term ‘healthy over s’. What exactly does that mean  Few people in this age category I suspect enjoy perfect health, otherwise GPs across the land wouldn’t be advising them to take statins to keep blood pressure levels down. Women have been encouraged to take HRT long after menopause, even staying on it for leneeds be. These le enhancers, as some medical people appear to regard them, may be just the ticket. But how are we to know since the latter, statins, are relatively new to the people whilst HRT still attracts controversy Do either of these treatments increase longevity  We simply don’t know the answer to that question.Locking down the over-s, many of whom will still be paying tax to the Government, could be interpreted in many ways. I will take the kindly approach and suggest that the Government will need all the scope it has to get the economy back up and running schools will have to be re-opened and plans will have to be laid for the possibility of a future pandemic since the current one caught everyone by surprise and left the country on its knees. With the absolute necessity to get people back to work and paying income tax, the Government must have thought the oldies could wait and since many of them will have ious ailments it could be dressed up as ‘protecting them’. One Cabinet minister has said the whole thing ‘is to be based around consent rather than compulsion’.That’s fine, but it appears no one asked us first whether we wanted to be lockdowned for longer or left to do our own thing.I certainly do not want to be on lockdown for any more weeks than I have to because once you hit your s le seems to go by in a flash. It seems no time since my children were clinging to my skirts wanting me to play in the garden. Anniversaries and birthdays came and went with me so busy I scarcely noticed. The children grew up with me hardly noticing the years go by and then they were off to university. They found themselves wives, leaving us at home, on our own, wondering where all the years had gone.

We’ve seen some retailers doing delivery numbers they thought they’d be doing in eight years’ time.“But there’s a big, big thing here - there are people out there, disabled, elderly, and we’re asking the public to think before they click. Quite simply, delivery slots should be for the most vulnerable in society.”Instead the public should either get their own groceriesor get click-and-collects.The whole surge means that “here in Northern Ireland our retailers are hiring proportionately... some are permanent contracts, some are temporary”.He said they were “hiring for attitude, and training for skill” - meaning people with few qualications can still find roles in the supermarkets.He also said that “one of the laziest  narratives out there is that retailers are making a killing”. Rather, their margins have been squeezed by people buying cheaper ‘own brand’ goods instead of treating themselves.Lastly, he voiced “pride” in how day-to-day staff are handling themselves in the crisis, adding there is a “zero tolerance” approach to people shouting and becoming confrontationalasked to socially distance themselves.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
