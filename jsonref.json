The policy, which sees China build infrastructure projects in developing countries, has been criticised because the regime can seize assets in the event of a debt default or exert influence over these countries.Later that year, the Duke unveiled the multiple-language editions of President Xi’s propaganda book, The Governance Of China, at an event in London.Mareike Ohlberg, co-author of Hidden Hand, a book that details the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to influence opinion overseas, said: ‘Prince Andrew is a classic “useful idiot” and seemingly allows himself to be used.’US think-tanks the Hoover Institution and the Asia Society have both accused CPIFA of being a part of the broader United Front work groups that seek to influence foreign elites.It is understood the Prince’s visits were funded by Pitch@Palace, which established a Chinese arm in 2016. The Royal Court Circular lists his visits to China but does not mention CPIFA or its invitations.The UK arm of Pitch@Palace is to be wound up in the wake of Andrew stepping back from Royal duties, but it is believed its global operations will continue.Last night, a source close to the Duke said: ‘Any foreign dignitary would always be hosted by the CPIFA.‘The Duke was in attendance on behalf of Pitch@Palace Global.’The Chinese Embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Carole Middleton uses Marie Antoinette phrase starving masses Queens Jubilee","story":"Share this article Then the firm offered state-carriage-shaped vases made out of cardboard, coat-of-arms cups with the words ‘Long Live G \u0026amp T’ and canape flags featuring crown-wearing corgis.Royal biographer Margaret Holder said: ‘I don’t think that the Queen will be annoyed about it.

I\u0027m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.\u0027 There has been much debate about the effectiveness of ivermectin during the pandemic after it was hailed as vaccine sceptics as a miracle cure. The hype started early in the pandemic when ivermectin was shown to destroy the virus in lab studies. Several dozen trials have also indicated that the pills may have some value in the pandemic - either by using them on patients with Covid, or as a preventative.But, according to a BBC investigation last year, around a third of studies advocating ivermectin\u0027s use were seriously flawed or biased in some way, making the results unreliable. Reviews by health authorities in the US, UK and EU have found there is insufficient evidence for using the drug against Covid.The first double-blind, gold-standard clinical trial into ivermectin is currently being carried out in Oxford, as part of the PRINCIPLE trial.Definitive results on the drug are expected this year.  Currently in the UK, health watchdogs do not recommend any clinicians prescribe the drug but, as a safe and approved medicine, it can be obtained privately. Fox recently got engaged to prep school teacher Arabella Fleetwood Neagle, 28.Miss Fleetwood Neagle apparently supports his political campaigning as she was pictured alongside him on the top deck of his Reclaim Party\u0027s battle bus during his unsuccessful bid to become London Mayor last year.Fox – whose acting dynasty includes his father James and cousin Emilia – was dropped by his agent in 2020 after a string of social media comments.Last year he said he could remove his children from school over his opposition to the Covid vaccination programme.He said he would educate them at home rather than let them be vaccinated without his consent.Fox shares custody of his boys with Miss Piper, whom he orced in 2016.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Ex BBC journalist Rory Cellan Jones reflects grief losing pet Collie cross Cabbage","story":" \u0027Worst of all she seemed miserable, finding no joy in life anymore.\u0027After a conversation with an extremely sympathetic vet, we decided it was time to let her go. We stroked her as she quietly slipped away. We are of course devastated.\u0027Cabbage was such a sweet-natured animal and had been part of our family ever since we picked her up from the Dogs Trust rescue home in 2007.\u0027I find myself taken aback by the extent of my grief.\u0027 Cases of dogs falling ill had been reported on UK coastlines, with cases now said to have been found inland too. The British Veterinary Association said this month that the illness was likely to be a virus, which results in \u0027gastroenteritis-like symptoms\u0027, including diarrhea and vomiting. They said they are aware of reports, but added there is currently no evidence linking walks on the beach to the bug. BVA President Justine Shotton told MailOnline: \u0027We\u0027re very sorry to hear about this case. Vets see gastroenteritis cases in dogs relatively commonly in practice and the vast majority are mild, with the animals just needing time or some supportive care to make a full recovery. Sadly, in very rare situations, it can lead to secondary complications or even death.\u0027At this time, we can\u0027t speculate on what might be causing the symptoms in the cases being reported from Yorkshire and other parts of the UK. While pet owners are understandably worried, the spike may be part of a normal increase in gastroenteritis that vets see during the colder months.\u0027Our advice to concerned owners is to contact their local vet for prompt treatment if their dog shows any signs of illness, such as vomiting and diarrhoea.\u0027Although many cases are more mild, there is a risk of serious illness, as happened to Duke. Dog owners are advised to contact their vets if they spot any of these symptoms.   Cabbage had a bout of a gastroenteritis-like bug a few weeks ago and had spent some time in the \u0027doggy hospital\u0027. Cellan-Jones shared a photo of Cabbage on Twitter on Saturday morning, writing: \u0027For 14 years she was a lovely, energetic and really smart member of our family.\u0027It was time for her to go but we miss her so much.\u0027The post accrued more than 20,000 likes and Cabbage started to trend on UK Twitter.Cabbage already had an online following before she was stolen because Cellan-Jones regularly documented their early morning walks with pictures posted to his feed.\u0027At the beginning of lockdown, actually posting a picture of a day was a kind of therapy for me, because the walk was the only thing that was allowed,\u0027 he explained.\u0027(I think) it kind of reminded (people) everything was OK with the world when they got up.\u0027On Friday morning Cellan-Jones shared a final picture, writing: \u0027Home after a gentle stroll.\u0027He thanked his followers for their support, adding that the park on his daily walk this morning \u0027felt empty\u0027.BBC Breakfast host Dan Walker and broadcaster Sophie Raworth offered their condolences.\u0027So sorry to hear that Rory,\u0027 Walker replied, while Raworth said she \u0027loved Cabbage\u0027s adventures\u0027.Cabbage went missing after her dog walker left his van\u0027s engine running with the key in the ignition in west London and it was stolen.Cellan-Jones quickly appealed to users online for any sightings, garnering thousands of likes and retweets.\u0027Something terrible has happened,\u0027 he wrote at the time.\u0027Our dog walker\u0027s van with our dog Cabbage in it has been stolen while he was picking up another pet...

Photograph: ChesnotGetty ImagesPodcaster Joe Rogan has addressed controversy over his Spotify podcast, hours after the streaming service announced a plan to tackle the spread of Covid-19 misinformation.Mr Rogan, host of The Joe Rogan Experience, has sparked controversy for repeatedly spreading misinformation about Covid on his show, including the conspiracy theory that hospitals are financially incentivised to record Covid as a cause of death.He has also promoted the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic treatment used mainly on animals, to treat Covid symptoms. It has not been proved to be effective at preventing or treating Covid.In a 10-minute video posted to Instagram, the comedian and host pledged to “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” and “do my best to make sure I’ve researched these topics”.Mr Rogan framed his podcast – which reaches an estimated 11 million listeners per episode – as “just conversations” which “started off as having fun and talking”.“It’s become what it is today, which is some out of control juggernaut that I barely have control of,” he said. “Often times I have no idea what I’m gonna talk about until I sit down and talk to people. I am gonna do my best in the future to balance things out.”He also apologised to Spotify. “I want to thank Spotify for being so supportive during this time, and I’m very sorry that this is happening to them and that they’re taking so much from it.”The episodes sparked a fresh round of furore, including from musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell who pulled their music from Spotify as a result.“I’m not mad at Neil Young,” Mr Rogan said, describing himself as a lifelong fan of the singer.New measuresThe chief executive of Spotify, Daniel Ek, released an official statement setting out the streaming platform’s plan to tackle misinformation, as more users publicly unsubscribed from the service, more musicians withdrew their music and the company lost billions of dollars in market value.New content advisories will direct listeners of any podcast that discusses coronavirus to a dedicated website that “provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources”.Spotify’s rules for its creators have also been made public for the first time, with users told they cannot publish “content that promotes dangerous, false or dangerous, deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health”.Examples include calling Covid “a hoax or not real” or “encouraging people to purposely get infected with Covid-19 in order to build immunity to it”. Users who break the rule could see their content removed from the platform and repeat offenders could be suspended or banned.“You’ve had a lot of questions over the last few days about our platform policies and the lines we have drawn between what is acceptable and what is not. We have had rules in place for many years but admittedly, we haven’t been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,” Mr Ek’s statement said.Mr Ek wrote that the content advisories will roll out “around the world in the coming days”. “To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform,” he added.As of Sunday, Spotify had lost more than $2 billion (€1.8 billion) in market value and removed more than 20,000 episodes of podcasts that were related to Covid-19, in accordance with its “detailed content policies”.Calls on social media for people to cancel their Spotify subscriptions have intensified over the last week. The company has not disclosed how many users have left, but a message from its customer support team to subscribers said they were “getting a lot of contacts so may be slow to respond”.Spotify acquired Mr Rogan’s show in 2020, in a deal worth more than $100 million (€90 million). The Joe Rogan Experience is now Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"chapters closes its doors it s more than a bookshop it s really a bit of dublin","story":"Chapters bookstore in Dublin, Ireland’s largest independent book shop, has closed its doors after 40 years in business. Video: Bryan O’BrienCustomers in Chapters bookstore on Parnell Street, Dublin, before it closes on its final day of business. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe On the display tables in Chapters bookshop in Dublin, surrounding discounted titles is a sign with the words “I’ve been meaning to read that”.Many shoppers might have concluded that they had meant to visit Chapters on Parnell Street on occasions in the past, but never quite got there.Now it is too late. There are no shortages of mobile phone shops and fast food outlets within sight of Chapters. There’s only one bookshop in the area however, and it is gone in the same week that the world celebrates 100 years of Dublin’s most famous book, Ulysses.The largest independent bookstore in Ireland is another commercial casualty of the pandemic.Customer footfall was not a problem on the last trading day on Monday as long queues formed for the tills and customers filled up hard black plastic trolleys with their purchases.OriginsChapters, in its various guises, has been about since 1983, when it started in Wicklow Street. Its owners, brothers William and Ger Kinsella, moved to its current location in Parnell Street in 2006.The problems faced by independent bookshops long pre-dated the pandemic. Online behemoth Amazon has been eating the lunches of bookshops big and small for the last decade, and that was before the pandemic decimated city centre businesses like Chapters that are heavily dependent on the footfall of customers.On its last day, Chapters’ windows were mostly filled up with military history tomes selling at a fraction of the price they might be expected to command in normal times. Its second-hand section at the back of the premises was cleared out fairly quickly. Everything must go and mostly it did.“We have been pleasantly overwhelmed and run off our feet,” said Sara Whelan, the manager of Chapters and one of 20 full-time and part-time members of staff who now have to find new jobs.“Chapters stayed open during the pandemic doing phone and online sales. We knew it was an incredible shop and offered so much to the people of Dublin. It has made reading accessible for so many people with second-hand bargains and new releases. Generations of families have visited here.”Overseas tributesStaff member Emilie Deprez said wellwishers had made it known how much they appreciated Chapters, many of them from overseas.Long-time customer Leo O’Connor said that any time he needed a book, he would order through Chapters. “It’s more than a bookshop, it’s really a bit of Dublin,” he explained.Fellow long-time customer Randall Burkhardt has spent several hundred euro in recent weeks buying bargain-basement tomes which he hopes to be able to give to friends and family as presents.On Monday he carried out three large bags of books, yet the whole cost of it was just €32.63.“I am sad about it. It is nice to be able to be generous with books and not to worry about the cost,” he said.Mary Dwyer described the closure as a “great loss to Dublin” and said the bookshop had been “a wonderful resource for all age groups. It had a great variety of stuff.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"eu commission accused of maladministration by ombudsman over pfizer ceo texts","story":"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen exchanged text messages with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal. File photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union ombudsman accused the European Commission of maladministration on Friday for not disclosing text messages that the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, exchanged with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal.In an interview in April, Ms Von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Mr Bourla for a month when they were negotiating a vaccine contract for the bloc. But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19

scheming","story":"Anne Boleyn’s childhood home is launching a new exhibition to shed a “feminist” light on the queen and dispel the myth of her as a “scheming” mistress.She was accused of adultery and executed for treason in 1536, and experts have argued that the charges laid against her by men five centuries ago have lumbered her with an unfair reputation as a wily seductress ever since.A new exhibition at her childhood home at Hever Castle in Kent will seek to portray her in a more “feminist” light as an educated woman who made history in her own right, and not simply a “headless queen”.Featuring a miniature portrait of Anne that has never been displayed before, the show will mark the 500th anniversary of her debut in the court of Henry VIII, and use personal possessions to offer a humanising history of her early life before her fatal marriage.Dr Owen Emmerson, the curator of the exhibition, said: “We\u0027re really trying to challenge the idea that she and her family were scheming, grasping courtiers on the rise. We’re trying to dispel these myths.“It’s very difficult to try and claim Anne herself was a feminist, the concept hadn’t been invented yet.“But there has been a move to see her life and struggles in a feminist light. She was transgressive, she did break the rules of the time, she supported education for women.”He added: “Her life is so often told backwards, starting with her execution for treason, and then seen through that lens - but her execution was a stitch-up and it doesn\u0027t tell the whole story.“She was not just the scandalous wife, but played an active part, she played her role in history, and, actually, she changed history“It’s about time that we recognise that, and not just see as this headless Queen.”Becoming Anne: Connections, Culture, Court open on 4 March - 500 years to the day she entered English court life - and will use contemporary portraits and letters written at the time to explain her family’s rise from country gentry to royalty.Miniature portraits of Anne and the political players active during the 16th century, including Anne’s uncle Thomas Howard and King Francis I of France, will go on display alongside a recreation of the dress she wore to her first pageant at the English court in 1522.More from NewsBoris Johnson latest: Theresa May leads Tory backlash, as No 10 bows to pressure and vows to publish \u0026#39updated\u0026#39 reportSuspects arrested after two police officers shot dead in GermanyBA.2: omicron subvariant \u0026#39substantially\u0026#39 more transmissible than original, study findsUkraine latest: China says Russia\u0026#39s troop build-up not a \u0026#39threat\u0026#39 as it backs Moscow in UN Security Council meeting\u0026#39Does Boris Johnson think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 Tory MP attacks PM as he recalls grandmother\u0026#39s lockdown funeral while No 10 partiedFormer primary school teacher accused of punching a horse demands jury trialMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris isnt hook yet","story":"Just a few hours ago, the operation to rescue Boris Johnson appeared to be going according to plan. The interim Sue Gray report – or, as she called it, update – was unable to give a complete assessment into the partying ways of No 10. There was no clinching condemnatory phrase in the 12-page document. In the Commons, Johnson started off well enough, expressing what seemed like genuine remorse about the things that had gone wrong in Downing Street. But after being needled by Keir Starmer, a strain of impetuosity emerged that visibly concerned some backbenchers who had been minded to help him tough things out.A below-the-belt, barked-out comment about Starmer failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile may have been no more than retaliation for the deeply personal condemnation levelled at Johnson, that throughout his life, he has damaged everything and everyone along the way”. But this was supposed to be Johnson’s day of contrition and yet he could not bring himself to take an extended pasting with prime ministerial dignity and without firing back.After Starmer’s attack there followed wounding interventions from Theresa May and Andrew Mitchell on his own side – the latter sitting next to last week’s would-be assassin David Davis – and suddenly the supportive body language on the Tory benches was much reduced. The “partygate” furore is now back on the boil and all those who claimed that the PM can’t change his nature or his ways have seen their arguments strengthened.He can still tough it out and succeed in rallying his Commons troops and the wider Tory tribe behind him. But to do so he must first properly internalise the criticisms contained within the Gray report instead of acting like a spoiled child who will not be scolded. A meeting with all Tory MPs due this evening will be another crucial event in this, the first of at least two “Gray Days” he must go through before he can move clear of the tentacles of this whole affair.The most crucial phase of the scandal will surely come when the work of the politan Police is done. The fact that they are investigating a dozen gatherings – several of which the Prime Minister andor his wife attended – is chastening.After Johnson’s comprehensive victory at last week’s PMQs, Starmer won this round in the Commons. A Labour leader who tried to rat on the EU referendum verdict had quite a nerve to accuse the Prime Minister of “fraying the bonds of trust between the Government and the public, eroding our democracy”. But from Starmer’s point of view the needling worked. The pressure told. Instead of gently mocking him for his Brexit shenanigans, the Prime Minister snapped back wildly when he was meant to be playing rope-a-dope. He is not yet free of this quagmire.More from NewsBoris Johnson latest: Theresa May leads Tory backlash, as No 10 bows to pressure and vows to publish Sue Gray\u0026#39s \u0026#39updated\u0026#39 reportSuspects arrested after two police officers shot dead in GermanyBA.2: omicron subvariant \u0026#39substantially\u0026#39 more transmissible than original, study findsUkraine latest: China says Russia\u0026#39s troop build-up not a \u0026#39threat\u0026#39 as it backs Moscow in UN Security Council meeting\u0026#39Does Boris Johnson think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 Tory MP attacks PM as he recalls grandmother\u0026#39s lockdown funeral while No 10 partiedFormer primary school teacher accused of punching a horse demands jury trialMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"female banker shouted male colleagues catchphrase not now stacey","story":"A female banker who was shouted down by male colleagues with the catchphrase not now Stacey has won more than £2million in compensation for sexual discrimination. Stacey Macken, 50, sued French bank BNP Paribas after being belittled by her boss, who used the phrase so often that colleagues copied it.The finance specialist, who earned £120,000 a year, claimed that over a four-year period she received hundreds of thousands of pounds less than her male peers in salary and bonuses and that once she complained, managers targeted her with unfair treatment. Now Miss Macken has won £2,081,449 in one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal.The London Central tribunal heard Miss Macken was hired by BNP Paribas in 2013. Unbeknown to her, a male recruit hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000.Within months of joining, she claimed she was exposed to sexist behaviour involving one of her bosses in the Prime Brokerage team, Matt Pinnock. His former PA, Georgina Chapman, told a tribunal that a large Halloween-style black witch\u0027s hat was left on Miss Macken\u0027s desk after some of the team, including Mr Pinnock, had gone to the pub towards the end of the day. Ms Chapman said they were visibly drunk when they returned to the office that evening.The next morning, upon discovering the hat, Miss Macken asked Ms Chapman if she knew who had put it there.I told her that I did not know, but I suspected it was one of the drunk team members, because they were the only people in that area of the office the evening before, which, combined with their drunkenness, made them most likely to have done it, Ms Chapman said. Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.Another boss, Denis Pihan, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying not now, Stacey when she tried to talk to him. When (she) asked him questions he would tend to say \u0027not now, Stacey\u0027, the tribunal heard. He did so often that the (her) colleagues made sarcastic comments about it. In a chat on 21 March 2016 in which Mr Pihan was being discussed one of (them) wrote \u0027NOT NOW STACEY :-)\u0027.Miss Macken made repeated internal complaints about her treatment, in particular relating to her pay and bonuses.Eventually she took the bank to a tribunal, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.The tribunal heard in her first four years her male peer was paid more than £167,000 in bonuses compared to the £33,000 she received. The bank claimed they had hired her as a junior and that her male colleague deserved his higher salary because he was her senior.Miss Macken, from Fulham, west London, was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay.The tribunal ruled that leaving a witch\u0027s hat on her desk was an inherently sexist act and the regular use of not now, Stacey was branded a demeaning comment.At Miss Macken\u0027s compensation hearing Employment Judge Emma Burns said that Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively because she had raised concerns about her pay, and that they had a discriminatory motive.In our judgement, for an apology to be effective it needs to be genuine and heartfelt rather than ordered... We have taken into account the bank\u0027s failure to apologise when awarding aggravated damages.Mr Pihan apologised for causing distress at the tribunal but did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her. The bank claimed it has now adopted a \u0027detailed Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan\u0027 in response to its poor gender pay gap and is trying to increase the number of women at senior management level.Miss Macken\u0027s claims of harassment were dismissed and she lost a claim for damages over the \u0027stigma\u0027 she suffered in this case. As part of her £2 million compensation fee, Miss Macken received £51,400 to cover \u0027pain and suffering\u0027 caused, £35,000 to cover injury to feelings, and £15,000 in \u0027aggravated damages\u0027. More from NewsBoris Johnson latest: Theresa May leads Tory backlash, as No 10 bows to pressure and vows to publish Sue Gray\u0026#39s \u0026#39updated\u0026#39 reportSuspects arrested after two police officers shot dead in GermanyBA.2: omicron subvariant \u0026#39substantially\u0026#39 more transmissible than original, study findsUkraine latest: China says Russia\u0026#39s troop build-up not a \u0026#39threat\u0026#39 as it backs Moscow in UN Security Council meeting\u0026#39Does Boris Johnson think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 Tory MP attacks PM as he recalls grandmother\u0026#39s lockdown funeral while No 10 partiedFormer primary school teacher accused of punching a horse demands jury trialMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir david amess seat deserves proper by election","story":"By-elections to the House of Commons are important affairs, especially when held in the middle of a parliamentary term. They can shake governments, give rise to novel protests and reflect local quirks. They can embody all the vitality and magic of democracy, with previously nailed-on winners defeated, and new, unlikely voices given a national platform. That is unless your MP was recently murdered in office. Then, by new consensus, the normal business of democracy is suspended.This week, my constituency of Southend West will hold a by-election to elect a successor to Sir David Amess, who was killed while conducting a constituency surgery in October last year. I normally love elections and enjoy casting my ballot. But this time, I won\u0027t be voting.Before his murder, Sir David was my MP for all but a few months of my life. I’d volunteered in his office as a schoolboy. I saw him around every so often. He was a constituency MP to his core, and as many of his colleagues and caseworkers attested after his death, he frequently refused to rein in his independence in Parliament in exchange for promotion.I’ve surveyed the campaign literature of Anna Firth, his designated replacement. A smooth-talking barrister, Firth was a parliamentary candidate in London’s Erith and Thamesmead in the 2015 general election, and a candidate for Canterbury in 2019, which she lost with a swing to Labour against the national average. She was for much of the last decade a district councillor in Sevenoaks, in Kent. A loyal party worker then, willing to travel. Good candidates from major parties might have been able to prompt her to say a little more during the campaign. But here’s the problem – none of them are standing. Due to the circumstances of Sir Amess\u0027 death, the election is being vacated to the Tories by other major Westminster parties. It’s going to be a coronation.The parties are treading on eggshells after the murder of one of their own. They did the same after Jo Cox’s murder in 2016. But an uncontested election after the killing of an MP seems less like the dignified suspension of normal politics – and more like deciding arbitrarily that the public won’t bear a contest. Oddballs are normally drawn to by-elections, and this one is no different. My constituency will soon briefly accommodate the electoral tourists Jayda Fransen, formerly of Britain First, and Catherine Blaiklock, the founding leader of the Brexit Party (now Reform UK). You can have some debate between the consensus and the fringe, certainly. But with one candidate anointed by the mainstream, and the rest a bunch of oddities not even expecting to win, how much value can this campaign truly have?There seems no reason why major parties should leave a by-election, even in as safe a seat as Southend West, uncontested – even for sentimental reasons.By-elections are sometimes upsets, and they are often bellwethers of public dissent against the government of the day. It is disappointing to allow so synthetic an election to follow the death of such an independent-minded MP as Sir David.More from NewsWhy you see men in all these objectsBoris Johnson latest: Theresa May leads Tory backlash, as No 10 bows to pressure and vows to publish Sue Gray\u0026#39s \u0026#39updated\u0026#39 reportSuspects arrested after two police officers shot dead in GermanyBA.2: omicron subvariant \u0026#39substantially\u0026#39 more transmissible than original, study findsUkraine latest: China says Russia\u0026#39s troop build-up not a \u0026#39threat\u0026#39 as it backs Moscow in UN Security Council meeting\u0026#39Does Boris Johnson think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 Tory MP attacks PM as he recalls grandmother\u0026#39s lockdown funeral while No 10 partiedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tiktok phenomenon sees book sales skyrocket","story":"The rise of “BookTok” is driving teenagers and young adults into bookshops in numbers not seen since the Harry Potter years, according to the head of Waterstones.Sales of new books are booming after being recommended by influencers on TikTok, the social media app - but some classics are also becoming unlikely viral sensations.“These last three or four weeks in the United States, James Joyce’s Ulysses has been a significant seller because on TikTok the kids are getting excited about it,” said James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones and chief executive of the US chain Barnes \u0026amp Noble.The #BookTok hashtag has had 37.4 billion views and popular influencers tend to be young women, mostly recommending books by female authors.Daunt said they were helping to make bookshops popular with young people, reminding him of the decade from 1997-2007 which saw publication of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series.“It is back to that kind of energy in our stores. Our challenge now is that we absolutely have to keep those customers, as we did with the Harry Potter generation. It stepped booksellers up and it stepped book sales up,” Daunt told a bookselling conference in Italy, reported in The Bookseller.Waterstones runs its own TikTok account as a marketing tool and Daunt explained: “It’s about fun and enjoyment and enthusiasm and the people who do it brilliantly are of the same generation - it’s our young booksellers and we let them get on with it.”He joked: “We have generally found that the people with blue hair do better than the people with sensible haircuts.”Barnes \u0026amp Noble has dedicated a section of its website to books recommended on TikTok. Even WH Smith groups some of its books under the tag “TikTok made me buy it!”Books that have benefited from the TikTok effect include The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Read, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.Hoover’s book sold 21,000 copies on its release in 2016, but sales were reignited at the end of 2020 when TikTokers began posting about it. By summer 2021, according to Publishers Weekly, it had sold 450,000 copies.Sally Rooney’s Normal People and the Hanya Yanagihara novel A Little Life are also frequently recommended. The Barnes \u0026amp Noble list features classic titles The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights.The New York Times reported on the phenomenon with the headline “How Crying on TikTok Sells Books”, noting that tear-jerking novels were particularly popular. One of the most popular British “BookTok” stars is 22-year-old Abby Parker, who has amassed 428,000 followers.Often, Parker’s videos consist of her brandishing a book while a caption runs on screen and a soundtrack plays over it. Her recommendation for The Secret History, Donna Tartt’s 1992 bestseller, said simply: “No because never has an opening line hooked me faster. I’ve never been so excited to start a book.”Parker told Amazon last year: “I’ve always dreamed of sharing my love for books with the world and TikTok has finally been my gateway into doing just that. Getting completely involved with the book community this past year has been truly one of the greatest things I’ve ever done in my life.”The popularity of Ulysses, which many readers find to be impenetrable, is more difficult to explain. However, several TikTokers have introduced Joyce and his novels to a wider audience by discussing the racy letters he wrote to his wife, Nora.Joyce features in a video by Esme Louise James, an Australian PhD candidate who runs an irreverent account called Kinky History.More from NewsBoris Johnson latest: Theresa May leads Tory backlash, as No 10 bows to pressure and vows to publish Sue Gray\u0026#39s \u0026#39updated\u0026#39 reportSuspects arrested after two police officers shot dead in GermanyBA.2: omicron subvariant \u0026#39substantially\u0026#39 more transmissible than original, study findsUkraine latest: China says Russia\u0026#39s troop build-up not a \u0026#39threat\u0026#39 as it backs Moscow in UN Security Council meeting\u0026#39Does Boris Johnson think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 Tory MP attacks PM as he recalls grandmother\u0026#39s lockdown funeral while No 10 partiedFormer primary school teacher accused of punching a horse demands jury trialMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"16 parties investigated sue gray","story":"All  parties investigated by Sue Gray - including  probed by policeSenior civil servant Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the Downing Street lockdown parties, including one allegedly held just hours before the Queen buried Prince Philip aloneBoris Johnson is under pressure after Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the parties Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMatthew DreschNews Reporter:,  Jan |commentsSue Grayaposs report investigated  Downing Street parties, including  being probed by police.

The Prime Minister will spend the weekend at his Chequers retreatBoris is waiting tooopinionByKeir Mudie:,  Jan |commentsI canapost remember ever being so excited over waiting for something to be published.Maybe when I was waiting for the last Rebus to come out . This Sue Gray report is having the same effect. Last thing I check before bed, first thing when I get up. Has it landed  Tragic way to live, really.Westminster is a bit like those books at the moment. I love Ian Rankin but I find myself reading them not for the plots – like I did at the start – but more for what’s been going on with Rebus. And that’s the way things are round here these days. There’s a cost of living crisis coming, war brewing, all sorts of problems, but the most fascinating thing is the psychodrama going on around the PM and Sue Gray.  It was due Thursday, then possibly Friday. Now they reckon it’s due tomorrow. What’s in there, do you think  What’s the hold-up  It seems pretty clear that it’s not going to be good news for the PM. People I speak to in Whitehall tell me they had to change their media lines because it went from “very bad” to “terrible” very quickly. The excitement. Labour is in a slightly tricky position. The bind seems to be, do you want Mr Johnson to stay or keep the pressure on and kick him out  There are two schools of thought. The first is that it would be beneficial to keep him around, kick him repeatedly until the next election and then let him limp into a defeat. The danger with that strategy is thatMr Johnson rides this crisis out we will head into the summer, the Commonwealth Games, the Jubilee celebrations, the weather, and everyone’s mood picks up, and all this becomes a distant memory.  Mr Johnson becomes a good-time PM again. The other danger is that you would be letting a lame duck run the show during an exceptionally dficult time for the country. The other school of thought is that taking a scalp at any time is good. Also,Rishi Sunak is the favourite to take over, it might be quite nice to have him in place. A new billionaire PM – and former hedge fund boss – as we stagger into the cost of living crisis. That’s quite easy to frame for a Labour attack. Anyways. We’ll see. Maybe Tuesday. We are in the hands of Sue Gray, who sounds like she knows what she’s doing and – as civil servants go – is an interesting character. Thorough and no-nonsense are the words used to describe her. Fair is another. Ms Gray used to run a pub in Northern Ireland, which suggests she knows a party when she sees one. And her husband is a country and western singer. Who could not have faith in someone married to a country and western singer  I like that music, which is honest stuff and manages to be very serious while not taking itself too seriously at the same time. I collect some of the funnier titles, like I Wouldn’t Take Her to a Dogfightor You’re A Hard Dog To Keep Under The Porch.

On Tuesday, January , over a dozen Tory MPs are thought to have met to conspire over Boris Johnson’s future in a gathering dubbed as the ‘pork pie plot.’ While some MPs have publicly urged Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties held during the  lockdown, several MPs have reportedly already submitted their no confidence letters to the  Committee chaired by Sir Graham Brady.Here’s what you need to know about a no confidence vote and what will happen next now that the Sue Gray report has been published. How is a vote of no confidence triggered   A vote of no confidence would be triggered% of Tory MPs write to Sir Brady saying they no longer have confidence in Boris Johnson.There were  Tory MPs - prior to Christian Wakefordaposs defection to Labour - this means that  would need to submit letters to trigger the no confidence vote.How many letters have been submitted is a closely guarded secret kept by Sir Graham, but MPs are free to publicly confirmthey have submitted theirs. For instance, veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both confirmed that they had submitted their letters. If the  letters are sent to the  Committee, then a vote is held with a secret ballot of Tory MPs taking place. The MPs will vote in support of or against their leader, andover % of them vote against Johnson, he will be ousted. What would happenBoris Johnson is ousted from his position  If majority votes against Johnson, a leadership contest to choose the countryaposs next leader would get underway immediately in the Conservative Party.Any leader who loses a confidence vote is not allowed to take part in the next leadership contest, so Johnson would not be able to compete. However,he wins the vote of no confidence, his position is secured for a further  months, although  backbenchers are murmuring about changing the rules to bring this down to six months.A general election will only take placehalf of MPs voted against the Government in a separate no confidence motion. Potential candidates for the next prime minister include Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Home Secretary Priti Patel as well as Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.What is the  Committee  The  Committee - formally known as the Conservative Private Members’ Committee - is a group of Tory backbenchers who meet weekly when the Commons is sitting to discuss party matters. Currently chaired by Sir Graham Brady, the MP for Altrincham and Sale West, the purpose of it is to give less senior members of the party an opportunity to discuss any issues. The committee will then have a monthly meeting with the party leader to share the opinions within the party.

The Prime Minister is under huge pressure to vacate his current post after controversy over parties that occurred at No  Downing Street during the height of lockdown. Before Sue Grayaposs findings were released on Monday January , he had already admitted attending one party after previously assuring the House of Commons that he was furious at such behaviour.

It may be one reason that, as the Conservatives face a huge slump in the polls, Tory MPs had decided not to get rid of Johnson just yet. However,the reportaposs findings are indeed damning for the PM, it is unlikely MPs will continue to back him. But as the nine-page report doesnapost go into detail about the parties the Met Police are looking into, Johnson may hang on in there for a few more months.The PM was a key factor behind the large majority won in the  general election, in which the Tories took a host of traditional aposred wallapos seats away from the Labour Party.MPs in those seats may not be keen to see the PM resign, as it is possible they see Johnson as important to their chances of re-election. If the findings do not implicate the PM, it could regain him the support of MPs teetering on the edge of writing a letter of no-confidence.One red wall MP, Christian Wakeford of Bury South, already defected to Labour this month. He has alleged that he was threatened with having funding for a new school in his constituency pulledhe didnapost toe the line on a government vote.What does Sue Grayaposs report say   Ms Grayaposs nine-page report sets out some of her findings - but as the Met Police is also launching an investigation, she hasnapost been able to look in detail at all the separate party allegations.Her update said at least some of the gatherings were a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time. It also revealed Scotland Yard are probing  out of the  parties she investigated - including Boris Johnsonaposs birthday party. But the report was stripped of key details after the Met Police asked Ms Gray to make only minimal reference to  of the gatherings in her report. Ms Gray conceded: I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events. It is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather. Downing Street police officers have been quizzed about the partygate allegations. According to previous reports, their statements have been described as aposextremely damningapos. One source said: Met officers have spoken to Sue Gray now, as you would expect, and have been able to provide a lot of information. Some MPs have criticised that the report is being conducted by Gray, supposedly known for her hard-line stance on ethics in the government. However, Gray is essentially in the position where she is reporting on her own bosses. She also has no power to recommend any punishment by way of resignations. MP Chris Bryant said on Twitter: To be clear, Sue Gray is not aposindependentapos. She may be independently minded. But she’s a civil servant reporting on her boss.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

She spent years being bombarded with messages from Hardy, who created several fake accounts in a bid to harass her. As a result, the mumaposs relationship broke down and she was even unable to enjoy the birth of her third child. Bizarrely, the harassment was triggered by an innocuous five-minute meeting between the pair, which barely registered with Sabrina at the time.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Sabrina, , says: He absolutely ruined my le and dominated my thoughts for five years. He set up accounts pretending to me and sent messages to my friends and family and even my children. He also set up accounts in my friendsapos names and messaged me pretending to be them. The level of research he carried out to discover small details about me was mind-blowing and it made me so afraid that he would hurt me or my family. I hated letting my children out of the house, even to go to school. I barely slept and I was forever checking for him in the street. My le was completely controlled by him. The pair first met in  when Sabrina called in to see a family friend of her late mum, and Hardy was at the house. Sabrina, from Mere, Cheshire, says: I was only at the house to drop something off, I said hello to Matthew and we left it at that. I didnapost think any more of it.But days later, he began messaging me on Facebook and accused me of having an affair with the family friend I had been to visit.I assured him he had got the wrong idea the man was much older than me and married to my mumaposs friend. I thought it was a bit odd and left it at that. But she then received a slew of messages, both from Hardy and from accounts of people Sabrina knew well. In one message, she was accused of having an affair with an ex-boyfriend of her late mum. In another, he suggested she was sleeping with her best friendaposs husband and also with a close male friend. She says: The messages were from accounts of people I was friendly with and at first there was lots of detail and they seemed genuine. Most of the time he would just make conversation before he started making really creepy suggestions. At first, I thought my friends were turning against me. It was really upsetting and confusing. One year on, Sabrina learned that Hardy had previously been convicted of harassment over social media and she became suspicious. Sabrina, who runs fitness and pole dancing classes, says: I went to the police, but I didnapost feel they took me seriously. They suggested I try blocking him but of course, he had so many fake accounts in dferent names, and I didnapost know which were my genuine friends and which were him. He was by this stage messaging my friends and work colleagues from a fake account he had set up in my name, so evenclosed my social media down he was still able to stalk me. I had no idea what he was saying to people about me and it was very embarrassing. The level of information he was able to gather about me was frightening. He was very clever and manipulative and messaged students from my fitness class, and even the studio owner. He delved into my past to find people Iaposd lost touch with. He seemed to know everything about me. I became scared for my safety and for my children, I was constantly checking the street before we went out. I was on high alert all the time. I was so desperate that I even contacted Hardy directly, and his mother, to ask to be left alone. I asked him why he was stalking me, but he couldnapost give me an answer. In February , Sabrina had a daughter, Nancy, but the birth was ruined by the constant harassment from Hardy. Sadly, her relationship broke down too under the strain. She says: I suffer with endometriosis and the stress caused by Hardy made it so much worse. He was affecting my health mentally and physically. I contacted the police on several occasions and finally last year the case was taken up by PC Kevin Anderson rom Northwich Local Policing Unit who was absolutely wonderful. I was horried to find out that Hardy had targeted many other women as well as me. Matthew Hardy appeared before Chester Crown Court earlier this month in relation with the harassment against Sabrina and other women, and was jailed for nine years. He had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of stalking with intent to cause alarm or distress, two counts of stalking without intent to cause alarm and breaching a restraining order from , which banned him from using  details on social networking sites. He also admitted stalking a further four women, which was taken into consideration upon sentencing. Following the sentencing, Police Constable Kevin Anderson from Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: Having led on this case for more than  months I have seen the emotional distress and turmoil that Hardy has inflicted on his victims - he did all of this while hiding behind his computer screen. The impact on those affected by his actions has been immense, causing some of them to change some of their daily habits, and live in constant fear that they were being watched. On other occasions, it caused them to lose trust in their friends and family members, and even led to the breakdown of long-term relationships. Thankfully, Hardy has now been held accountable for his actions, and his online activity has finally been brought to a stop. I hope that the conclusion of this case will provide some closure for his victims and enable then to rebuild and move forward with their lives.

Omicron iant and symptoms - all you need to knowDespite Covid Plan B restrictions easing in the UK and cases gradually dropping, a new coronavirus BA. iant is said to be spreading faster than Omicron. Heres everything you need to know about the virus sub-strainEverything you need to know about the new Omicron mutant BA. Covid iant Image: Getty ImagesBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments On Saturday January , the UK recorded another , coronavirus cases within  hours, a decline from , a week prior. And, despite a range of Covid Plan B restrictions being relaxed on January , there are growing concerns surrounding the Omicron iant sub-strain that is believed to be more infectious than its predecessor.Omicron caused havoc across the UK as it led to a huge rise in positive Covid cases from November, , leaving fears of Christmas being cancelled due to a lockdown for a second year.As the wave continues to ease, a new Omicron aposstealth iantapos is emerging and is believed to have been identied at least  times in the UK since November. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the BA. iant, including what the UK Health Security Agencyhas said it is and what the symptoms may be. What is the BA. new Covid iant in the UK and is it more dangerous than Omicron  The BA. Covid strain is thought to be an Omicronsub-strain with a higher growth rate, which can potentially be more easily transmissible, according to the UKHSA. The new strain of Covid is currently also being referred to as the aposStealth Variantapos and has been identied in India, parts of Europe, South Africa, the US and the UK.  Despite it being dubbed a aposstealthapos iant thataposs supposedly not identiable on tests, this claim is  as it can be detected by lateral flowand PCR tests. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, explained: We now know that BA. has an increased growth rate which can be seen in all regions in England. We have also learnt that BA. has a slightly higher secondary attack rate than BA. in households. Although hospitalisations and deaths remain low, cases are still high in some areas and some age groups so it’s important that we continue to act cautiously as restrictions are lted.  While the majority of cases of the virus are believed to be in Denmark, experts in the country donapost see it as cause for concern. Anders Fomsgaard, chief physician and virus researcher at the Statens Serum Institut , told Danish media: We cannot see any dference in hospitalisation numbers, death rates with BA., so it is not something that worries us yet.” Adding: Right now we should just treat it as yet another iant until new data should eventually show other results.  Despite this highly transmissible iant stemming from Omicron, the World Health Organisation is yet to identy Omicron as a iant of concern. More information will be gathered over time, as researchers study the new strain. However, experts have advised for eligible people across the UK to get all three Covid vaccinations to increase protection against the virus. How long does Covid vaccine and booster jab immunity last for With the UK rapidly ramping up booster jab vaccinations as Omicron became a dominant Covid iant, many vaccinated Brits were able to avoid more severe coronavirus side effects. However, with cases still being reported and the new BA. strain emerging, many are concerned about how protected theyaposll be against the mutation. The UKHSA has stated that three doses of the vaccine are % effective at preventing symptomatic infections by the new Omicron BA. sub-strain, while the same number of doses are % effective against the original Omicron BA. strain.  However, experts have not officially stated how many days, weeks or months you are immune against Covid for per dose. What are the confirmed Omicron symtpoms  With BA. being a sub-strain of the original BA. Omicron iant, the symptoms are likely to be similar.While new Omicron symptoms may be identied over time, none have been outlined yet. In the meantime, you should continue to look out for the following Covid symptoms, according to the ZOE Covid Study and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention :Congested or runny nose HeadacheFatigueNew or continuous coughShortness of breath or dficulty breathing Muscle or body aches New loss of taste or smell Sore throatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaIf you do find you have one or more of these symptoms, you should take a Covid test immediately and self-isolate to avoid spreading the virus to others around you.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iantCoronavirus vaccineMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

Tillie Adams, , is one of an estimated , under-s suffering with the long-term effects of the virus in the UK - with , ill for more than a year. During her  month ordeal Tillie has spent weeks in hospital and is often too ill to go to school.Her weight plummeted dangerously as she struggled to eat after falling ill with coronavirus last January, and she still suffers from debilitating sickness a year later.After her condition baffled medics for months, the schoolgirl was eventually told she had Post Covid Infection Syndrome, and has had a NG tube, which provides vital nutrients, since last summer. Long Covid is thought to affect around one in  children under the age of , while . per cent of those aged  to  are believed to have it.  Tillie, who now struggles to walk up the stairs at her home in Hoxton, east London, and has fainted several times in recent months, said: Sometimes I get so angry, I want to go to school, but itaposs just so hard, some days I canapost because Iaposm just so tired and so washed out. When she was first diagnosed with Covid she suffered with a temperature, aches and pains and lost her smell and taste.Her mum Kelly was told that Tillie should start to feel better within a fortnight, but weeks later she was still suffering from headaches, stomach pains and dficulty eating.Tillie, who used to be full of energy and enjoyed playing outside before she became ill, said: I just felt confused, I was just so scared, I didnapost know what to do. At first Iaposd just stay in bed because I was scared to move.  She spent two weeks in hospital after losing a stone in a matter of weeks as medics desperately tried to work out what was wrong. The more weight she was losing, the weaker she became, said Kelly, . She went grey and her lips split open, it was awful. It took a month before her energy levels picked up. She couldnapost manage the stairs, she was sometimes falling up the stairs and when she got to the top she was so light headed she would almost faint. She still gets those effects now. Sheaposs like a totally dferent child. At first Tillie was unable to dress herself, and she still needs help washing her hair.  Tillie, who is now helping researchers at University College Hospital in London understand Long Covid in children, was initially told she would only require an NG tube for two weeks. But nine months later she is still using one as she makes a phasedto school, aiming to do a half day five days a week. Brave Tillie missed out on much of her final year at primary school, but is desperate not to fall behind during her y recovery. She wants to push herself and she wants to be at school, said Kelly. But theyaposve told her she wonapost be able to go back to school full time until at least Year . Since October sheaposs only managed three weeks where sheaposs managed five half days. The rest of the time sheaposs in bed, sheaposs so washed out.  Sheaposs really worried about falling behind, but she knows that this could go on for years.Determined to show that Covid isnapost just a virus that affects adults, and keen to show others going through a similar ordeal that they are not alone, Tillie last year set up an Instagram account documenting her journey.It has amassed thousands of followers and the family have been inundated with messages of goodwill. She said: Itaposs been amazing. I want to raise awareness for others so they knowthey have it theyaposre not alone. The night before speaking to The Mirror, Tillie had spoken to another girl who was having an NG tube fitted.  Kelly said: At first I was really nervous, but she said: aposI want to help people in the same position and show that kids are suffering tooapos. Children are often forgotten about, you donapost see anything about kids with Long Covid, but when we were in hospital I spoke to lots of other parents who were going through the same thing. Latest figures from the Office for National Statisticsestimates that , children with Long Covid had to limit their activity a little in December, while , were severely restricted. It is believed that around . million people of all ages had Long Covid at the end of last year - just under two per cent of the population. Sammie Mcfarland, founder of charity Long Covid Kids, said the organisation is supporting just under , families across the UK, with numbers rising steeply. Last week alone more than  registered for support, she said. Itaposs getting worse, Sammie told The Mirror, adding that she is aware of several children who require NG tubes after contracting Covid. There are a lot of children with issues like Tillieaposs. We urgently need GP training in recognising Long Covid and we need a strong awareness campaign that accepts children are experiening Covid harm. Weaposre not seeing large numbers of people saying theyaposre back to  per cent, many children arenapost getting any better at all. That for me is the largest concern.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British Medical JournalEducationHospitalsSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her mum, Debbie , pushed for more answers, believing she had a food intolerance and eventually in November last year, Dulcie was given a scan. A biopsy the following month revealed she had stage  Neuroblastoma - an aggressive form of cancer which had spread to her pelvis, bone marrow, legs and spine. Dulcie is now going through intense chemotherapy in a bid to save her le. Mum of one, Debbie, said: The diagnosis was such a shock. Our entire world has crashed around us and never in a million years did we suspect it was cancer. We had never heard of Neuroblastoma. Dulcieaposs parents say doctors have not told them how likely Dulcie is to survive and the youngster is now on her fth round of chemotherapy. The mum from Telford, Shropshire, said: Doctors have told us that the cancer is treatable but I want parents to know the signs becausewe had known sooner what Dulcie was suffering with, it may not have spread so aggressively through her body. We were completely unaware that her symptoms could be something so le-threatening and all we can do now is pray doctors have still caught it in time. The scan found a cancerous mass measuring cm by cm in her stomach.  Debbie said: Neuroblastoma is the second most aggressive cancer in children. We need to stop the tumour in her stomach growing and spreading further around her body. Doctors are also looking at surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible - after she has completed seven rounds of chemotherapy. Debbie added: The symptoms I want to make other parents aware of include a swollen tummy, constipation. It can cause children to walk quite unsteadily and have a weakness in their legs. A loss of energy, weight loss and loss of appetite are all signs too. I want to raise as much awareness as possible of this terrible disease because it was easily mistaken for something . The family have also launched a £, fundraising appeal to pay for lesaving treatment in the US.Debbie added: The treatment plan for Dulcie in the UK is for  to  months, itaposs a long road to recovery and could take two years to be in remission. There is the potential that she will never be cancer-free because of the type of cancer it is. If the treatment in the UK doesnapost work, the family could then need to take Dulcie to America. Debbie said: We have started to fundraise for this possibility now because we need to know we have enough funds for the treatment in the US. It would need to start  days after the end of the treatment here, so we canapost risk having to fundraise closer to the time and not having the money to take her. Whilst we hope going to America wonapost be necessary, we have to be prepared to do everything possible for our little girl. If in  months we are in the position that we wonapost require this lesaving trip then any funds raised will be either passed to another family who does need it or donated to several childhood cancer charities. For now, the family are taking each day as it comes and focusing on Dulcieaposs chemotherapy. Debbie said: Dulcie is a superstar, she smiles through it even when she is tired and she bounces back. She is very grown-up for her age, she knows she has cancer but she asks questions that I canapost answer, she wants to know why she has cancer.  It breaks my heart to see her going through this. I have my good and bad days, but her strength gives me strength and most days she is coping really well. Debbie added: When we got the diagnoses I cried in disbelief, how can my daughter have cancer  We have gone through every emotion possible, thinking why was it not spotted sooner. You donapost think it will ever happen to your child, it is a rare cancer but GPs and parents need to recognise the symptoms andyou have any concerns, push for more tests.

Matt, , from Wrexham, Wales, told the Daily Star : “After reading about her history with the house fire, I knew I wanted to buy her.”After buying Annie two years ago, Matt experienced a host of strange incidents including the doll trying to set itself on fire.  He claims its previous owners appeared next to her in images and witnessed the doll crying acid tears. The supernatural fan spotted Annie at an auction in the US and was keen to buy her. But the doll did not cost a huge amount of money and Matt fitted her with monitoring equipment to detect any paranormal activity which was happening.  He said: “She cost me £. After I had her imported to the UK, I had paranormal equipment installed into her as I thought her previous owners’ spirits would be attached to her. “It wasn’t until last year that Annie actually started to cry. “I believe that when she cries it is her ‘attachments’ way of showing emotions. He says the dollaposs weeping followed the death of her owners who are in denial that they have passed away. This he claims means they are aposdemonsapos who will not let go of their former lives. “Annie’s tears are acidic which is demonic. As her previous owners haven’t accepted that they are dead, it means they are classed as demons.”  Matt revealed: “Annie is now kept in a glass box and is under -hour surveillance because she keeps trying to set herself on fire. “Every now and then her clothes get a little bit more singed and charred, and her face is much darker now. “Annie loves fire and last year, each of my five team members, all had something to do with fire happen to their house – all on the same day.”  The doll has been compared with horror movie toys Chucky and Annabelle who have terried cinema goers for decades and the horror continues to intrigue them. Matt said people are clamouring to see a a hunted doll similar to ones they have witnessed in films. He said: “Annie is very popular with people who come and visit our HQ.  “Some people love the thrill of knowing there is a real haunted doll in front of them. “However, some people have walked in the door and walked straight back out again after seeing her. She gives off a really negative vibe.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SupernaturalHouse fires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Maddie disappeared from the resort in  and hasnapost been seen since. Her family still hope she will be found alive. The German TV channel SAT. documentary claims that Brueckner, , was very familiar with Ocean Club, as well as surrounding parts of the Algarve. When Maddie disappeared from the hotel room where her parents had left her, the rapist was no more than five minutes away - phone data analyses by SAT. suggests. In letters reportedly from Brueckner, who is currently in prison for raping a pensioner, he admits to trafficking drugs in a battered hippy van around the time of the disappearance.  He denies claims that he abducted Maddie however, suggesting to do so would be absurd... as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken. He wrote: I was never caught by the police because I followed a few key principles. Where possible, only driving during the day so that my battered hippy bus didnapost attract attention, only driving on the roads I needed to and, most importantly never provoking the police. So that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone. Brueckner was named as the prime suspect in the Maddie case in  by German prosecutors. They remain convinced he was responsible for the youngsteraposs disappearance, but have not brought any charges despite an intense investigation. Brueckner claims he is happy to sit back and relax and just wait for their findings.  His lover at the time, Nicole Fehlinger, , says he told her he liked the bodies of pre-pubescent girls. The documentary also makes claims that Brueckner swapped child abuse images and depraved online messages with an undertaker. The mortician gave “a full confession” when quizzed by German police and admitted he was a “regular customer” of the convicted paedophile. It is understood material he handed over to officers now forms part of evidence being used against Brueckner. The undertaker, also a convicted sex offender, cannot be named for legal reasons – but he has spoken to the makers of a new documentary about the case, being shown tomorrow night on German TV channel Sat.. The film’s lead investigator Jutta Rabe told the Sunday People: “I’m not sure what he paid but he confirmed they regularly swapped material, all of which he has handed over to detectives. We haven’t been able to confirmthey were business partners but he insisted he... has completely mended his ways.” The undertaker, who lives alone, said he was interviewed by the BKA – Germany’s FBI. Miss Rabe said: “He was given a choice, ‘You either admit it and help us then go into therapy or go to prison’. He chose co-operation.” The TV documentary also includes a reconstruction of the evening of the toddleraposs disappearance. It will be screened in Germany later today.

The -year-old says she was in so much pain last month she asked for ­guidance about how to legally end her own le. Roseanna said: It sent me to a very dark place. I contacted Euthanasia UK. I asked how I could legally do this is Scotland. Roseanna tearfully admitted: I said to my husband, aposI have had enough of fightingapos. When I was going to the doctoraposs after my op, I wasnapost believed. They told me it was all in my head and even told my husband Brendan aposDonapost get roped into thisapos.  Roseanna believes that her mesh has moved within her, but she claims a doctor told her the issue was in her head. She first began suffering from health problems in , when the otherwise fit and active mum-of-three felt a sharp stabbing pain. Her GP said she had an umbilical herniation and sent her to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, where she was told no op was needed and to work on her abdominal muscle. The pain worsened two weeks later and she ed to her GP. A hospital surgeon told her he would need to operate and would use pig skin and dissolvable stitches - something they described as the gold standard treatment - and that she would be back in the gym in three weeks. There was no mention of using mesh to carry out the repair. The first indication of complications came when Roseanna suffered a heart rate of more than  beats per minute following the operation. She said: I now know it was a sign of the mesh being rejected by my body. At pm that night my husband was told they couldnapost stabilise my heart and they didnapost knowI was going to make it. Her sons Ryan, William and Cameron said goodbye just in case. From day one she was in excruciating pain, and it hasnapost improved since. She said: I got sent to pain specialists and my GP was constantly writing to the surgeon to say he would have to review me but the surgeon kept cancelling appointments. It was  months after the operation before I met with him again. He told me there was nothing wrong with me and whatever I had was nothing to do with the operation. I was so upset but he grabbed me by the arm and put me out his room. Roseanna asked for a second opinion in  and only then discovered the use of mesh in her op. She has been in and out of hospital regularly since, and has been diagnosed with ing neurological disorder, fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia – sudden, severe facial pain. Roseanna explained: The mesh is compromising my nerves and sending wrong signals back to the brain. A surgeon offering a second opinion told her the mesh was causing her problems and needed to be removed. He could not perform the operation himself, but vowed to find someone who could. Now Roseanna is awaiting surgery, which has not taken place because of the problems she now has with her heart. She said: The longer itaposs in, the more dficult it is to remove it because it merges with your skin and the longer it is in, the worse my condition is getting. Roseanna has launched a campaign calling for the suspension of mesh in hernia operations, with a petition which is going through the public ­petitions committee at Holyrood. To date, more than  patients or their families have written to the committee about their experiences with hernia mesh implants. Labouraposs health spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, who campaigned for vaginal mesh ops to be suspended, called for an urgent review of the uses of mesh for other procedures. She said: It has taken years for the serious problems caused for women who had transvaginal mesh used in their surgical treatment to be resolved but it appears to be affecting other conditions too. She warned: We canapost repeat the mistakes of the past. Roseanna added: I would like for mesh never to be used again but our petition is asking for its use to be suspended until there are proper guidelines. She wants the use of mesh devices and stitches to be suspended while a review of surgical procedures which implant any form of polyester, ­polypropylene or titanium – such as for hernias and hysterectomies – is carried out and guidelines established. Roseanna also called for all GP surgeries to have someone trained in mesh complications so people get the treatment and pain relief they need. Ironically, she campaigned with a friend treated with vaginal mesh for an end to that ­procedure, little realising the product was causing her own symptoms. After years of campaigns the Scottish Government completed a review into vaginal mesh implants used in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence in women. Complications included pain during intercourse, bowel and bladder ­perforations, crippling nerve damage, lelong pain and mobility problems. In  the Scottish ­Government suspended the use of mesh for all but exceptional ­circumstances but its use was not halted until . The Scottish Government said two reviews were commissioned after concerns over mesh use in hernia repair. A spokeswoman said: The evidence supports the continued use of mesh in a iety of abdominal wall and groin hernia but of course, patient preference should be a key consideration. She said health boards were told to ask that alternative procedures be ­considered for those who wish them. Whilst transvaginal mesh is halted, some other procedures which use mesh are complex and long ­established, with few,any, viable alternatives. To suspend their use would leave a cohort of people with limited or no treatment options.

The surrounding area of the house was cordoned off after the incident. Luckily, no injuries were reported as a result of the roof and its tiles falling onto the pavement below.On Saturday, the day the roof was ripped off, yellow and amber weather warnings for high winds had been issued across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Tragically, three people died over the weekend as a result of Storm Malik’s gale-force winds. A nine-year-old boy, from Staffordshire, and a -year-old woman, from Aberdeen, were both killed by falling trees on Saturday. A -year-old man also died after a lorry overturned on the M. Around , homes across northern England and Scotland have been left without power in the wake of Storms Malik and Corrie over the weekend. Schools across Aberdeenshire were forced to close on Monday, as a result of power outages or storm damage. A -year-old hospitality worker, from Northumberland, has been without heating and electricity since Saturday morning. Clare Stirling-Turnbull said: “We have no electric, no heating or hot water - we do have a wood burner so can heat one room.Clare is unable to go to relatives’ houses, as one of the children in her family of six is currently isolating with Covid-.On Sunday night, gusts of mph were recorded at Stornoway in the Western Isles, which forecasters described as exceptionally strong. Met Office meteorologist, Alex Burkill, said: There is no wonder there were signicant impacts such as power outages and damage to buildings.It is very unfortunate that things were worse than that for some people.

Danielle Nicholls and former footballer Dean Holden faced the devastating heartache after spending nine hours waiting for a delayed flight to Lanzarote. They arrived on the Canary Island exhausted from the y journey but there was something not right with their daughter Cici. She was not her usual self, but there was aposnothing particularly tellingapos to warn the family about what would unfold.It had all been a bit of a perfect storm for us because weaposd travelled on the plane, Danielle told the Manchester Evening News. She was exhausted and really lethargic, but we put that down to her being  months and that weaposd been travelling all that time. We woke up once with her in the night and she was a little bit warm. We gave her a bit of Calpol, changed her nappy and put her back in bed. But by the time we got up the next morning we knew she wasnapost right. The couple found fame in the late s when Danielle became the face of CITV along with Stephen Mulhearn, while former footballer Dean was breaking into the first team at Bolton Wanderers. Dean enjoyed a career in the Football League, including a spell as captain of Oldham Athletic and Danielle scaled back her career to spend time raising their three young children - Joey, Ellis and Cici.  But after the family arrived in Lanzarote and Cici took a drink of water, her condition quickly deteriorated. She was rushed to a clinic on the island, where a helicopter was waiting to take her to the nearest intensive care unit. Within three hours, Cici had died. Thataposs whataposs scary for people I think - how quickly it can develop, said Danielle. She was our most laid back, chilled out kid. She had bright red hair and blue eyes, and she was dead unique looking - she looked like something out of the olden days because I used to dress her up in frills and that. Iaposd waited ages to have my little girl.Cici had suffered meningococcal septicemia - a bacterial infection which causes blood poisoning, leading to sepsis.Her death on May , , was just the beginning of the trauma and torment that would scar Danielle and Dean. The couple had to make arrangements to fly their dead daughter home, facing reluctance from airlines who feared it would aposupset other passengersapos. Danielle added: Sheaposd never, ever left my side, she hadnapost even stayed at grandmaaposs. It felt like I was in a horror movie. I canapost be scared by a horror movie anymore because my actual le was that frightening.  To hold your dead kid in your arms for two hours when she had died, just because I couldnapost let go of her. Danielle and Dean ed from the hospital to the villa, where Joey and Ellis had been staying with the presenteraposs sister Jodie and Deanaposs brother Matt. They broke the news to their young sons, then aged four and three, and the process of trying to come to terms with the tragedy began. I canapost remember the first days and weeks after she died because youaposre just in some kind of trance, said Dean.  The biggest thing is your personality just completely changes overnight - and then you start behaving in a way you never have before. Thataposs hard because people start saying aposoh youaposre not the person you used to beapos and you start fighting against it. Youaposre in your own head all the time. Having already suffered the heartache of losing their young daughter, Danielle and Dean were left fearing the worst when Ellis came down with a raging temperature on the following night. He was unwell for a couple of days but thankfully recovered. After ing to Worsley, Greater Manchester, the couple say they were only offered anti-depressants from their GP and decided against taking them.  Instead, they embarked on a process involving group therapy, hypnotherapy and a raft of coping mechanisms such as meditation and exercise, to stop them becoming aposjibbering wrecksapos. The emotional strain from what happened caused huge damage to the coupleaposs mental health and post-traumatic stress disordertook hold. Danielle said: Weaposre all very independent, weaposre all living our lives without community, which is OK until we forget there are still tragedies happening in peopleaposs lives. There would have been a time where I would talk about it and then I could feel ill for a week afterwards, said Danielle. We did that initially because we were in the spotlight, and it made us ill. Danielle and Dean struggled as they spoke to others and relived the death of their much-loved daughter. The couple say some were aposabruptapos to them, asking why they didnapost act dferently when Cici was ill, while others would cross the road to avoid speaking to them. Their experience has inspired them to be open and honest about what happened to Cici, rather than keeping quiet with a aposstf upper lipapos mentality. The couple found solace from a support group in Warrington for bereaved parents, known as Compassionate Friends, where they shared their experiences with other couples who had gone through the heartbreaking loss of a child. Dean was supported by the Professional Footballersapos Association, who helped him to see a psychotherapist. I think unless we all start talking about the bad things in le, people will feel like we felt - we felt like aliens. As they were coming to terms with the sudden loss of Cici, they still had to find work to keep providing for their two sons.  Dean had just been released by Rochdale and was approaching clubs for playing opportunities.For Danielle, who had been working on a freelance basis, Ciciaposs death came before she had been due to meet with the BBC about work on Bitesize .He said: Iaposd been to see counsellors, and it was useless, so I went to see a psychotherapist and learned how the brain works post-trauma. Iaposd be screwed without that, because I needed to understand why Iaposd gone from being this chilled out bloke to all of a sudden this raging lunatic.Danielle, Joey and Ellis, meanwhile, were supported by the charity Meningitis Now - with the boys having innovative art therapy and anger management sessions, while Danielle also had therapy sessions.The family say they donapost know where they would be without the help of Meningitis Now, which has recently asked the couple to become ambassadors for the charity. With collections at Deanaposs old football clubs Oldham, Bolton, Chesterfield, Shrewsbury and Walsall, they raised funds to give back to Meningitis Now and to fund sensory support equipment for their childrenaposs school. Only now, almost a decade since Ciciaposs death, do they feel able to be a strong voice for the charity. Danielle said: Every day you do the work. It doesnapost matter how long it is. When your kid dies, you never feel any less pain, no matter how much timeaposs gone by. Itaposs just like you learn to live with the pain. Now is the time that I want to say to people, itaposs OK to not be OK, but by being that person - not just by saying it. I know what itaposs like to have that missing part of you thataposs never going to come back.  Just taking the chance to say - I was that girl off kids TV, I had a kid died and everything went to s***, and Iaposve got mental health issues - but itaposs OK. Since Ciciaposs death, Dean and Danielle have gone on to have two more children - with eight-year-old Mitzi and three-year-old Chase joining Joey and Ellis, now aged  and  respectively. Cici is always in the familyaposs minds - with photos of the toddler put up in their Worsley home as well as in a bracelet on Danielleaposs wrist. Dean said: If there was a drug to erase Cici out of our memory - we would have lost  months of incredible memories, but they were outweighed by the pain. As you get through the therapy, that changes - now thereaposs no way weaposd ever want to forget her because we can manage the pain. We talk about Cici so much, thereaposs a massive picture of her at the top of the stairs. People will ask how many kids we have got, and itaposs a conversation wrecker but we donapost know any other way to address it, weaposll say weaposve had five but weaposve only got four. Then they feel horrible for asking, butwe just say weaposve got four we might as well just brush her out of our le. The couple use techniques like meditation, deep breathing and cold water immersion to help with their mental health ever day to avoid aposgoing to a dark placeapos. They are big advocates for therapy and the methods they have used to help them live with the pain of losing Cici. Although panic attacks can still take the couple back to the horrors of the day she died, they now feel able to bring their mental health back under control and avoid aposspirallingapos. Dean said: If Iaposm late for something, Iaposm going back to the day Cici died. I start shaking, I start panicking - and Iaposm just late, but my brain doesnapost know the dference. Weaposve spent a lot of time with a lot of good people, but there are ways of resetting by doing strategies - tapping, cold showers and whatever. “We do all kinds of weird and wonderful things that work. Dean and Danielle suffered yet more loss after Ciciaposs death, with five miscarriages in the years between Mitzi and Chase being born. Covid brought added strain - with lockdown robbing the family of their coping mechanisms following Ciciaposs death, while Deanaposs work at Bristol City kept him away from home. But now, the pair are looking forward to a bright future with their careers.Having done live Twitch streams online for gaming on the BiigNoobs channel in recent months, Danielle is hoping to get back on TV and radio, with work in the pipeline.She also took on a comedy course last summer to try a completely new experience. Danielle said: I love making people laugh, I didnapost realise how much Iaposd enjoy it. Itaposs good - but Iaposm proper scared before I go up. Iaposm doing open mics and stuff because I want to learn the trade - I want to get a bit of cred from the other comedians. Dean added: When she goes in front of a camera or goes on stage, her eyes light up. Thataposs what she was born to do. Meanwhile, having left his role at Bristol City last season, Dean is now much closer to home as assistant manager for Stoke City. Having lived through so much pain over the past decade, the couple say they are grateful for what they have, and are looking forward to the next chapter. Danielle said: Weaposve had so much sadness and tragedy, but it doesnapost mean that weaposre miserable people who donapost have a laugh, in fact quite the opposite.

Later on Sunday, Daniel Ek, CEO of Spoty, said: We know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users. In that role, it is important to me that we donapost take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.

The Tig was Meghanaposs successful lestyle blog that she ran before marrying Prince Harry while an actress on the hit legal drama Suits. It also included interviews with her celebrity friends including Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra.She shut down the site in  - just months before her engagement to Harry was announced. However, according to the Daily Mail, LA lawyer Marjorie Witter Norman filed a new application to trademark the blogaposs name in July last year, according to legal records.  It was filed under a Delaware-based holding company called Frim Fram Inc, linked to Meghanaposs business manager Andrew Meyer. Itaposs a move that has raised hopes that Meghan - who stepped down as a working royal along with Harry in March  - may one-day re-launch the blog. Here, we take a look back at some of Meghanaposs most candid posts on The Tig... Constant battle Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. In a post to mark her rd birthday in , Meghan opened up about her younger years - before she shot to international fame - giving an insight into her le. She called the post Birthday Suit and accompanying the post was a beautul image of Meghan - appearing to not be wearing a top.She wrote: My s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool as hip as smart as aposwhateverapos as everyone . Meanwhile, Meghan also talked in the post about her teenage years and trying to fit in at school. She added: My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls. Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. She said every day at lunch she would keep herself busy with school societies like French club and a student body that took place between noon and pm so she wouldnapost have to eat on her own. But she recalled a breakthrough moment in her le when attending an audition in her mid-s. She explained: I must have been about  when a casting director looked at me during an audition and said aposYou need to know that you’re enough. Less makeup, more Meghanapos. Unladylike habits  In another candid post, Meghan made a confession about struggling to give up unladylike habits as part of her New Yearaposs resolutions - just months before she met Prince Harry. She wrote: Run a marathon. Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing. Re-learn French. These make my New Year’s resolution list nearlysingle year.The marathon hasnapost happened. The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple of drinks.Then thereaposs the French – a language I studied through high school and then lost as I immersed myself in speaking Spanish with the Argentinians during my stint in Buenos Aires.I have put my little Rosetta Stone headset in my eager ears every year, resolving to do interviews en français, but much to my chagrin, it hasnapost stuck.And when it comes to the biting of the nails – well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day. Itaposs unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit.Sweet tribute to dad  Meghanaposs relationship with her estranged father Thomas has been strained for many years.Itaposs thought the pair havenapost seen each other since she married Harry and he is yet to meet his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet.However, when Meghan was running her blog, it seemed she was close to her dad and wrote a gushing post about him revealing the heartwarming present he once bought her for Christmas.She explained how her hardworking daddy went to Toys R Us to buy a boxed set of Barbie dolls which she had been yearning for - at a time she was struggling with her biracial identity. However there was a problem - they either came as a black family or a white one. So when at Toys R Us faced with the boxes of Barbies in front of him, Thomas aposbroke the rulesapos and took them apart to make a custom family for his little girl. Meghan recalled: When I was about seven, I had been fawning over a boxed set of Barbie dolls.  It was called The Heart Family and included a mom doll, a dad doll, and two children. This perfect nuclear family was only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. I don’t remember coveting one over the other, I just wanted one. On Christmas morning, swathed in glitter-flecked wrapping paper, there I found my Heart Family: a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family. I picture him standing there in Toys R Us, moms glaring at him for taking the toys apart, perhaps an employee saying aposexcuse me sir, you can’t do thatapos — as my dad carefully separated the boxed sets to make one that echoed my reality. One that showed me that I shouldmake my own box. Post about Kate Middleton  In a twist of a fate, Meghan also blogged about the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs wedding - seven years before her own royal wedding.She wrote the pomp surrounding Kate and Williamaposs  wedding and how she grew up dreaming of becoming a princess.A section published by The Sun states: Little girls dream of being princesses. I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power.For those of you unfamiliar with the aposs cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength.Weaposre definitely not talking about Cinderella here.Grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the royal wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.Juggling celebrity le  In one of Meghanaposs most popular posts, Meghan offered her candid thoughts on how to juggle celebrity le with giving back and doing her day job.The ,-word post was published in October , months after starting her relationship with Prince Harry.I’m consistently asked how I keep a foot in two contrasting worlds – one in the entertainment industry, predicated on wealth and indulgence, and the other in humanitarian work.To me, it’s less of a question of how can you do this, and more a question of how can you not, Meghan wrote.She also describes her upbringing in Los Angeles, Calornia, with her free-spirited clinical therapist mom and the most hardworking father you can imagine, and how, even at , she wanted to become an independent, strong woman.Meghan added: While my le shts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist. And for me, they must. My eleven year old self would be proud, because while I may not have realized it at the time, I, in fact, have always had a foot in the world of entertainment as well as the world of public service my le now is simply a more heightened version of the very reality in which I grew up. And, truth be told, it’s the most beautul gt I never knew I always had.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The employee, who posts on TikTok under the username @nnennaaaaa, shared a video from a recent sht at the fast-food chain in which they served up a large portion of fries in the signature McDonaldaposs box - but admitted they purposefully pinched the bottom of the box so that fewer fries would fit in.

Inbaal Honigman, , calls on planetary forces to make her predictions - looking to the moon for guidance. The psychic of more than  years lives in West Yorkshire with her husband and four kids. She said: “New moons are a really important time of the month because they symbolise new beginnings, soyou’re seeing someone for a first date then you’re going to skew the odds slightly in your favour by planning it for the new moon.“We’re in a dferent sign each month so, for this month, the new moon we have is in Aquarius.“Aquarius is a sign for intellectual pursuits, soyou plan a first date for the Aquarius new moon, which is on February , then to skew it further in your favour, plan a date to the opera or a museum, something that involves an intellectual activity.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Inbaal, originally from Israel, says she grew up in a family where no one held strong spiritual beliefs like her. “I was raised not believing in mystical stuff, she said. As a family, we went to synagogue once a year to keep my great grandad happy, but I had no spiritual leads at all. “Still, I always knew I had some sort of spiritual gt. At school, when a teacher asked a question, I would always know the answer. Everyone thought I was just a clever girl, but it was stuff I had no prior knowledge of. “If we played a game of aposWhat’s under the cups apos or aposWhich hand am I holding an item in apos I always got it right. When she left Israel at  years old, Inbaal says she discovered tarot cards - and she reckons her predictions have come true on several occasions.  During the financial crash, I somehow managed to sell my flat in London to move to Yorkshire and made the move just four days before I gave birth to my firstborn. I was also told I was infertile, but managed to conceive my first two children naturally. I manested my little family.Since first becoming a psychic in , Inbaalaposs career has skyrocketed and sheaposs now a regular on TV - appearing on Stephaposs Packed Lunch on Channel . Using the moon to guide her love predictions, Inbaal said:Pisces is one of the most romantic signs, so a very romantic day this year is September , the Pisces full moon. This would be a very good day for a proposal.Each day of the week can also influence romance, as they are all named after gods and goddesses, according to Inbaal. She said: Friday is named after Freyja, the goddess of love, and is the perfect day to plan a first date. You really increase your chances of getting a second date by picking a Friday. Tuesday is named after Mars, they are war gods so not a good time for a first date, but perhaps a good time for a hook-up, because the energies are fiery.Did you fall in love in an unusual or unexpected way  Get in touch at jessica.taylor@reachplc. She added: “Saturday is named after Saturn, which is a very serious and mature god. It’s a time to make big plans, but not for finding new love. As online dating has grown, Inbaal says itaposs best to steer clear of first dates when Mercury is in retrograde. She said: “You should probably avoid meeting new people as much as possible during this time. Mercury is the planet of communication and it affects the way we talk. “When Mercury is in retrograde we might say something but mean something  and end up insulting the person we were trying to compliment. “Mercury also affects social media, emails and everything to do with communication. We could send a message and end up sending a nude to our mum instead of the person we’re trying to reach, or we could end up forgetting to press send on an important message. “With online dating, you have to be careful, because one  move and you could get blocked and you’ll never see them again.” Mercury is currently in retrograde and will be until  February - so those looking for love should beware. Inbaal continued: “The stars intel, they do not compel, which means you use what you like within astrology to help you along, but you don’t take onboard any of the worrying predictions and agonise over them. “If a prediction doesn’t sound like something in your favour, leave it at the door. That extends to my work with manesting, you just need to focus solely on the positives, and you will have a wonderful year.”Inbaal’s top five days to find love: · nd March – New Moon in Pisces· st April – New Moon in Aries · th April – New Moon in Taurus · th May – New Moon in Gemini · th June – New Moon in CancerTop times to avoid dating· th Jan–rd Feb· th May–rd June· th September–nd October· After th DecemberInbaal has teamed up with dating app, Safer Date, to explore the most romantic days of the Gregorian calendar Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveSpiritual Le\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

And now. after two years they have recruited over  participants from  sites across the UK.Prior to the launch of MND-SMART, only three of the sites had run clinical trials in MND in the last decade.MND-SMART is designed to test more than one drug at the same time and be adaptive so that researchers can mody their approach according to emerging results. The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.Christopher Johnson, Head of Education and Training, Cycling Scotland said: “We welcome the updates to the Highway Code as one of many actions needed to prevent people being seriously injured and killed on our roads in Scotland..remove“The new hierarchy of road users underpins the changes - those who can cause the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the risk to others: people driving will be responsible for ensuring people cycling, walking and wheeling are safe, while people cycling will be responsible for looking out for those walking and wheeling.“Many of the changes to the Highway Code are not new but are clarying or explaining existing rules. We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"peeblesshire-man-pays-tribute-borders-college-education","story":"A BORDERS man now living in America says his education helped kickstart a career that has seen him travel the globe.Craig Ferguson, who grew up in Walkerburn, resides in Houston, Texas with his we and two sons.The -year-old engineer’s career has also seen him call the Netherlands and Australia home, but he says he still misses the Borders.“I have been fortunate enough to travel the world and have worked in some interesting places but I miss the Scottish Borders,” said Craig.“I attended Walkerburn Primary School in , where I became friends with recent Borders College Honorary Fellow Ross Dickinson and we remain good friends to this day.“I developed a passion for the Borders landscape as a youngster and loved exploring the rolling hills.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"last-chance-subscribe-free-thirty-days","story":"The East Lothian Courier team want to bring you consistent exclusive coverage of our one-of-a-kind area.  In order to continuously deliver that, we need your support.

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

Rural communities seethe with as much intrigue as city offices and staff-rooms, and landscape is as menacing as cityscape.This inconvenient truism is brought home to Hinchclfe’s unnamed narrator when she is “hurtling together in silence between the confines of the dykes” with the bus driver on her way home from the local town to the cottage she has rented on the Hare House estate in Dumfries and Galloway. The bus hits a hare on the road, mashing its hindquarters but failing to kill it. Too urban and prissy to put the animal out of its misery, our narrator watches it “take too long to die”. As the moribund hare eyeballs her back, the “peaceful months of dreamless nights and busy days” that she has hitherto enjoyed in her cottage evaporate, just as her youth had done in London.Also watching her is Janet, who lives in the next-door cottage. A study in be-anoraked Scottish dourness, with the obligatory impenetrable accent, Janet manages to be malicious even when offering helpful lts into town. But is the older woman a witch, somehow in league with the live hares in the landscape and the stuffed ones in glass cases at Hare House, as Cass, the disturbed flibbertigibbet daughter of the house, maintains, or is she just a joyless busybody Either way, it becomes clear that the dying hare on the road is a metaphor both for what is to come and what has been. Did our narrator control its fate, or was it controlling hers  This question of who’s the victim and who’s the perpetrator pertains to the two intertwined mysteries – one in the past and one in the present – that lie at heart of Hinchclfe’s dark and absorbing second novel.As we learn that our nameless narrator has fled London and her previous job at a private girls’ school in mysterious circumstances, we begin to wonder what made her sixth-form class of fresh, young girls fall down “like petals from a rose”. Who was the victim of this mass fainting  The seasoned teacher grown bitter as love turned sour, or the smirking teenage girl with a “high, light silver” laugh Cass has mockery in her armour too, and the present begins to mirror the past. “She was, after all, no more than a silly girl, and I was done with teenage girls,” the ex-teacher, who is now secretly churning out essays for coin, opines, after being dragged past a magic pool to the family graveyard by the too-chummy girl. But when Cass’s brother asks our narrator to tutor his sister through her Highers, she agrees.Consciously or otherwise, the flame-haired beauty, who has all the loveliness that our narrator believes she has lost, sees through the older woman. “People are always drawn to Maggie’s Pool,” she jokes – or does she  “Especially those with a dark past and a history to hide.” When the ex-teacher loses her rag with the fragile girl over a prank with the stuffed hares in the hallway, we begin seriously to question her reliability as a narrator.“Too late, I recalled myself,” she tells the increasingly sceptical reader. “A reaction, of course, was what she wanted, what they always wanted.”A compelling chiller redolent of Zoë Heller’s Notes on a Scandal, Hare House treads the treacherous line between the real and the supernatural with dexterity. It is also a beautul,sinister, evocation of the Dumfries and Galloway landscape, which is the only hero in a cast of self-absorbed manipulators and, as the author notes in her acknowledgements, deserves to be better known."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-glasgow-keep-buchanan-galleries-invest-sauchiehall-street-wasteland","story":"However, it seems Susan Aitken believes the Buchanan Galleries has to go and our city streets could be “endlessly adaptable” .

Beautul on a nice day, but occasionally savage when the wind, scudding cloud and rain came in. On the latter days, there was satisfaction in using the skills acquired over the years to maintain a vital leline service.Removing all air traffic personnel from these airfields wouldn’t make them unsafe, but it would certainly make them less safe. In this day and age, that isn’t a direction we should be heading in, and I congratulate the union Prospect for its campaign to prevent it, and HIAL for having the courage and sense to mody their plans.Dough Maughan, Dunblane.A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTHWHEN I was in General Practice, a GP was a mix of clinician and social worker. It wasn’t satisfactory for doctors, but patients seemed content.A district nurse and health visitor attached to the practice was a huge improvement. They liked having the immediate support of a doctor and we benefited from their care of our patients and their reports at regular meetings. A nurse-run “Well Man\" clinic brought in patients who had not seen a doctor for many years and uncovered many problems, from hypertension to alcoholism, at an early and treatable stage.Now many practices employ part-time doctors. “I never see the same doctor twice” is the complaint I hear from patients. I started as a part-timer and found not being able to follow up the same patient totally unsatisfactory for me too. Telephone diagnoses with or without photos must be equally unsatisfactory in many cases. Getting it right first time matters.To satisfy patients’ needs, General Practice changed from a doctor with few treatments and little help to the specialised unit it is now. However, Covid’s lockdown has spawned an epidemic of mental problems, especially in the young. Some require medication. Many require what I would call community support.I remember a teenager with severe anorexia. She was continually in and out of psychiatric wards. Her single mother was distraught. However, her grandmother visited the girl in hospital, sat by her side and said how very sorry she was to see her like this because she and her husband had planned the trip of a letime to Australia and had been relying on their granddaughter to accompany them. The girl gained weight and was out of hospital in three weeks. They went to Australia when she came back the girl went straight to university, where she found supportive friends and work she enjoyed. Granny cured her, not me, not the psychiatrists.Is it time to discuss dferent ways of offering psychological care  Should we demand for our patients that psychiatrists set up and oversee groups who get together to work and talk and support each other  I have seen these used with benefit for early dementia where woodwork, knitting and crochet and chat reactivated failing brains. For depressed teenagers it could be extended to joining community choirs, walking groups, work in food banks, meals on wheels, anything that engenders self-worth. A cure without mind-bending medication is worth trying.Elizabeth Scott, Edinburgh.ISLANDS DESERVE TO BE SUBSIDISEDI NOTE an interesting article by Alan Simpson where he suggests that bridges rather than ferries should be employed to allow access to and from the Scottish islands .I would contend that bridges are simply not an option to the Western Isles, Shetland or Orkneywhere around  per cent of Scottish islanders permanently live. Think Boris Bridge to Northern Ireland that is the distance we are talking about. We are also not talking about connecting Denmark to Sweden and the traffic volumes that generates.Of the remainder, Bute, Raasay, Kerrera and Lismore might be feasible. Mull is already on the agenda.Scotland’s islands are amongst our greatest landscape and cultural assets and given their produce such as oil, renewables and whisky, they are also huge economic assets. They deserve taxpayer subsidy.More smaller ferries with more frequent sailings have been requested by a number of island groups let’s provide them.Willie Towers, Alford.A STORM IN A TEACUPHOLY mackerel, the ba’s on the slate, my gas at a peep, and my conversation up the creek without a paddle, on taking Fridays “Issue of the Day” on board .Hand on heart, I have aired some of those cited in recent weeks, and in the last dew days alone, “pearls before swine” on ceding access to a good friend on my way to “seeing a man about a dog”, aka “signing the visitors’ book”.Too long in the tooth, what to do Sweet Fanny Adams, I guess.R Russell Smith, Largs.CODE REDREGARDLESS of recent amendments to the Highway Code, all experienced car drivers will continue to observe the old unwritten rule about cyclists.

This might explain the nation’s new love affair with farming, evidenced by Amazon Prime’s Clarkson’s Farm – a hugely entertaining and informative expose of Jeremy Clarkson’s bumbling antics with sheep, among many other things – which turned out to be an unprecedented hit.A steady stream of celebrities are following in his muddy footsteps, including Kate Humble and Strictly’s Kelvin Fletcher. Meanwhile, farming programmes such as Countryfile and This Farming Le are attracting viewing figures not seen since the days of All Creatures Great and Small.For Emma Gray, however, farming is in the blood. Now living and farming with her husband Ewan and two-year-old son Len on the Isle of Bute, Scots-born Emma first came under the media spotlight back in  as a -year-old shepherdess living and working solo at Fallowlees, a remote National Trust hill farm in rural Northumberland.Staying in a relic of the past that had no mains electricity, gas, water, or telephone line, she looked after  sheep, often supplementing her income shepherding for other farms, which at one point saw her caring for  sheep.Emma’s years in Northumberland are vividly brought to le in her two books: One Girl And Her Dogs: Le, Love and Lambing in the Middle of Nowhereand more recent My Farming Le .The eldest of three girls born and brought up on the family’s farm in Hawick, Emma’s books are compulsive reading and reveal the physical and emotional highs and lows as well as providing frank and fascinating insight into farming le.Books led to television appearances, which included The Alan Titchmarsh Show – after which she was dubbed Britain’s loneliest shepherdess – and Robson Green’s Tales from Northumberland.The remote farm was also used as a location for the TV detective series Vera, which gave Emma unexpected funds, used to buy her first cows, four cross-bred heers and an abandoned horse, later joined by an abandoned goat she named Mr Tumnus after the faun in the Narnia books. Farming leaves scant time for a social le and, living in the middle of nowhere, Emma’s chances of finding a le partner were as remote as the farm.Tinder provided the solution, matching her with Galashiels firefighter Ewan Irvine, who admits he bought a copy of her book and fell in love with her before they even met. Possibly Tinder’s best match to date, Ewan split his time between shts and the farm in Northumberland.Emma, meanwhile, was training dogs, winning recognition and trophies as a capable dog handler and serious trialist – training and trialling sheepdogs being her number one passion since she was given her first dog, Bess, at the age of . In , she won the All-England Nursery Final with her dog, Jamie, and the following year was part of the winning England team at the World Sheepdog Trials in Holland.Then she hit the jackpot, selling one of her dogs for , guineas only to go on and later smash her own record with another dog she had bred and trained for a world record sum of , guineas – which she was chuffed to see merited a mention on Have I Got News For You.Marriage in  followed by the birth of baby Len the following year, made le on the farm in Northumberland untenable. “We had to drive four miles down a very rough forestry track to even reach a road,” says Emma.“Through friends, we heard about a farm tenancy on the Isle of Bute and applied – a rigorous process involving business plans, spreadsheets, gross margins and more, but were unsuccessful.“However, shortly after, Mount Stuart Estate offered us a -year tenancy to Ardros Farm, which covers  acres on the west side of the island. We couldn’t believe our luck,” she says. “Fortunately, Mount Stuart Estate is very forward-thinking and recognises the importance of giving young people opportunities. Having been so remote, we are now only a short drive into Rothesay, which is perfect for Len when it comes to nursery and school.”Another plus, having survived a steep learning curve living with Emma in Northumberland, the move to Bute was the catalyst for Ewan to swap the fire service for full-time farming.Born in Glasgow and raised in the south of Edinburgh, Ewan grew up with collies and had lived on a small holding for a while, so knew a little about keeping sheep and cows.“Our goal had been to find a farm that was big enough for both of us to work, and Ardros made it possible,” he says.Currently, they have  dogs,  sheep, and around  cows, the latter a mix of Aberdeen Angus and Bluegray, with a few English Longhorns.“Our claim to fame is one of our sheep is the brother of one of Jeremy Clarkson’s flock,” reveals Emma. Having recently been accepted into the organic scheme, the couple plan to breed and sell fully traceable organic beef and salt marsh lamb locally, making Ardros the first organic farm on the island.“We’ve never used pesticides or fertilisers, we just didn’t have the certication before,” says Emma.“If we are going to eat meat let’s eat good meat, and know it has been ethically reared, grass-fed, lived a good le and died on the island. Our farm is carbon neutral and therefore also better for the environment.”And so to dogs, of which there are many, including Purdy, a cute and highly affectionate toy poodle, which Emma reveals was a present to herself nearly  years ago.“I love all my dogs, but collies are working dogs, whereas Purdy is a pet. Most of my dogs have been Border Collies, the Ferrari of the dog world. To own a sheepdog is to know unbounded loyalty, plus sheep get used to the dog.“Our sheep are good, so we are able to breed and train dogs – and as many farmers don’t have the time to do it themselves, it’s a niche market.“We give them a carefree puppyhood and start training around eight or nine months, and when they reach the age of two, we have to decide whether to compete or work with a dog, or sell it, which can be hard, but then I know I’m helping dogs achieve what they have been bred to do,” explains Emma.The idea for a Sheepdog Schoolcame as a result of having a good internet connection for the first time. However, as being on an island makes it more dficult to provide tuition in person, Emma and Ewan have set up an online video subscription service, which currently has  subscribers.“Increasingly, we are finding people start off with the dog, then the sheep, then the farm … so our dogs are helping draw in a new sector.” Also new for , Emma and Ewan have collaborated with four other young farming couples on the island to form Trials of Bute , a two-day event planned for July - that will include four sheepdog trials and culminate in a championship with a prize pot of £. “Sheepdog trials are such popular spectator events our aim is to make this an annual event, free of charge and easily accessible, so people can come to the island and be inspired, which is how I started,” says Emma.Le has come full circle for this plucky couple.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I want to say to the people of this country, I know what the issue is” – Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“You” – Labours MPs in response. vw,vw,px, px\"SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford responds to a statement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to MPs in the House of Commons on the Sue Gray report “The Prime Minister has told the House that all guidance was completely followed, there was no party, Covid rules were followed and that ‘I believed it was a work event’.“Nobody, nobody believed it then. And nobody, nobody believes you now, Prime Minister. That is the crux – no s, no buts – he has wilfully misled Parliament.“It’s not my faultthe Prime Minister can’t be trusted to tell the truth” – Ian Blackford, SNP Westminster Leader“When hekindly invited me to see him  days ago, I told him that I thought he should think very carefully about what was now in the best interests of our country and of the Conservative Party, and I have to tell him he no longer enjoys my support” – Andrew Mitchell MP, former Conservative minister“Millions of people took seriously a communications campaign, apparently designed by behavioural psychologists to bully, to shame and to terry them into compliance with minute restrictions on their freedom.“What is my right honourable friend’s central message to those people who meticulously complied with all of the rules and suffered terribly for it, including, I might say, those people whose mental health will have suffered appallingly as a result of the messages his Government was sending out ” – Conservative MP Steve Baker vw,vw,px, px\"Lib Dem leader Ed Davey challenged the Prime Minister “Many had to bury their children alone, many couldn’t be there with them at the end. Meanwhile Number  partied.“Does the Prime Minister understand, does he care, about the enormous hurt his actions have caused to bereaved families across our country  Will he finally accept that the only decent thing that he can do now is to resign ” – Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats“Boris Johnson degrades our politics, he degrades his office, he tries to drag us all into the gutter” – Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivers a statement to MPs in the House of Commons “The report does absolutely nothing to substantiate the tissue of nonsense that hehas said. Absolute nonsense.“Instead this leader of the opposition, a former director of public prosecution – who used his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile, as far as I can see – he chose to use this moment to continually pre-judge a police inquiry” – Boris Johnson“What the Gray report does show is that Number  Downing Street was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public, so either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didn’t understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn’t think the rules applied to Number . Which was it ” – Theresa May, former prime minister vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer “He gleefully treats what should be a mark of shame as a welcome shield. But Prime Minister, the British public aren’t fools, they never believed a word of it, they think the Prime Minister should do the decent thing and resign.“Of course he won’t because he is a man without shame and just as he has done throughout his le, he’s damaged everyone and everything around him along the way” – Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Opposition“It seems a lot of people attended events in May  – the one I recall attending was my grandmother’s funeral. She was a wonderful woman… I drove for three hours from Staffordshire to Kent, there were only  at the funeral, many people who loved her had to watch online.“I didn’t hug my siblings, I didn’t hug my parents, I gave the eulogy and then afterwards I didn’t even go to her house for a cup of tea. I drove back three hours from Kent to Staffordshire.

Adrian Dennis PAThe company’s managing director John Auburn stressed his fledgling industry needed an adequate policy framework from governments.He said: “There’s a commercial market and government market but to open the market we need the right policy so that industry takes it seriously.“It’s a sort of chicken and egg, sowe can open the market we can create a whole new environment that’s safe… so we go from a throwaway culture – launch and forget – to actually bringing down failed spacecraft.”Later Charles toured the UK Atomic Energy Authority’sworld-leading fusion experiment near Oxford, which is working towards sustainable, low-carbon energy production at a time when gas prices have been soaring.The prince told Professor Ian Chapman, chief executive officer of the UKAEA, “we’ve got to do this” during his visit to learn more about nuclear fusion – the power source of the Sun.When nuclei are fused together, a large amount of energy is released which a commercial power station could use to generate electricity – but there are huge scientic and engineering challenges to overcome.After hosting Charles’ visit, Prof Chapman said: “We agreed signicant changes are needed to decarbonise the energy supply, and how fusion energy has huge potential to address that challenge.“The Prince of Wales was very keen to understand more about how fusion can be a critical piece of the future global energy puzzle and Britain’s leadership position in overcoming the great scientic and engineering challenges set before us.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did,” she added.Ms Gray, who was for a time a pub landlady, called for a robust policy to cover drinking in Government, saying that the “excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate”.– Pity for the ‘fall guy’One staff member believed to have been lined up for the chop to appease public anger is Martin Reynolds, the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary sent the email inviting staff to the “bring your own booze” event in the first lockdown.But Ms Gray has made that sacking a little bit harder by noting that with swelling staff size in No  the leadership structures “fragmented and complicated and this has sometimes led to the blurring of lines of accountability”.“Too much responsibility and expectation is placed on the senior official whose principalis the direct support of the Prime Minister. This should be addressed as a matter of priority,” Ms Gray wrote.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of . A documentary on the band is also due to be aired on BBC Alba soon."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4404766.jpg--.jpg?1643191025000\n","title":"history made at kells connor wi","story":" Kells  Connor WI made history in  when their AGM was held in a cattle shed , courtesy of the McAllister family.New President, Rosemary McAllister and her Committee members were elected including Anna Murphy , Eleanor Worthington , Helen Mitchell , Jill Crockard , Wilma Buick , Mary Crothers  Gwen Henson , Olga O’Neill  Iris Manson , Angela Currieand Sharon Graham The competition winners for the Bell Challenge Cup were: st – Maura Ellis, nd – Angela Currie and joint rd Sally Harper  Rosemary Farquhar.Maura Ellis spoke about her avid crafting interests and showed some of the wonderful exhibits made the talented Kells  Connor WI craftswomen.The ladies subsequently attended their annual Christmas dinner in the more luxurious surroundings of the Rosspark Hotel, where they enjoyed a delicious meal and held a quiz afterwards.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFollowing last Friday nights shock news that Edwin Poots failed in his bid to become the DUPs South Down candidate for Mays Assembly election, there has been many questions as to how the party’s selection process actually works.Sitting South Down MLA Jim Wells was not selected by the party, and the choice was between former DUP leader Edwin Poots and Diane Forsythe, who went before party officers last Friday. Ms Forsythe came out on top and the decision will now have to be ratied by the DUP#s central executive committee, which is made up of five representatives from each constituency, as well as MLAs and MPs.Read MoreEdwin Poots fails in attempt to get DUP’s nomination for the South Down constituencyMark Bain:OpinionTectonic plates have shted and left Poots thinking he should have been careful what he wished forMr Wells has said Mr Poots will challenge the selection decision, however it is unclearthis is likely to succeed.Here#s a quick guide to how the selection process works. How potential election candidates are chosenIn the run-up to an election, party officers -  senior members - determine how many candidates are to be selected to run for the party in each constituency. If it is decided that only one candidate will run in a constituency, then they are chosen by the constituency association.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Constituency associations are made up of certain party members and representatives in that area. If the constituency association has less than  members, however, then the candidate is chosen centrally by party officers. This is what happened last Friday, when party officers deselected Jim Wells - who would normally have been automatically nominated to run as he is the party#s sitting MLA - and Edwin Poots and Diane Forsythe put their names forward. Each were then interviewed by party officers, who in this case chose Ms Forsythe.If more than one candidate is to run in a constituency, one is selected by the constituency association and the other is selected by the party centrally via party officers. What happens once candidates are selected Once candidates are selected for each constituency, then the entire ticket has to be ratied by the party#s central executive committee, which numbers around  people. As mentioned previously, this is made up of five party representatives from each constituency and all the party#s MPs and MLAs.As one party source put it, when the slate of candidates is put to the central executive committee, it is all duck or no dinner, meaning the entire roster must be approved, or none of it.You either select everybody or no one, in which case it would be sent back to party officers, the source said. Can a representative who has not been selected by party officers still try and run in that constituency Jim Wells has said Mr Poots will continue to fight to be selected, and he could plead his case before the party executive, but this would mean the entire roster going back to party officers and ing to executive at a later date for ratication,he is successful.For instance, while it has to be all duck and no dinner, in theory the DUP executive could voice their approval for all the candidates bar South Down , in which case the South Down selection process would be repeated and the refreshed slate of candidates would go before the executive committee once again to be ratied at a later date. What happens now The DUP#s central executive committee is to meet next Friday, where the party’s entire Assembly election ticket will either be ratied, or not. If not, then the selection processes are repeated, where necessary, and the slate of candidates goes for ratication once again, until the slate is approved.Related topicsEdwin PootsJim WellsNorthern Ireland AssemblyMost ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayJohn Travolta makes horric attempt at Irish accent as he lands in ShannonPlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: Boris Johnson must resign over ‘clear wrongdoing and failure of leadership’, says SDLP’s Eastwood‘Any threat to collapse Stormont must be removed’ – Conor MurphyWells speaks of ‘deep hurt’ at how his political career endedKieran McGeeney pleased Armagh could hit back at people ‘having a pop’ at defence in win over DublinLatestEverton owner issues rallying call and urges fans to get behind Frank LampardLondon markets end aimless trading day as European rivals riseBodies removed from fire-ravaged block of flats after complex recovery processSacricing Ukraine would be ‘disastrous’ for the West, MPs toldSue Gray report: Man handed £, lockdown fine wants ‘apology and money back’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumViewpointOpinionCharities must look at sky-high salaries PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listMost ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayJohn Travolta makes horric attempt at Irish accent as he lands in ShannonPlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: Boris Johnson must resign over ‘clear wrongdoing and failure of leadership’, says SDLP’s Eastwood‘Any threat to collapse Stormont must be removed’ – Conor MurphyWells speaks of ‘deep hurt’ at how his political career endedKieran McGeeney pleased Armagh could hit back at people ‘having a pop’ at defence in win over DublinLatestGovernment should avoid NI rise during cost of living crisis, experts warnEnding mandate too little, too late, says care worker sacked for vaccine refusalTwo in, three out on busy deadline day for TottenhamWhat MPs said after release of Sue Gray reportRihanna debuts baby bump on stroll with boyfriend ASAP Rocky,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

EDAC had five runners who took part. Neil Curran had a decent run to lead his clubmates home in seventh place.With . as the total time run, he found it rather short and sweet, but challenging nonetheless due to the hilly route and the leg sapping mud.Mackenzie Murray really enjoyed his outing, coming th in ..His dad, Dee, was th in . and Adam Morgan paced it well to come th overall.Catherine OrsquoConnor was the only EDAC female but despite the back-up of a team, she went out hard and after a mid race tussle for the lead in the female category she settled into second place which she held until the line.Those who took part saw it as good practice for this weekend coming when the club will turn out in force for the NI and Ulster Masters and Intermediate Championships which take place at Queenrsquos Playing Fields in Belfast.When Ashling Murphy lost her le in tragic circumstances ,whilst out running mdash something that she loved and where she should not have been at risk mdash it struck a note with the running community both near and far.Runners were shocked that one of their own was so cruelly and tragically taken and in an attempt to find a positive in the depths of despair there have been some gatherings over the past week to allow them to express solidarity.One such event was organised by Ballygalget AC on Sunday and a large number gathered in the Exploris car park in Portaferry to run K together in her memory.Runners were invited to donate to Womenrsquos Aid instead of an event fee and as a result a signicant amount was raised for this worthy cause.Suzy Smith, accompanied by her brothers Donal and Patrick, made the trip and Mags Flynn also took part.RIP Aisling..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  January 22%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash An announcement is expected shortly that the multi-million pound ring-road for Downpatrick has been abandoned.The Government is believed to have given the thumbs down to the scheme, along with another to construct a link road between Church Street and Scotch Street.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady, yesterday labelled the decisions as a ldquototal indictment of Government planning, and he has asked for an urgent meeting with the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to seek a reconsideration.The ring road, which would join the Ballydugan Road and Belfast Road, has long been viewed as the keystone to the Downpatrick regeneration project which was launched by Mr Needham over  months ago.At that time he came out strongly in favour of the ring road but the massive cost of such a project is believed to have swayed the Government towards the abandonment decision.What has further angered Mr McGrady is that the ring road replaced the Church Street Scotch Street link for which money had been available last year.ldquoNow that money has gone presumably spent where, so that no funds are available this year or next, said Mr McGrady. ldquoAt the time, when it was alleged that new studies were required. I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February .

A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare.

It’s either continue to do nothing and run the assembly down until March, trusting Liz Truss, one of Johnson’s commandants, with the protocol, or collapse it now. The failure of the DUP to carry out their threats has left them in a very weak position. I would even question their support among grassroots unionist people who have seen their weakness.

It seems that the DUP position with grassroots unionism is weakening. They argue it was their opposition that has brought the foreign aggressors of the EU back to the table. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. Who are they trying to kid  Someone like Kate Hoey and other lay people, who are not elected politicians, have taken more action to oppose the iniquitous protocol. May is fast approaching and we will be waiting for the usual spiel such as vote for usyou oppose the protocol. It took some unionist politicians time to waken up to the rubbish being spun, like, Northern Ireland can have the best of both worlds. If we look at the DUP’s record of their opposition, it is derisory.Unionist parties need to make their position clear that a vote for them will mean all-out war against the protocol evenit means scrapping support for the Belfast Agreementand pulling down the Assembly. The powers that be must be made to sit up and realise that unionists have had enough of their country being made a bargaining tool.

You can’t leave him not running in the election, you can’t.”Mr Wells said he was quick to lend his support to Mr Poots in the South Down selection contest, saying: “When it became apparent to me that I was toast, I was gone, the obvious person I thought was a very suitable candidate was Edwin who has vast experience and could give South Down first-class representation. “That hasn’t, as yet, happened and I think that’s very regrettable. “We’re going to have to wake up on Monday morning and ask ‘how do we deal with this’.”The News Letter approached Mr Poots, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and Ms Forsythe for comment on the selection process yesterday.The party has remained tight-lipped following Friday’s selection process.A spokesman pointed the News Letter to a brief statement outlining its selection of Ms Forsythe.Jim WellsEdwin PootsJeffrey DonaldsonDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularJim Wells: I have to accept my DUP career has ended in humiliationJim Wells: There could be a twist in tale of DUP South Down nominationThe killing of two RUC officers in Londonderry was the backdrop to Bloody SundayBen Lowry: DUP seems to be staking out the centre of unionismU share acoustic rendition of Sunday Bloody Sunday on th anniversary of Bloody Sunday events in LondonderryMost PopularBest electric heaters UK : portable electric, ceramic, fan heaters from Dimplex, De’Longhi, SilentnightBest indoor rowing machines UK : at home rowers including the best-selling Concept  and Aldi’s budget optionSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home safe from a fire, and is a heat alarm worth it  best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person tents ideal for hikingBest air puriers : Do air puriers work  Can they remove viruses, and which are the best in the UK                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This motion was proposed by Green Party Councillor Simon Lee, and called upon NILGOSC to:“Outline their plans for esting from fossil fuels, including timelines, and request that they meet with Officers, Trade Unions and Elected Members to present these plans.”While stopping short of calling for immediate estment, the motion passed by Lisburn and Castlereagh City represents another step forward, and means that a majority of councils inNorthern Irelandnow wish NILGOSC to undertake actions to bring about estment. Motions calling for full and imminent estment have previously been passed by Newry Mourne and Down, Belfast City, Fermanagh and Omagh, and Derry City and Strabane. Councillors proposing such motions have been supported in their efforts by Fossil Free NI, a grassroots group which has been campaigning for estment since .Commenting on the passing of the motion at Mid Ulster Council, Councillor Dan Kerr said: “I am glad that the council unanimously supported the estment motion, and that we, alongwith many other local authorities both nationally and internationally, have added weight to this campaign. We hope that it can highlight the unethical nature of continued investment inthe fossil fuel industry, and also that with practical action we can strive for a better world for both present and future generations.”Dr Seamus Campbell of Fossil Free NI also expressed his delight at the passing of the motions, adding: “With COP highlighting the necessity of urgent climate action, it isimperative that our communities are not fuelling climate catastrophe.

Listening to Blink  ‘I Miss You’ and hearing the piano and we thought ‘wouldn’t it be great to have a song with piano like this ’“We’ve been able to do that, but still making it sound like our own sound. People who have heard it say it sounds like something from circa  and we’ve hit the nail on the head.“It was recorded at Halfbap Studios in Belfast with Graham Davidson as producer. We loved the work he did with us for our first single.”Detailing how the band now has a fourth member, Daniel added: “Jordan has been playing since   and we’ve known him for a good while. He adds another dimension to what we’re doing.“Chris will play the piano and lead guitar, while our drummer Thomas designed the artwork for the cover.

They spent a total of  days in the neo-natal ward at Antrim Area Hospital, where little Samantha fought hard to overcome a number of health issues, including a heart murmur, spinal issues and two blood transfusions.Sharon said: “We would be lost with TinyLe and Doreen. Doreen has been more than a neighbour - she is special. She looks after our son Jonathan who was also premature, born at  weeks. We got to know TinyLe after Jonathan was born and they have been a leline to us. We are really looking forward to taking Samantha to TinyGym next month in Antrim.”TinyGym is a specialist physiotherapy programme for premature babies delivered through TinyLe in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, led by a physiotherapist and specialist nurse practitioner with the support of TinyLe family support officers.TinyGym sessions are delivered in groups in local community venues in Antrim and Ballymena. TinyGym is specically for babies that are born at  weeks or sooner and of low birth weight, and referrals are made by the physiotherapist on the Neonatal Unit in Antrim.TinyGym is just one of the many services TinyLe offers to families who need their support in the darkest of times. Other key services include the breast pump loan serviceweekly Neo-natal Unit visits, : telephone support and signposting from TinyLe family support officers, TinyTime groups and baby massage .Vital support for NI familiesOver  babies are born too soon, too small or too sick in Northern Ireland each year.Some arrive as early as  weeks, weighing as little as lb  grams, the same weight as half a bag of sugar.Doreen’s donation will ensure TinyLe can continue to provide support services so vital for the six families in need every day in Northern Ireland.Community fundraiser Sarah Wilson said, “We are so very appreciative of Doreen’s efforts to support Samantha and TinyLe. It has been lovely getting to know Doreen and supporting heras she raised money for TinyLe so that we can continue to provide the emotional and practical support that families like Sharon and Tony deserve.
