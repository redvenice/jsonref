They are not directly linked to the Russian government and therefore they are plausibly deniable.\u0027Sources said the militia were briefed about Putin\u0027s plans against Ukraine back in December, long before the Russian army was told. Boris Johnson today urged NATO to act \u0027harder\u0027 against Russia to end the war \u0027faster\u0027 as he unveiled a wave of new sanctions - which include the Wagner Group.  The Wagner Group are among the targets in the latest set of measures, announced as the PM arrived in Brussels for talks with the military alliance.There are claims the notorious mercenaries have been tasked with assassinating Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians.The new sanctions cover iniduals including billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov, Herman Gref, and Polina Kovaleva, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u0027s alleged stepdaughter.Galina Danilchenko, installed by Russia as the \u0027mayor\u0027 of Melitopol has also become the first person sanctioned for \u0027collaboration with Russian forces\u0027 in Ukraine.Six more banks have also been sanctioned, according to the Foreign Office.As he arrived in Brussels, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We\u0027ve got to step up. We\u0027ve got to increase our support. \u0027We\u0027ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves, and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.\u0027We\u0027re moving, really, from a programme of supporting resistance to supporting the Ukrainian defence of their own country.\u0027Mr Johnson is calling on countries such as Germany and France to ramp up their response, warning that the military alliance must not be \u0027erted\u0027 by mounting nuclear threats from Moscow.He suggested that Russia should be prevented from using gold reserves to prop up its economy - and also dismissed a bid to host the 2028 Euro football tournament as \u0027beyond satire\u0027. Ahead of the NATO meeting - being attended by Joe Biden - the premier announced the UK is giving Ukraine 6,000 more missiles and £25million to support its desperate struggle against the Russian invasion. Reports have long claimed the force is Putin\u0027s personal assassination squad, but are far enough removed to afford the Russian president plausible deniability.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and the presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak have been listed as among other alleged assassination targets. Mercenaries were reportedly given a 24-person \u0027kill list\u0027 including the entire Ukrainian cabinet, mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both boxing champions who have become iconic figures on the front lines of the capital.  The attack was sabotaged after the plans reached the upper echelons of the Ukrainian government on March 5, prompting Kyiv to declare a 36-hour \u0027hard\u0027 curfew, ordering everyone indoors so that soldiers could sweep the streets for Russian saboteurs.More than a dozen attempts are said to have been made to kill Mr Zelensky since Russian troops launched a savage invasion of Ukraine on February 24.   Mr Johnson said this morning: \u0027Vladimir Putin is plainly determined to double down on his path of violence and aggression, absolutely brutal the way he\u0027s treating the Ukrainian people.\u0027We\u0027ve got to step up, we\u0027ve got to increase our support, we\u0027ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today as we are.\u0027Looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.\u0027Foreign Secretary Liz Truss - who is also attending the NATO summit - said in a statement: \u0027These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price. \u0027Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up\u0027.All those sanctioned will have UK assets frozen and be subject to travel bans.The Foreign Office said the total global asset value of the sanctioned banks to £500billion while oligarchs and family members hit are worth more than £150billion. "},{"url":null,"title":"Wales end Covid self isolation public mask wearing Monday","story":"Share this articleDr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, urged Britons to wear masks in enclosed spaces and socialise outdoors again – just weeks after the restrictions were downgraded from law.Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King’s College London, added: ‘We need to be telling people to self-isolate with cold-like symptoms and get a test if they can.’Government dashboard data shows another 98,204 Covid-positive tests were logged in the last 24 hours across the UK, up by 9.5 per cent in a week and more than a third higher than a fortnight ago.Cases have been trending upwards across the UK for nearly a month, with experts blaming the more transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.2, which is now dominant, and ditching Covid curbs. Meanwhile, 165 Britons died within 28 days of a positive test, climbing by a fifth in a the last seven days.And 1,979 infected people were admitted to hospitals across the UK on Sunday, the latest date figures are available for, 11 per cent higher than one week earlier.Separate data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today showed Covid cases jumped in all of England’s 149 local authorities in the week to March 20 for the third week in a row.The figures show the worst-hit areas are concentrated in the South West, with around 1.5 per cent of people testing positive in North Somerset, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and Torbay.Scotland is currently treating 2,322 Covid patients, the highest figure ever recorded in the country, breaching the peak of 1,571 during the Omicron wave and 2,053 during the 2020 winter peak. But its daily admissions appear to have peaked at 223 last week, in a promising sign the outbreak is slowing down.In England, there are now 13,602 patients with the disease in hospital, which is less than half of the peak in early 2021. But figures from NHS England show more than half are not primarily unwell with the virus, suggesting the rise is a reflection of higher infection rates in the community, rather than a surge in severe disease.On the back of data showing rising admissions and infections, Dr Hopkins said the figures are ‘a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over’.She added: ‘Hospital admissions and cases of Covid have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.‘Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses.‘Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of Covid.‘Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.’Her comments echoing pre-Freedom Day rhetoric come just one month exactly since restrictions were eased and public messaging on Covid was downgraded, with Brits encouraged to live with the virus and choose to follow protocols themselves where sensible."},{"url":null,"title":"North Korea releases pictures intercontinental missile launch","story":"Share this article   The US and South Korean militaries previously said the North was preparing for a full-range test of the Hwasong-17 after concluding two of the recent midrange launches included components of the new ICBM.Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-President Donald Trump. But negotiations derailed in 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of US-led sanctions against the North in exchange for a limited surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The ICBMs launched in three 2017 test flights demonstrated they could reach into the US mainland. The larger Hwasong-17 may be intended to be armed with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defenses.North Korea\u0027s government in January had issued a veiled threat to end Kim\u0027s moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility.South Korea\u0027s military has also detected signs that North Korea may be restoring some of the nuclear-testing tunnels it detonated just before Kim\u0027s first meeting with Trump in 2018.Some experts say the North may resume nuclear testing in coming months to claim it has acquired an ability to build nuclear warheads small enough to fit on some of its new delivery systems, including the hypersonic missile.North Korea has previously said nuclear weapons are the only thing saving the country from sharing Ukraine’s fate - the first sign that Pyongyang was nervous about Russia’s invasion.One high-ranking North Korean official said Ukraine would never have been attacked if it had kept its cache of Soviet nuclear weapons.While another said only nukes could prevent foreign invasions, and that the regime should prioritise national defence above seeking international aid.The startling admissions were revealed by Daily NK, a newspaper with sources inside the country, based in neighbouring South Korea.The example of Ukraine is not the only reason North Korea fears giving up its nukes.Pyongyang already viewed the denuclearisation of Libya in 2003 as a cautionary tale, noting how NATO later intervened there in 2011, leading to the death of its leader, Muammar Gaddafi. "},{"url":null,"title":"Zelensky scolds Europe late imposing sanctions Russia","story":"Share this article   The horror inflicted on civilians sheltering inside a Mariupol theatre that was bombed by Russian jets last week has been laid bare as the first footage from inside the destroyed building emerged today. Never-before-seen video shows injured civilians covered with dust filing out of the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre after it was near-totally destroyed in Russian bombs aimed at building on March 16 despite a large inscription saying \u0027children\u0027 being clearly visible on the pavement outside.It came as city councillors said accounts they had been given from survivors of the bombing suggested that at least 300 people had died in the attack. If confirmed, it would mark the single largest losses of innocent life during the month-long war to date.   \u0027From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,\u0027 Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.\u0027I do not want to believe in this horror. Until the last moment I want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say the opposite,\u0027 officials said.Petr Andryuschenko, advisor to deputy mayor of Mariupol, said in a separate interview with the BBC that 600 people had been sheltering in the theatre at the time it was struck and that the 300 who are now presumed dead were in a bomb shelter underneath it which got buried in the rubble.The exact death toll is still uncertain because rescuers have not yet been able to get into the shelter because Russia continues shelling the area. However, it is presumed that all those inside have now died. Mariupol city hall said Friday the theatre was destroyed in a \u0027cynical\u0027 attack and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.Zelensky says nearly 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power in the besieged city and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.The leader of Russia\u0027s southern republic of Chechnya said Thursday that forces from his region had taken control of Mariupol city hall and hoisted the Russian flag.   Mariupol has been the scene of some of the worst devastation of the war, which has seen Russia relentlessly besiege and pummel Ukraine\u0027s cities. The misery inside them is such that nearly anyone who can is trying to leave and those left behind face desperate food shortages in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.In the shelled city of Kharkiv, mostly elderly women came to collect food and other urgent supplies. In the capital of Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.For civilians unable to join the flood of refugees from Ukraine, the days of plenty in the country are becoming just a fading memory, as the war grinds into a second month.With Ukrainian soldiers battling Russia\u0027s invasion force to a near stalemate in many places and the president urging people to remain steadfast, the U.S. and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia: a new partnership to reduce Europe\u0027s reliance on Russian energy and slowly squeeze off the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from sales of fossil fuels."},{"url":null,"title":"Biden EU announce new deal natural gas Europe","story":"Share this article U.S. exporters have already shipped record volumes of LNG to Europe for three consecutive months, as prices have jumped to more than 10 times higher than a year ago.Getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"diplomat jim kelly a great family man and consummate professional","story":"President Michael D.

Higgins and the Taoiseach’s aide de camp Commandant Claire Mortimer attended the service at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Kimmage Manor on Friday morning. The chief mourners were Mr Kelly’s wife Anne, daughters Orla and Ciara, sister Bernie and brothers Michael, Peter and Stephen.Originally from Drimnagh in Dublin, Mr Kelly worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs for almost 30 years and spent the last decade in New York and Canada.Peter Kelly told the congregation that from a very early age his brother had shown an interest in politics and world affairs as well as a passion for sport.He said that after starting work in the department, Jim “quickly realised that he was in his lifetime career”.“His day at work was usually full of many of his favourite interests, and he often recalled to Anne that perhaps the only job he might enjoy slightly as much would be as a sports journalist,” he said.“He was fortunate to work at a variety of positions in the department, both at home in Dublin and abroad in Copenhagen, Brussels, New York and Canada.”‘Great pride’Peter Kelly said his brother’s role in condemning the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine was “something for which he had great pride”. While Jim was a “consummate professional” and a “leading diplomat”, nothing was more important to him than his family, he added.“He did everything possible to provide his daughter’s a very supportive and loving environment, which was also full of fun and adventures.”Jim enjoyed “a very happy life” with Anne, who he had known for more than 30 years, and they shared their enjoyment of “simple pleasures and their love of travelling,” Peter added.He said the family had received many “kind-hearted and thoughtful comments” from his brother’s friends and colleagues all over the globe.“Jim, we all love you and words cannot begin to convey how much we will all miss you,” he added. “While you have left a wonderful legacy and a big hole in many lives, you will never be forgotten.‘Eternally grateful’“We ask that you give your loved ones who are hurting, a sign that you are there with them still. We shall always treasure the time that we have spent with you and we are eternally grateful for having you in our lives.”Fr Roddy Curran, who led the service, said Jim Kelly was “a great family man, good husband and a true and genuine civil servant”.“He was faithful and dutiful, giving us good example of the life of a true servant,” he said.Fr Curran said Jim Kelly had many friends and “radiated his goodness and kindness to others”.Offertory gifts included the Dublin GAA jersey Mr Kelly had worn when he watched the county’s senior football team win their fifth consecutive All-Ireland final at Croke Park in 2019, a Manchester United jersey, a New York city marathon headband, a New York Yankees baseball cap and books, including one on the 50th anniversary on Ireland’s membership of the United Nations.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"holohan to step down to take position at trinity college","story":"Micheál Martin said Dr Holohan had ‘undoubtedly helped save lives, and kept Ireland safe during an exceptionally challenging two years’.Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan is to step down from his position this summer to take up the role of Professor of Public Health Strategy and Leadership at Trinity College Dublin. Dr Holohan, who has been in the position for almost 15 years, became a national figure during the Covid crisis, when he led the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).He will remain in his current role until July. In a statement on Friday afternoon, Dr Holohan said it had been a “great privilege for me to serve as Chief Medical Officer and to have had an opportunity to be directly involved in issues of great importance and relevance to the health of the people of Ireland.”However, he has not appeared in the media or been active on social media for several weeks, since he recommended at the end of February that the Nphet be stood down in favour of a new structure to advise Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. His office continues to work on the Covid pandemic, advising Mr Donnelly on policy. Dr Holohan has been in the position of CMO since late 2008, and worked as Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the Department since 2001.During his time in the role, he dealt with the Swine Flu pandemic and also controversy following the emergence of the CervicalCheck scandal.‘Significant and lasting impact’As news of his move was confirmed, Mr Donnelly said that : “Since his appointment as Chief Medical Officer in December 2008, Dr Holohan has made a significant and lasting impact on health in Ireland. Throughout his time as CMO, Tony has used his public health leadership ability, alongside his many other skills and insights, to inform and influence decisions at the highest level in order to protect public health. “Throughout the pandemic his invaluable advice to me, and to the Government has shaped our response to Covid-19, and I witnessed first-hand his unwavering dedication to protecting the health of the people of Ireland. He will play a critical role in applying his knowledge and skills to the development of the next generation of thinking and practice in public health, and I wish Tony all the best in this new and exciting chapter in his career.”The Taoiseach also expressed gratitude for Dr Holohan’s efforts over the during of his time in the CMO role and, in particular, through the pandemic.“His steadfast assured advice, and willingness to communicate over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly helped save lives, and kept Ireland safe during an exceptionally challenging two years.“I have known Tony, and had the privilege to work with him, since he was appointed Deputy Chief Medical Officer in 2001, and then during his 14 years as the Chief Medical Officer,” said Micheál Martin.“His work chairing the Nphet, his professionalism, and calm and personable nature gave us all the assurance we needed during the pandemic. I wish him and his family the very best of luck for the future,” he said. Meanwhile, the Provost of Trinity, Professor Linda Doyle, said she and her colleagues at the university are excited Dr Holohan will be working with others at the college “to learn the lessons of Covid and prepare for these future challenges”.“Dr Holohan will not be attached to a single School or Discipline within Trinity. Instead, his role will traverse the Faculties of Arts Humanities and Social Sciences and Health Sciences, recognising the complexity and scope of population health challenges in the modern era.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Video: ReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had been delivering a speech on ‘building common ground’ at an event organised by the John and Pat Hume Foundation in Belfast when the security alert happened.A Belfast speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was interrupted on Friday morning after a “suspect device” was found in the car park of the venue. A van had been hijacked and a canister or device put in the back. The driver was ordered to drive it to the Houben Centre on the Crumlin Road in north Belfast, where the event was taking place. Fr Gary Donegan of Holy Cross church – which is beside the Houben Centre – said the driver had been hijacked “at gunpoint” and was “very shocked”. Mr Coveney later said in a tweet: “Saddened and frustrated that someone has been attacked and victimised in this way and my thoughts are with him and his family.” A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said: “The Minister and team are safe, have been taken to a secure location and the PSNI are in control of the situation.” Sarah McKinley of DowntownCool FM radio, who was among those evacuated from the venue, told The  she had seen the victim of the hijacking who was a “workman, clutching a toolbag standing outside, he was completely shellshocked”. “He said he had been hijacked and told to drive to the centre.” Fr Donegan, who introduced Mr Coveney at the event on Friday morning, said the Minister had been speaking for about five minutes when “the close protection people started beckoning towards me … he said, ‘Father, a man’s been hijacked at gunpoint and there’s a van in the grounds with a possible device in it’. “Immediately we had to go to the minister and he was in the middle of it, it was reminiscent of George Bush, 911 type of thing, told you need to get out of here. “The close protection people got him away and then we evacuated the Houben Centre – ironically, a peace hub that straddles both sides of the community,” he said. A funeral which had been due to take place at Holy Cross church was disrupted. Fr Donegal said the parish priest, Fr John Craven, had “adapted brilliantly and did some kind of service in the lower car park”. “You think of the disruption that’s taking place, and the fact that a funeral, and you think of a family grieving, you just think of the mindlessness of people who on a day that we were remembering people who brought us in a great part to where we are today … we’re here since 1869 and even in the worst of the Troubles no funeral was ever stopped.” Sources at the scene said it was believed the van had been hijacked on the Shankill Road, a loyalist area. This has not been confirmed by police. Some loyalists have been critical of Irish ministers, including Mr Coveney and the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, over what they claim has been their role in the Northern Ireland protocol, and there are posters criticising them in some loyalist parts of Belfast. Mr Coveney had been delivering a speech on the theme “building common ground” at an event organised by the John and Pat Hume Foundation. ‘Twisted and deranged’The SDLP MP Claire Hanna, who was also at the event and was among those evacuated, said the ethos of the event had been about reconciliation and the audience was “to a man and a woman, people of good faith who have engaged in reconciliation from all political backgrounds … talking about how we can move forward together. “To attack that just shows how twisted and deranged an ideology this is, and the message is these same people who were in that room stood against that for many years and will continue to do so. People who attempt to intimidate and ide will not succeed,” she said. The event organiser, Tim Attwood, said the Foundation was “more committed than ever to ensure that those who think they can achieve their goals through violent means, they are history. “The only way, as John Hume said, is through peace, non violence, dialogue and partnership. “We’re upset that the community in Ardoyne and Twaddell has been put under security risk and we apologise for that, but it doesn’t deter the work of the Foundation,” he said. A 400-metre cordon remained in place on Friday lunchtime around the scene of the alert, and there is significant disruption to traffic. Mr Coveney had to leave the stage at the Houben Centre in north Belfast after a message was relayed to him while speaking. The Minister interrupted his speech saying, “I’m afraid I have to leave, I hope I’ll be back in a few minutes, you’ll just have to understand that.” The building was then evacuated. He had told the event: “The patient work of reconciliation and deepening of relationships does need to continue on our own island.” Mr Attwood told the PA news agency that the security alert is a reminder “to everyone that there is no role in our society for violence”. He added: “A suspect device will not stop the work of the John and Pat Hume Foundation.” In a statement, the PSNI said: “Police are currently in attendance of a security alert at the Crumlin Road area of north Belfast. Motorists are advised to avoid the area and seek alternative main routes for their journey. There are no further details at this stage.” – Additional reporting ReutersPA"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"after six long toxic years a civilised debate about eu and brexit","story":"Former French president Francois Mitterrand and former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: Ken Clarke suggested one reason Helmut Kohl and Mitterrand patronised Thatcher and failed to take her seriously was because she was a woman.

Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin to focus on \u0026#39complete liberation\u0026#39 of Donbas regionCochrane’s Scotland: The SNP must stop blaming Boris and start putting policy over presentation Le Pen gains on Macron as French presidential race tightens in final stagesThe public is turning on the shambolic ToriesRussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastLiz Truss ‘urging’ Rishi Sunak to pour millions into new ‘Ukraine Marshall Plan’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"le pen gains macron french presidential race tightens final","story":"Emmanuel Macron’s lead has slipped two weeks before the French presidential election, with far-Right leader Marine Le Pen and Left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon both making gains in the race for a place in the run-off.Mr Macron still has a comfortable lead ahead of the two-round vote on April 10 and April 24, and is on track to become the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac.The latest IFOP daily poll places Mr Macron on 28.5 per cent of voter intentions for the first round, ahead of Ms Le Pen on 20 per cent and Mr Mélenchon on 14 per cent.Support for Valérie Pécresse, the hope of the mainstream Right, has meanwhile slipped to 11.5 per cent, neck-and-neck with extreme-Right polemicist Éric Zemmour.Mr Macron has benefited from a sizeable bump in his ratings since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with voters largely backing his efforts to find a way out of the conflict.But the “rally round the flag” effect has started to wear off. The president has dropped down 1.5 points over the past week, according to IFOP, although he remains four points up from his position before the start of the war.“Macron is complacent,” charged Philippe Marlière, Professor of French and European politics at University College London.“He hasn’t been seen much on the campaign trail. There are reasons for that – he’s the incumbent president, he’s very busy, notably with the war in Ukraine. However, the nearer we get to election day, I think that may be a problem.”Mr Marlière predicted that the president’s share of the vote could ultimately come in well below the current 28-30 per cent predicted by pollsters as voters flock to candidates who have gone to more effort to explain their policy platforms.Meanwhile, the wind is back in the sails of Ms Le Pen, who is up 2.5 points in the IFOP poll compared to a week earlier.The leader of the Rassemblement National has clawed back some of the support she had lost to Mr Zemmour, scooping up votes from those unhappy with his previous outspoken support for Vladimir Putin.Ms Le Pen has also spent months campaigning on cost of living measures, which has resonated with voters as the Ukrainian conflict drives fuel and food prices ever higher.A repeat of the 2017 election, pitting Mr Macron against Ms Le Pen in the run-off, remains the most likely scenario. But Mr Mélenchon, a veteran Left winger, is hoping to trigger an upset.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin to focus on \u0026#39complete liberation\u0026#39 of Donbas regionCochrane’s Scotland: The SNP must stop blaming Boris and start putting policy over presentation The public is turning on the shambolic ToriesRussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastLiz Truss ‘urging’ Rishi Sunak to pour millions into new ‘Ukraine Marshall Plan’Russian general who said Ukraine invasion would be over in hours is reported killedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10 mini budget graphs expose","story":" mini-Budget graphs that expose just how horrying the cost of living crisis isChancellor Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement had the usual cycle of a glossy sheen giving way to disappointment.

But what sets this one apart is the sheer scale of the crisis hitting Brits. whose disposable incomes will see the sharpest fall since records began in . The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.  This Office for Budget Responsibility graph is an even starker way of portraying the same data. It shows disposable incomes only fell in real terms in nine years since the s - four of them since the Tories took power in . And the fall projected for - is by far the deepest, outstripping those in the s or the wake of the  financial crash. Wages are now £k lower than without the  crash  This shocking chart on wages from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the same problem in the starkest way yet. The experts warned wages are now £, lower than what they could have beenthe trend of - had continued. The financial crash of  still cases a long shadow over politics today. The national debt wasnapost cut by the Tories This chart from the Treasury explodes the myth that the Tories brought down ‘ Labour ’s debt’ from the financial crash with austerity.Net debt shot up due to the bank bailouts and other measures of , but has continued rising since and spiked again due to Covid. It is still predicted to be .% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And the cost of servicing that debt rockets as inflation rises. Since the last forecast, the cost of servicing the national debt has risen by more than £billion in - alone.  This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on. That falling of debt continued through the s and stayed low until the financial crash. It jumped, then climbed further under the Tories. Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in . The OBR found previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%.  This is a dferent way of looking at the same information on tax. In this chart, the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how ‘Illusionist’ Rishi Sunak is in fact raising taxes on Brits - not cutting them. A median earner on £, will be £ worse off in   than   - a £k earner will be nearly £ worse off. Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid. The OBR warns the tax burden overall will reach .% of GDP in - - the highest level since the late s. That’s up from % of GDP in -. It’s fuelled by rising National Insurance but also in frozen thresholds in income tax until .

The -year-old husband and father, a retired civil engineer, cast doubt over whether he would meet the PM, who he said did not even spare five minutes to call his family while he was jailed in Iran. Mr Ashoori was imprisoned for five years after he was arrested in Tehran while visiting his elderly mother in . He described his joy on touching down at Brize Norton on the same plane as charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. Appearing on Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews, Mr Ashoori voiced his anger over UK delays to paying its debt to Iran, and said his we Sherry Izadi did not get a response from Mr Johnson when she contacted him about her husband’s case. Mr Ashoori also told the broadcaster about a voice message he himself sent Mr Johnson, explaining: “That was during the time of the Covid that I was angry because at the same time I was blaming those who had captured us I was blaming the British government, why don’t you do anything about it ” He added: “I was really angry and that’s why I decided to send that voice message hoping that it would make a change.”  Asked about whether his we got a response, Mr Ashoori said: “No and it took Richard a hunger strike.” Richard Ratclfe, the husband of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, went on hunger strike twice during his we’s detention. Asked again whether his we had heard back from Mr Johnson, Mr Ashoori said: “No. Unfortunately. She made many attempts and all of them were unsuccessful.” Now Mr Johnson wants to meet them, according to Mr Ashoori. “Last night we received a letter, now he’s eager to see us. How would you interpret that ” he said on the programme. Asked how he feels about it, Mr Ashoori said: “I think that it’s a bit of opportunism involved in it at the same time as all of this has happened under his command. “So one could argue that it was the British government, the present British government, that succeeded in doing that which is correct, the same time you could say that why didn’t you contact us, my family and now you are eager to do that. “How would you expect us to absorb that  How would you expect us to think of you with this letter now  Why couldn’t this letter be sent five months ago, a year ago, two years ago  Why now ”  Askedhe will see Mr Johnson, he said: “I’m not sure.” Mr Ashoori said he “%” agreed with what Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe had said during a press conference about how she should have been released six years ago. Mr Ashoori said: “I agree with Nazanin %. She in fact put her finger on the right button by saying that. “She should have been here years agothat debt was paid. That wasn’t a ransom that was a debt that the British government owed. “It should have been paid andit was paid perhaps none of this would have happened. So yes, I feel a bit angry.” Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe said it had taken too long for the Government to pay a £ million debt to Iran, which helped secure her release. Speaking about his time in Evin Prison, Mr Ashoori said: “Literally that was the valley of hell. “Because in addition to your own suffering you see the suffering of all the people who are around you. “Each of them in their own dferent way.

The telegenic Chancellor was praised for the generosity of the furlough scheme and his slick performances at the Covid press conferences. Sunak is now discovering that popularity can be as superficial as the images on his Instagram account. His Spring Statement did not just land badly, it belly-flopped. There was nothing extra to help people with the cost of living, an additional .million people will be dragged into poverty and workers are going to be hit with higher taxes. Those who had shares in Sunak are now trying to offload them before then reach the status of a Russian rouble. The fall in Sunak’s stock seems to have happened overnight. But the Chancellor’s downfall has been in the making ever since he stepped into Number . He was presented by his slick PR machine as a slightly nerdy guy who wears a hoodie to work, has a nice haircut and wouldn’t offend your motheryou brought him round to dinner.  He was a safe pair of hands whose grasp of detail and measured manner offered a reassuring contrast to the bumbling, chaotic style of Boris Johnson. That’s what made him an appealing prospect for many voters - especially moderate conservatives - as a potential future leader. But beneath the soft-speaking and cosy leisurewear was a Thatcherite Tory, whose privileged upbringing, private education and vast family wealth has apparently left him struggling to understand the real world.For example, the Government was today forced to admit the Chancellor had borrowed a Kia Rio from a Sainsbury’s garage employee for a staged photo of him filling up with petrol with a broad grin. Downing Street said he paid for the petrol himself. In an interview yesterday morning, Mr Sunak said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all dferent breads in my house.” The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  And the same day, footage emerged of Mr Sunak apparently struggling to pay for a tiny can of Coca-Cola in a shop, because he kept trying to tap his contactless card on the bar code reader. He once in an interview described himself as a “massive Coke addict” - which he quickly claried, meant the drink. But he also revealed he was a cola snob, and prefers the formula only available by importing bottles from Mexico. He won’t touch the Diet or Zero ieties. Evidence of his expensive tastes doesn’t end there.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March  saw him pose up with a £ bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £ a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s.  In pictures released before his  budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £ designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in  that he starts the day with a ride on his £, Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby.  In December , just days after freezing public sector pay for millions of workers, the Mirror revealed he had dined with his we, Akshata Murthy, at Mayfairaposs  Hertford Street - known as Londonaposs most secretive private membersapos club. The Mirror understands Mrs Murthy - whose vast wealth reportedly puts her higher up the rich list than the Queen - planned to hold a surprise party for Mr Sunak’s th birthday at the same private club in , but Covid- restrictions got in the way. Mrs Murthy’s business interests came under the spotlight today amid questions about whether Mr Sunak’s family had benefited from interests in Russia.  Mr Sunak was forced to deny profiting from Vladimir Putin’s regime, after being asked about Mrs Murthy’s reported stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father N.R. Narayana Murthy. Just last week, Mr Sunak warned businesses to “think carefully” about making investments in Russia. But unlike other ministers, Mr Sunak has resisted calls to declare his we’s shareholdings on the Register of Members’ Interests. He insists he “followed the ministerial code to the letter.”  And Mr Sunak’s decision making was called into question long before his failure to deliver help for working families in Wednesday’s mini-Budget. Analysis found his “Eat Out to Help Out” campaign failed to deliver a long-term boost to struggling restaurants and cafes, knocked sideways by the pandemic. Studies did suggest, however, that it helped to push up infections - with the scheme linked to a spike of between  and %.

Ministers attended eight meetings with testing firm Randox - twice as many as previously disclosed - but kept minutes for just two, according to the National Audit Office’s investigation. The firm and its strategic partner Qnostics Ltd were handed £. million with of contracts - % of which were awarded without competition under emergency procurement rules. The firm had former Tory MP Owen Paterson on their payroll as a consultant.And documents released last month revealed he had personally lobbied then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the firm - and asking him to kill news stories making claims about his involvement with the initial £m deal.Before the NAO’s report today, the government had admitted to four ministerial meetings with Randox since the start of the pandemic.  But the NAO identied a further four where the Department of Health and Social Carehad failed to record Randox’s attendance on official transparency releases. They also found documents which “indicated” one-to-one telephone calls between ministers - including Mr Hancock and former le sciences minister Lord Bethell - and representatives of Randox, including Mr Paterson.  DHSC could not confirm to the NAO whether the calls took place, or any notes from the discussions. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: Even taking these exceptional circumstances into account, the documentation of the decision-making process for such large contracts was inadequate.”  Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee added: Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: “Far from vindicating ministers from the Randox scandal, this damning report lays bare the sleaze and cover up running re at the heart of this Conservative Government. “This report shows that Steve Barclay, now No Chief of Staff, misled Parliament over the Randox papers, claiming that the NAO had access to documents when they did not. He must urgently come to Parliament and correct the record. “Ministers also breached their own transparency rules multiple times and failed to identy potential conflicts of interest relating to the first Randox contract. Had this work been done, the dodgy links between Owen Paterson, Tory ministers and Randox could have been identied at an early stage, protecting taxpayersapos money. While the body found no evidence contracts were handed out improperly, the gaps in records meant they were not able to provide positive assurance in the normal way.” The report read: “This report should not be considered as offering positive assurance over any of these contracts which are not detailed in the report or as offering any legal opinion on the use of public procurement regulations.” Despite this, Mr Hancock claimed the report had given ministers a “clean bill of health”, adding “the report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing.”The report noted Mr Hancock had used private email and WhatsApp to discuss Randox with Mr Paterson.He did not disclose all the messages to DHSC officials at the time, telling investigators he did not believe they were “substantive” discussions, and he was not required to do so under Cabinet Office rules. He later made his phone available to investigators and to the department.The report also notes the Information Commissioner is investigating the use of private correspondence channels at DHSC, but has yet to publish its report. DHSC was “unable to provide” key evidence to investigators about decision making - and because notes were not recorded in the department’s existing systems, they had to search several officials’ email accounts to find it. “The Department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other signicant aspects of the procurement,” the report reads. “Including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contact award, and considering of potential conflicts of interest.” Records seen by the NAO suggest officials did not think conflicts of interest rules applied to emergency direct awards. “This reflects an incorrect understanding of the relevant regulations,” the report reads. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: “Mr Hancock warmly welcomes this thorough report by the NAO, which confirms a total clean bill of health on Ministers’ work with Randox during the pandemic. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing - just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity. While the department will no doubt reflect on the technical issues that need to be addressed, the report sets out that Ministers and Officials in the Department were doing their very best to save lives in what was a quick moving and unprecedented situation. Mr Hancockaposs thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones.  Ms Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat. “Over % of testing contracts were awarded to ‘high priority’ companies, including those referred by ministers, MPs or Number . The public needs to trust that their taxes are spent on the basis that it’s what you know, not who you know. “As with many of the COVID response schemes, lessons must be learned about delivering at speed.” A spokesperson for Randox said: “We welcome the finding of the NAO report that there is no evidence of any impropriety in the awarding of government contracts to Randox. “This independent finding vindicates what both Randox and the Government have always said, that these contracts were awarded on merit and in keeping with government protocols and regulations at a time of acute national emergency. “During the pandemic, Randox delivered more than  million gold standard PCR tests, becoming the first laboratory in the world to process more than , tests daily. “In doing so, Randox played its part in helping save tens of thousands of lives, keeping vital sectors of the economy open and enabling essential overseas family and business travel. “The report states that four ministerial meetings took place which were, apparently, not fully documented by the DHSC. “While we cannot comment on government minuting of meetings, Randox can categorically state that the awarding of contracts was not on the agenda at any of these meetings.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppNational Audit OfficeLord BethellGareth DaviesOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonMeg HillierPoliticsSolar powerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The highest inflation in  years and the worst income squeeze on record lie ahead of us.While household finances are taking a hammering, the public finances have actually been on the up: we’re all paying more taxes than the Government expected. Using that headroom, the Chancellor today prioritised rebuilding his tax cutting credentials over support for the low-to-middle income households hardest hit. A p cut to fuel duty will save the typical driving households £ a year, but only reverse  per cent of the increase in pump prices over the past year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section An increase in how much you can earn before you start paying National Insurance will be welcome relief for many, but middle and top income households will gain the most. In fact only £ in every £ of new support goes to the poorer half of families. Giving councils £m to provide emergency support to people struggling just isn’t enough when benefits will fall £bn next year in real terms. Absolute poverty will rise.

Tax receipts as a share of the economy are set to reach their highest level since - – we’re talking the equivalent of a £, rise per household since the  election. Today the Chancellor announced a bigger policy package than expected, but it was badly designed. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually.

Families are facing a devastating a cost of living crisis. And the Chancellor could have helped them out, by scrapping his tax rise on jobs.He could have introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household energy bills. He could have finally brought forward a plan to support British business and create good jobs. That’s what a Labour Government would have delivered. But instead, years of Tory tax rises means that after today the OBR say that we will still have the highest tax burden in  years. Not only that, April will now bring the biggest fall in family incomes since records began.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Even with the Chancellor’s cynical changes, he’s only shaving £ off every £ he’s taxing people. This simply isn’t going to cut it as inflation spirals out of control. Britain’s people needs a government on their side. Instead, we have one that wants to raise taxes and leave working people paying the price. Come April, a landlord with a large number of properties or someone who makes huge sums from buying and selling stocks and shares won’t be paying any more in tax, but their tenants will.

The Conservatives are the party of high taxes, because they are the party of low growth and wasteful spending. The promise of crumbs in two years’ time will be of little comfort to families struggling to pay the bills today. It is timed to suit the Tory party’s interests, not the national interest.

It is meant to provide “organic airborne surveillance and control capability”.  The other is the £.bn Armoured Cavalry programme for  Ajax fighting vehicles. Just  have been delivered and they have given troops hearing problems. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “As NATO leaders meet to respond to Russian aggression, ministers are failing to equip our armed forces with the full kit and equipment to fight and fulfil our NATO obligations.“The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department with no major programme set for delivery on time and on budget, while at least £bn has also been wasted in taxpayers’ money since .“On day one, Labour in government would get the NAO to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value of Money’s tough regime on spending decisions.” Projects in the NAO’s -page “Departmental Overview of the Ministry of Defence”, published last month, have come under fresh scrutiny amid Russia ’s war with Ukraine.Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has triggered tomorrowaposs emergency summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where the Prime Minister is expected to welcome new defence spending pledges by allies - and urge counterparts to go further in supporting Kyiv.But details uncovered by Labour reveal the extent to which Mr Johnson should be worried about defence procurement at home. Multibillion-pound deals are rated in one of five colour-coded categories.  According to Whitehall’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority, green means “successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery signicantly”. But that does not apply to any of the MoD’s schemes. Twelve are given the amber red rating, meaning “successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. “Urgent action is needed to address these problems and or assess whether resolution is feasible.” Fourteen are rated amber, meaning “successful delivery appears feasible but signicant issues already exist, requiring management attention. “These appear resolvable at this stage and,addressed promptly, should not present a cost schedule overrun.” An MoD spokesman said: “Our latest available figures show the majority of MoD’s major projects are capable of being delivered on time and in budget. “We are making the largest investment in our armed forces since the end of the Cold War, with an additional £bn helping ensure they have the equipment they need to meet future threats.” It is understood the most up-to-date figures show % of the MoD’s Government Major Projects Portfolio are rated as amber or better, with problems that,addressed promptly, should not trigger extra costs or delays.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

Gabby Wilson, , from Melbourne in Australia, says she suffered with ious injuries throughout her childhood that stopped her from exercising. By the time she was , she was suffering from a knee injury and weighed nearly  stone - and she knew she had to do something about her weight, news.au reports. Desperate for a solution, Gabby sat down with her dad and asked him to help. Together, the pair discussed weight loss surgery. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Gabby booked a consultation with a surgeon to talk about a gastric sleeve operation, where a large portion of the stomach is removed, leaving a smaller pouch which can only hold small amounts of food at once. “I was so impressed with my surgeon, I booked the surgery that day,” Gabby said. But the procedure didnapost come cheap and Gabby was looking at a bill of more than £, . Luckily, her dad stepped in and used his savings to pay for the operation, which she say she is incredibly grateful for. After the operation, Gabby says the weight began to fall off her and before long sheaposd reached her goal weight of  stone in just seven months.  However, the enormous weight loss in such a short space of time left Gabby with a dferent problem - she had lots of loose skin around her thighs and stomach. “I hated the loose skin, as I was still so young and just didn’t feel comfortable in my body,” she said. My thigh skin would fold and rub on itself when I exercised, it was very painful.” So she turned to her parents once again for help, and together they looked into procedures to remove loose skin. After finding a surgeon she liked, Gabby booked an extended tummy tuck, a medial thigh lt and breast implants.  In total, the operations cost around £,but Gabby doesnapost regret anything and is thrilled with the results. However, recovering from surgery took its toll on her, and she had to spend eight weeks in a full body garment after going under the kne. In addition to the physical dficulties, the intense focus on losing weight and restricting her diet led Gabby to develop an eating disorder. She says she got to a point where she looked incredibly sick and could see her bones through her skin. Her hair also began to fall out and she exercised obsessively for more than an hour every single day. Gabbyaposs supportive parents were there for her once again and she sought help from her GP to begin recovering from her eating disorder. She has improved her relationship with food and gradually regained weight to get to a healthier place - and she has also started studying in sports nutrition. Gabby is now learning about how important it is to fuel the body with good food - she says is the key to feeling human. Ultimately Gabby thinks the financial and emotional support she received from her parents has helped her transform her le and make it through tough times. She said: It has been a lot to overcome and come to terms with, but ultimately it’s been one of the best and most challenging journeys I’ve ever been on.

This weekend will mark the two-year anniversary since the start Max Woosey, , camped out in March .Since then he has camped out at London Zoo,  Downing Street and Twickenham Rugby Stadium and won praise from PM Boris Johnson.And from March , he has raised a staggering £, - which is more than £, including Gt Aid - enough to pay the annual salary of twenty hospice nurses. Maxaposs Big Camp Out will be on Saturday night where he will be joined by celebrity backers including Carol Vorderman and fellow Pride of Britain winners including Hughie and Freddie, Stephen Wharton and Harmonie-Rose Allen. The event will begin at an undisclosed site in Braunton, Devon, on Saturday at pm and will feature live music throughout the day. Despite drawing the formal fundraising to a close, his mum Rachael Woosey said Max was not coming indoors anytime soon - as camping outside had become a way for le for him.  She said: After the two years passes this weekend, we will become a lot more passive. There will be no need to do social media and we will wind the fund raising down. Max will then quietly do this thing and it will become less about fund raising and more just a way of le. It has been two years of his le that has been amazing and a real adventure for him. But I think he maybe just needs a bit of normality and not have people caring about where he sleeps all the time. But he is not coming in though and wants to stay sleeping in his tent. He said he will consider sleeping in a hotelwe go away but that is his only concession. Heaposs happy out there and there would be more distractions inside. Now heaposs at secondary school, Iaposd just rather he was getting a good nightaposs sleep. The efforts of the inspirational schoolboy has been described as insane by the North Devon Hospice.  The sleep out began on March   in memory of Maxaposs friend and neighbour, Rick Abbot, who died in February . Rick, who was , had given Max a tent and told him to have an adventure with it, so he decided to camp out in the garden of his family home in Braunton. Rachael said Maxaposs longevity had surprised many family members but they were incredibly proud of his achievements. She added: A lot of family members thought enough was enough after six months and there was a big pull to get him back inside. As far as we are concernedhe is in fresh air and sleeping well then we donapost have a problem with it. We are all incredibly proud of what he has done and we love he has done it all off his own back. He has shown children can make a dference and have a go at something. It would have been very easy not to have let him have a go but what he has done has been remarkable. He will be out for the full two years so the last night will be on Monday night. It will be quite emotional and I will camp out with him again that night to finish it off. But that will be a private time for us - the big public event to close it is on Saturday. What he has achieved for the hospice has made such a dference. But as an inidual he has also grown in confidence and that will set him up for the future. He has an amazing sense of self now and will carry that forward I am sure. The support we have had from everyone has been amazing and I would like to thank everyone for really getting behind Max the way they have. To achieve so much by sleeping in his tent has been remarkable really. Reflecting on the last year, which also saw him pick up a Pride of Britain award, Max said: The whole thing has been a bit of a dream. I have met so many amazing people and done so many amazing things such as going to Twickenham and  Downing Street. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

It has been incredible and just going to the Pride of Britain was amazing. There has been so many highlights. The tent is now my home and I donapost know how to sleep in bed. I donapost think I would be able to sleep inside now. Max said during the time of his challenge he has slept in  dferent tents. He added: It is just a really nice feeling inside knowing I have helped to raise so much money. I am just really thankful for everyone who has donated.

The council has been left without any legal powers to issue its normal £ penalty notices to drivers using the bus lanes between am and .pm Monday to Saturday. It comes after experimental traffic regulation orders extending the operational hours of bus lanes expired recently without a new permanent order being made to replace them. And from Friday, Hull City council has asked motorists not to use the lanes until the new order is officially in place. However, that is not is not likely to happen until the end of next month at the earliest. The new order is subject to a statutory period of public consultation which runs until April . Any objection would prolong the process. Meanwhile, the council also admitted potentially hundreds of penalty charge notices had wrongly been issued since mid-January because of the mix-up. Itaposs believed some automatic number plate recognition cameras monitoring the bus lanes have been switched off until the new order is legally effective. Despite having no enforcement powers on some routes for two months, the council only acknowledged the issue this week after being approached for a comment by HullLive. Pre-Covid data shows the council received £, from penalty notices issued to drivers who fell foul of bus lane lane rules in  . In a statement, the council said: We will be issuing full refunds to anybody who was wrongly issued with a penalty charge notice in the period between the experimental Traffic Regulation Order expiring and it being replaced by permanent orders. This was as a result of an administrative error and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience.  We will be contacting all affected drivers directly so there is no need to contact us. After a successful trial period, Hull City Councilaposaposs cabinet voted in December to make the am to .pm bus lanes permanent and this is currently being implemented. While this is in progress, we ask drivers not to use the bus lanes. We will begin enforcing the orders as soon as they are made permanent at which point driving in a bus lane will result in a penalty charge notice. Analysis of the extended hours pilot presented to the councilaposs cabinet showed it had delivered an overall nine per cent improvement in bus journey times across the city. Both of Hullaposs main bus operators said they had been able to run quicker and more punctual services as a result. The experimental traffic order covering bus lanes on Ferensway and Spring Bank came into force on  August in  and expired on February  this year. A separate experimental order covering changes to the operational times of other bus lanes in the city came into force on  July in  and expired on  January this year. However, an official notice for a proposed new permanent order was only published on Wednesday of this week. It is a legal requirement to publish notice of proposed new traffic orders in advance of them coming into force. It says: The bus lanes continue to promote the development of sustainable travel, and support an increase in cycling and use of public transport across the city by providing improved connectivity, and a more coherent network along the key corridors linking to the cityaposs strategic cycle network. The scheme will also support the councilaposs air quality and carbon neutral strategies.

Fred Woolerton, , had his le turned upside down when his daughter, Alexis May Woolerton, died on Christmas Eve , in Overgate Hospice after battling cancer aged just . After the devastating lost shook him, he and we Anne-Marie were never the same.As a result, he lost his taste and smell, and said no parent should have to see their child die, he told LeedsLive.Tragically, just two years later we Anne-Marie was diagnosed with lung cancer which sadly spread to her pancreas before reaching her brain. The couple loved going on holiday to Benidorm together, and Anne-Marie loved playing Candy Crush and doing everything for her husband. However after undergoing tireless amounts of treatment, Anne-Marie died on April  . After she was gone I was never the same, Fred admitted. To support Fredaposs challenge click here to donate.  The -year-old granddad felt naturally lost and unmotivated about le. However, he admitted he a good support system around him which has enabled him to get through the dficult times. Fred said: Death creates such an entity behind you. Youaposre in a dark place one minute and then you the other way. You take five steps forward, and then  back. People say that time is a healer but I think while it helps, the key is to have a good structure around you. When people say they understand itaposs nice to say but they donapost understand. I donapost go out half as much now I think sometimes I feel like a burden because people think they canapost have a good time because Iaposm there. Le has got to go on though. Itaposs not fair for me to put that on people. Fred luckily has a number of friends in the community. One vital friend is Adele Kendrew who helps run the Edmund House social club in Pontefract Lane.  She told Fred she would help him get back on his feet by keeping him busy day to day. He began cleaning, painting, and helping sorting out the club which gave him a sense of purpose. Fred added: It helped me come out of my shell and gave me a sense of purpose. It took my mind off it. Itaposs like youaposre acting on a stage and then you come off stage and you have to face reality when you go home. It would all come back to me then. But the club did their absolute best and it did help. People might not think it but Iaposm such a reserved person and itaposs hard to talk about a subject that has taken two members of your family. He wanted to help out his community and give back to families struck down by cancer and he began helping out with Leeds independent charity Maggieaposs. Fred added: Maggieaposs has been open short of three years and I went in and I broke down. Theyaposre really good understanding people. I ask themI could help out, and while they told me itaposs not for everybody I am now able to help people feel comforted, and I speak to them about the hard times. The charity decided to conduct a charity bike ride from Leeds to Barcelona - covering , miles. Fred immediately signed up and will be taking part in the challenge on April  - coincidentally the anniversary of his weaposs death. He said: The date of the bike ride is the day of my weaposs death. Iaposve had my bike sprayed and the colours are the same as the Maggieaposs logo. My bike has both my we and daughteraposs name on. I look at le like a crusade now, not just for me, but I am doing this for everybody and for people who canapost do it. Although since having a knee replacement recently, the brave granddad will travel from Leeds, through to Hull, ferry to Rotterdam, Belgium into France and then ride down into Barcelona through Spain. Fred added: I have seen the dference Maggieaposs makes in peopleaposs lives, and I know it is essential that these centres and charities help support those with cancer and their families. This fundraiser is to help sponsor myself regarding this bike ride, supporting Maggieaposs charity and all of the hard work they do for those who have cancer and the consequences it leaves behind.To support Fredaposs challenge click here to donate.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Itaposs like we ran a very emotional marathon for a long time.  Mrs Anufriieva said she was grateful to those who had been cheering for her during her entire journey but added Ukraine is my home and I hope I canone day. Like many determined and brave Ukrainian citizens, Tanya said her grandmother had initially refused to leave her home of Rivne in the North West of the country. She said: She was adamant she wanted to stay, fight, help, volunteer and weave the safety net. It was only when things started escalating and she started hearing the news that indeed it was a threat that she finally said aposyes I will comeapos, she added. But Tanya claimed it was not an easy task to secure a visa to bring her grandmother to the UK and expressed her concern for others facing similar struggles. She said: A lot of the people who have fled hot zones do not have any of their household bills, any documents that the government is requiring right now to upload a refugee visa. They didnapost have the time. Many of them are now in Eastern Europe with just a passport in their hands. Tanya described the Russian invasion as utterly heartbreaking, adding her grandmother never saw it coming. She was born into the Second World War so she saw the Nazi soldiers. She saw the horrors of sirens, she said. One of them actually put a gun to her face when she was four years old and all these memories have sprang up during this crisis now.

Her mum, Laura Hindle, , watched in disbelief as she was rushed to hospital where she suffered a second stroke, leaving a third of her brain damaged and paralysing the left side of her body. Now eight years old, Victoria still suffers with hemiplegia , causing extreme fatigue and dficulty completing certain tasks.Stay at home mum, Laura told The Mirror : “I still to this day cannot get my head around it, it’s horric. “I had received a call from her school to say that she had taken a bit of a tumble in the playground but she was fine, so I said ‘thanks for letting me know’ and didn’t worry too much. “But then a couple of hours later I got another call to say she was very ill and I needed to come right away because they had called her an ambulance. “When I got there she had completely collapsed, she was just slumped up against one side of the room. She couldn’t talk to me or anything. “When the paramedics got there they asked her to put her hands above her head, but she could only lt her right arm.“Then they asked her to smile and there was a visible drop on one side. “For a split second it crossed my mind ‘she’s had a stroke’. “But then I told myself don’t be ridiculous, children don’t have strokes.” Victoria was rushed to hospital where tests confirmed Laura’s worst fears - she had experienced a stroke, but doctors were unable to determine any trigger or cause. Only the following day, while waiting for a scan with her parents in the hospital, Victoria experienced a second severe stroke, leaving her left side paralysed and damaging  per cent of her brain. Mum of four Laura said: “We were walking down the corridor and she turned around and said ‘my headache is coming back’. “Just as she put her hand to her head, she collapsed. “I had never heard of a child having a stroke, I was in shock, we couldn’t get to grips with what the doctors were talking about until they showed us her scans and we saw the damage. “To actually witness my child’s face visibly dropping on one side was horric, it was like something out of a horror film.” After extensive research, Laura has discovered a machine which would give Victoria the use of her arm again, by stimulating the nerves which send messages to the limb from the brain.Victoria has already benefited from temporary use of the Saebo-stimulator Pro machine in the weeks after her strokes while recovering at The Children’s Trust for children with brain injuries. But now Laura is desperate to give her daughter a “normal le” after admitting that some children have already started teasing Victoria for her injury.Now Laura has set up a GoFundMe to raise £, for the machine and therapy to help Victoria, with any proceeds spent on further rehabilitation which could aid a normal lestyle.She said: “People that don’t know Victoria might just think that she has had an injury because of her walk. “But she experiences extreme fatigue and she has a tendency to fall over a lot. “She’s already had some grief from other kids being unkind saying things like ‘you can’t play with us because you only have one arm’. “It’s dficult because children often don’t understand things they can’t see and a stroke is something you can’t see.“It’s heartbreaking to watch her sometimes because she wants so badly to be able to do something as simple as remove a pen lid without having to ask someone to do it for her, or putting her school tie on. “She’s such a bright and bubbly little girl, she loves dancing and playing just like any other child her age. “I want her to have access to everything anyone can expect from a normal le like being able to do her makeup when she gets older. “I always tell her, you’re no dferent to anybody , you just need a bit more time.”To donate to Victoria’s fundraiser, click here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON StrokeHospitalsTherapy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The furniture giant today published findings of a probe into surveillance cameras placed above  bathrooms at a distribution centre in Peterborough. Bosses installed cameras in toilet ceiling voids in November  to monitor staff membersapos alleged drug use and provision of  urine samples. But the investigation revealed that two cameras became dislodged and accidentally filmed communal areas in both a female and male bathroom. No footage was captured of toilet cubicles. An IKEA spokesperson said: Whilst the intention at the time was to ensure the health and safety of co-workers, we understand the fact that colleagues were filmed unknowingly in these circumstances will have caused real concern.  ‘For this we are sincerely sorry,” they continued. The cameras were operational until July  and were not recording when staff found them last September, the investigation said. It added that no CCTV was recorded in toilet cubicles and that footage showing staff in bathrooms was only seen during the independent investigation. An IKEA spokesperson added: Their [the camerasapos] installation followed serious concerns about the use of drugs onsite, which, owing to the nature of work carried out at the site, could have very serious consequences for the safety of our co-workers. The cameras placed within the voids were positioned only to record irregular activity in the ceiling voids. They were not intended to, and did not, record footage in the toilet cubicles themselves. “However, as a result of ceiling tiles becoming dislodged, two cameras inadvertently recorded footage of the communal areas of two bathrooms for a period of time in . The footage was not viewed at the time and was only recovered as part of these investigations. IKEA said it had passed the reportaposs findings onto the Information Commissioneraposs Office, the UK regulator for data privacy.

TV footage showed him scoffing down a pepperoni pizza and chatting with several military personnel. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here But Biden complained he was blocked from crossing the border to Ukraine.In an emotional speech, he also mentioned his grandfather and his late son Beau Biden who was an Iraq War veteran. Like you, he didnapost have to go either... the point is there are hundreds of thousands of people like my son, like all of you, so thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, he said. We have a sacred obligation in this government... to equip those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home, he said.  It comes as Biden was due to be briefed on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine. Biden told reporters in Brussels yesterday that his visit to Poland will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. The US President is due to travel to Warsaw to have talks with Polandaposs President Andrzej Duda. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan appeared to the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.During an emergency NATO summit in Brussels yesterday, leaders agreed to step up measures to protect Ukraine and members of the -country alliance from a Russian chemical or nuclear attack. Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: Today we agreed to do more including cyber-security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. Mr Stoltenberg said Natoaposs chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements had been activated and we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves. Asked whether the move was based on credible intelligence, Mr Stoltenberg said: We are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext - accusing Ukraine, the United States, Nato allies - for preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged NATO chiefs to send tanks and warplanes to his war-torn country so forces can repel Russian invaders.In a passionate video link plea to an emergency summit at the coalition’s headquarters, he warned leaders from the organisation’s  member countries that delays to vital equipment were costing lives. He fumed: “You have thousands of fighter jets but we havenapost been given any yet. “We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others - cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and articially creating famine no water, no food, nothing there. “You have at least , tanks Ukraine asked for a per cent - one per cent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us - but we do not have a clear answer yet. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoU.S. ArmyJens StoltenbergJoe BidenNATO summitSoldiersPizzaOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, she tried to use the toilet as the branch was shutting down but was left “fuming” after she was told it was store policy not to let anyone use them after the tannoy had sounded.The chain apologised to the -year-old, and insisted that she should have been allowed to use it,Teesside Live reported.Instead of letting Ms Smith use the toilet, she was forced to endure an uncomfortable hour-plus long drive home before she could finally go to the toilet. She slammed the decision as “daft” not to let her go and that she was “full of tea”.  She said: It wasnapost like we had just come off the streets, we were actually in the shop and paying customers”. After she had splashed out in the city centre restaurant she was flabbergasted that staff wouldn’t let her go to the toilet. She said: We came out the restaurant having tea and cake, so three of us said aposWe have to go as the shopaposs closingapos. “So we got up and walked towards the toilet, around  yards away on the same floor, and we saw this lad in his Hi-vis coat. As we walked towards the toilet, a couple of girls came out and then the Tannoy announcer said aposThe shopaposs closing in ten minutes, can you make your way to the checkouts.’ “But when we got to the toilet he said we couldnapost come in once they made the ten minute announcement.At the time we were so polite, but we should have said aposDonapost be so daftapos and walked past - what would he have done  But we didnapost because we are too nice. But I was fuming, absolutely fuming - and busting. To help her, her daughter tried to take her to a public convenience, only to find that it too had shut. They said it has marred what had otherwise been a “lovely” day, and when she made it home she fired off a complaint to MS. However, the national chain didn’t reply until Teeside Live raised her concerns with the high street giant. Since then ,a spokesperson for the firm claried that the toilets should always remain open to customers as long as the store is.  We were sorry to hear about Ms Smith’s experience. At MS we hold ourselves to the highest standards of customer service and our toilets are available for customers to use whenever our store is open., they added. We are contacting Ms Smith directly to apologise and our store manager would like to offer her some flowers next time she visits the store.” And Sue also claims that, days later, the firm eventually did reply - and also offered her a £ voucher. However Sue said she spoke out about her experience not for some freebie, but to point out the poor experience she had - and to make sure it doesnapost happen to anyone . If we had just come off the street and asked aposCan we use your toiletsapos, Iaposd understand itthey said we couldnapost as the shopaposs closing. That would be a bit cheeky. But we were already in there. It just spoilt a lovely afternoon we had shopping.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Customer service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rachel Wilson, from St Helens, had to stop driving and leave her job - but still had no idea what was wrong with her. Medical officials repeatedly told her that her symptoms were just anxiety - leaving Rachel fearing that she was going aposcrazyapos. Eventually, she issued a desperate plea on Facebook, asking friends and family for help identying her symptoms. Incredibly, a chance conversation with a friend who saw her post led the mum to discover she had epilepsy. Speaking to the Mirror, she recalled the first time she suffered a seizure - while driving with her son Sonny. She said: It was completely out of the blue, I was driving to Manchester with my little boy in the car.Luckily, we were in traffic lights, and I just had this with a weird sensation.Almost like I was going to faint and I opened the windows. It was really strange.On the way home, I had another one and we were on the motorway and I was completely paralysed, I couldnapost even indicate for the junction we needed to get off at. I was having them every time, while I was working. I couldnapost put my finger on it. After visiting the doctors, she was diagnosed with sinusitis and underwent surgery which made no dference and then sent for allergy testing. But when the pandemic struck - she struggled to access help, and her mental health noseed. She said: I was misdiagnosed for a long time, and due to the prolonged misdiagnosis, I was made to feel like it was psychological. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereAt times, I felt like I was going crazy. In the beginning, my symptoms werenapost taken seriously. I wasn’t sent for any tests and so the diagnosis was delayed.I was given other diagnoses that were minor in comparison to epilepsy, ones which required a lot less investigation. My seizures were put down to sinus problems, an allergy and then anxiety.I was placed on a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications and told that once the depression eased, then the aposanxiety attacksapos which were actually seizures would also settle down.The GP never referred me to anyone . During the pandemic, she struggled further as she was never offered a video or virtual appointment.Rachel said: For a long time, the seizures were described as aposa classic case of anxiety attacksapos due to a mental and nervous breakdown…that I had suffered  years after starting with the seizures.It was only when I spoke to a dferent GP that she was concerned and sent me to AE. This was after four and a half years of seizures.I was diagnosed in December  with epilepsy and frontal lobe cavernoma. I was absolutely devastated I couldnapost see any future with such a lelong diagnosis.I felt angry that this had happened to me, I felt desperately sad. I felt guilty, that I had failed my family, that I wasnapost the woman that my husband had married and that neither of us had signed up to this.I was worried that le would never be the same and that my son deserved more than me as his Mama. I was angry that this could have been diagnosed a long time ago and that by now I would have accepted and come to terms with it. I worried about finances, too. I had recently lost my job due to ill health and then I knew I’d have to surrender my driving licence. I knew it would really dficult for my husband to stay in the same job role.I worried about having to rely on other people to do things for me, things that I once seemingly took for granted. I had heard of epilepsy, but it turns out I knew very little. I had a preconception that all seizures were physical and that it was always caused by flashing lights.When I was diagnosed, I realised that flashing lights affect a minority and that the term ‘invisible disabilities’ now applies to me. I have absence seizures. I get an aura of a rising in my stomach, almost like Iaposm on a fairground ride. It’s a rising burning sensation from my stomach to my chest.I usually have time to say aposIaposm having a feelingapos until I go into the seizure. I have always called them aposfeelingsapos because for over  years I didnapost know what they were and how to describe them to my young son.It was important for him to be aware that they were happening, and calling them feelings didnapost sound as scary for him. Once the aura is over, I quickly go into a zoned-out state.I am completely paralysed and unable to move any part of my body, including blinking. I have been told I have a certain vacant look. I stare into space and Iaposm not able to communicate. Everything around me is intensied, noises sound unbearably loud, voices sound distorted, I become really cold with goosebumps. This lasts for approximately  minutes, and then I become really hot, sweating and Iaposm wiped out and exhausted. The more I have the more tired I am.I can fall asleep suddenly and usually by the time it passes I then have another one quickly after. We have all been shocked. I have felt supported. I have found that with a diagnosis, people have been a lot more accepting of what have turned out to be seizures.No-one knows what another person is going through, but people have a lot of love and support to give. Since diagnosis, it feels amazing to have people listen, believe and understand what I have been feeling for so long.The worries and lack of understanding on my part impacted my mental health. I am currently under a neurologist and a neurosurgeon for the cavernoma.Now she hasnapost had a seizure since th January, after starting medication, and says she is starting to remember the person I was before this started and I see light at the end of tunnel.” As many as , people in the UK are facing an epilepsy diagnosis this year, but Epilepsy Action warns many are struggling to get the information they need. Tom Beddow, advice and information services manager at Epilepsy Action, said: “The impact of epilepsy is huge, and goes way beyond initial diagnosis.Even before the pandemic hit, neurology services were one of the least funded, most stretched areas of the NHS.“Now, two years on, we have a surge in people seeking our help, fresh from being diagnosed over the phone, sometimes in as little as  minutes.Many are being left to their own devices, struggling to find support, not knowing their rights or their rrisks.To coincide with Purple Day on  March, the global awareness day for epilepsy, Epilepsy Action has released a video sharing the overwhelming panic and confusion that can follow an epilepsy diagnosis.

The now-infamous bit of road has left many people red-faced and a few quid down while travelling from England to North Wales on holiday. The stretch on the A between Abergwyngregyn and Talybont, Gwynedd, in Wales, has left one driver so incensed he urged people not to drive down it unless theyaposre aware of the speed restrictions.One motorist Anthony Martindale penned a letter in frustration to the Liverpool Echo, the Daily Post reports.Mr Martindale was caught speeding in both directions between junctions  and , even though all lanes were open and no construction work was being carried out - earning himself a £ fine, three points on his licence and ordered to take a drivers awareness course costing £.  He said: The construction workers had made sure everything was safe when they stopped work on the Friday evening, so health and safety was not an issue.“All four lanes were open so there was no disruption to traffic. Yet the North Wales Police still saw fit to continue letting the traffic continue at mph when it was safe to resume the statutory speed of mph.“On the westbound, I was caught doing mph and on the eastbound I was doing mph. It seems I was not alone thinking that it was actually safer to travel faster on that stretch of road because on that particular Sunday,  people were caught, myself included.” Temporary speeding restrictions are in place along the road as part of a £m scheme to improve safety along part of the .km stretch of carriageway.  Access roads are being removed and eight gaps in the central reservation are being plugged, while a new parallel road, with underpass, is being built for farm vehicles. Mr Martindaleaposs expensive trip prompted a Freedom of Information request to police which showed over six weekend - from January  to February  - a total of  speeding fines were handed out between junctions  and . On January , the worst day for speeding drivers,  were dished out, with numbers tailing off after that. On the weekend from February  to February , no fines were handed out - but only as all temporary signs were removed after a severe weather warning.Worst day for fines was on January  when  fines were awarded. Thereafter, motorists became wiser to the restrictions and the number of fines tailed off. On the weekend of February -, no fines were dished out – but only because all temporary signs were removed after a severe weather warning. Mr Martindale wants to warn holidaymakers to be aware of suffering the same consequences he did. He said: “If any readers are planning to go to North Wales over the summer months, they need to be made aware that at the roadworks on the A at junction  and , anyone going faster than mph will be photographed and fined.” On this stretch of the road, a Temporary Traffic Order restricts speeds to mph through the works. A mph speed limit is also in place on the approaches to the works. These restrictions are operational  hours-a-day. A Welsh Government spokesman said: “Narrow lanes and a mph speed restriction were implemented on the eastbound carriageway during March  and on the westbound carriageway during October . These restrictions were introduced to protect both the travelling public and the workforce.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the coronavirus pandemic could delay diagnosis and treatment, meaning more undetected cases.Her warning comes after provisional data revealed , cases of TB were recorded in England last year.While Dr Laura Cleghorn, of the University of Dundee warned there is a pressing need to develop new treatments for the illness which some wrongly think of as a disease of yesteryear.The bacterial infection is spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.Treatment for the illness has come a long way but it is still a potentially serious condition which needs to be cured using antibiotics, according to the NHS website.Have you tested positive for TB during the Covid pandemic  Let us know at webnews@mirror In , worldwide deaths due to TB ranked second only to Covid, in terms of infectious disease.Dr Harries told the BBC: It is important to remember not every persistent cough, along with fever, is Covid-.A cough that usually has mucus and lasts longer than three weeks can be caused by a range of other issues, including tuberculosis.Meanwhile, campaigners fear the pandemic and conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, have set back crucial funding to halt the spread. Todayis World Tuberculosis Day, with charity the Stop TB Partnership calling for an urgent and substantial increase of funding to fight TB in order to meet the goal of ending the disease by . Dr Lucica Ditiu, the organisationaposs executive director, said:We simply cannot continue to stand on the sidelines and watch while people around the world fall ill and die from a preventable and treatable disease.We also cannot continue to accept what we accepted for years - every year having less than % of the funding need for the TB response. Now we are facing a disastrous funding shortfall, bigger than what we had expected. We not only need to step up efforts to meet targets set at the  UNHLM on TB, but the TB response must also recover from the devastating impacts of the Covid- pandemic. The Stop TB Partnership also warned the Ukraine invasion could have devastating impacts on health services, including the war-torn nationaposs TB treatment programme. The charity is urging all countries taking Ukrainian refugees to put the correct provisions in place to treat those who need it. Last year, Ukraine treated , people with TB including , with a drug-resistant form of the illness. In Britain, a requirement for Ukrainians to take a TB test before arrival has been waived for those on the family scheme visa - though such people will get medical care and testing from GPs.

As a former Olympian herself, the Queen aposs daughter was part of the team who worked tirelessly to bring the prestigious sporting event to the UK. The Princess Royal worked incredibly hard in securing the bid, and was said to be absolutely integral in ensuring the UK was successful - and it certainly wasnapost plain sailing.In fact, Anne did make one very serious error in the build up to the games, which couldaposve completely overshadowed all the hard work sheaposd already put in.  The princess, who became the first member of the royal family to compete in the Olympics in , was caught making a rude comment about one of her fellow committee members when she forgot to turn off her microphone.Sebastian Coe shared the story, which he admits is one of his favourites, during an ITV documentary, Anne: The Princess Royal at , which was released in .Speaking about her contribution to the Olympics, he said: It was always to the point, she doesnapost always suffer fools gladly, she doesnapost speak for the sake of speaking. I do remember, after a rather long-winded interjection by one of the committee members, she had actually forgotten to turn her microphone off. She managed to mutter the immortal words: aposI think this person is probably the most stupid person in world sportapos.

However, despite the embarrassing blunder Anne managed to stay completely calm and styled it out in the most professional manner. Mr Coe continues: This echoed around the room and she never flinched.

Speaking after we awarded the games in , she said: I really think the team have earned it, theyaposve done a fantastic job.

Instead, she has had nothing but trouble. Her once strong physique is decidedly frail after hurting her back in October . This year she has had to cancel all her public appearances including the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey because in her own words, “I can’t move!”.She is determined to be at her late husband’s memorial on Tuesday however hard it is for her to get there. She knows he would expect it as much as she knows he would be angry and disappointed Prince Harry has chosen not to go.The memorial service will honour the Duke of Edinburghaposs dedication to “family, nation and Commonwealth”, his contribution to public le and his steadfast support to his charities, Buckingham Palace has said. Members of the royal family, more than  foreign royals, the duke’s wider family and friends, and  representatives from his patronages and charities will gather in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, the youth scheme set up by Philip in , will feature prominently, with a special tribute delivered by a Gold Award holder.Ingrid also believes the negative headlines around her grandson would have been dficult for the Queen to handle, especially with everything going on. Yesterday there was another hearing in his latest legal battle, this time against the Home Office over his police protection in the UK. A High Court judge ruled that parts of documents in the case will remain secret. Ingrid writes: Negative headlines about her grandson Prince Harry and accusations against her favourite son Prince Andrew have made unhappy reading for Her Majesty. Prince Harry’s legal disputes have been continuous and his wrangle with the British government over his royal protection when he is in the UK is ongoing. The Queen would be forgiven for feeling her family are jinxed. Even the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have run into dficulties on their Platinum Jubilee tour of the Caribbean. What should have been all smiles and flag waving has turned into protests about slavery exacerbated by the impending th anniversary of Jamaica’s independence, the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.In his address at the Governor General’s banquet William choose his words carefully echoing the same sentiments as his father had done in Barbados as he talked about the ‘appalling atrocity’ of the slave trade. The couple were well briefed to expect some controversy so were not surprised when the prime minister expresses his sentiments about Jamaica – a country which has always loved the Queen - becoming a republic. It might have been kinderhe had waited until after her Platinum Jubilee celebrations to make his point, but of course she understood. It has been a grim few months. Even Prince Charles, now head of the family, has invited scandal by allowing his former aide Michael Fawcett, once chief executive of the Princes Foundation to allow wealthy doners to expect honours for substantial cash donations. I feel these family setbacks will make the Queen more determined than ever to attend Prince Philip’s memorial next Tuesday. She needs to be seen andshe is in a wheelchair – it doesn’t matter. Once again, she will be leading by example and showing the nation that it is OK not to be OK. Confirming details of the service in a statement on Thursday, Buckingham Palace said: Members of the Royal Family will attend a Service of Thanksgiving for the le of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, th March. The Service will give thanks for The Duke of Edinburgh’s dedication to family, Nation and Commonwealth and recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces. The Service will in particular pay tribute to The Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to public le and steadfast support for the over  charitable organisations with which His Royal Highness was associated throughout his le.

People enjoyed more sweltering weather on Thursday where the mercury once again hit C with the hottest part of the country being east Yorkshire.The high pressure system is sitting firmly over the UK and promising plenty more blue skies and sunshine for Friday and into the weekend with widespread temperatures in the high teens and reaching C. It means sun lovers are set to pack beaches up and down the country and beer gardens are likely to be bustling. Anyone looking for sun won’t need to head to southern Europe this week with it having been warmer in the UK than the Costas. But unfortunately it is to be short-lived with BBC weather predicting another cold snap around the corner.And maps from WXCharts shows lows of -C in several centimetres of snow at the end of next week in Scotland. “There are some big changes in the weather pattern on the way but not just yet,” said BBC forecaster Darren Bett. “On Thursday despite the haziness of the sunshine temperatures reached C in East Yorkshire, the warmest place in the country. It was a few degrees cooler than that in Scotland and Northern Ireland where we did see more cloud and we still have a weak weather front draped in the Northern Isles bringing some damp weather here. Otherwise it is high pressure that is dominating the weather.  With that stagnant air and no mixing we are continuing to see some poor air quality and we are going to find some high levels of air pollution again across eastern parts in particular on Friday. There is due to be a cold start to Friday before the temperatures rise as has been the case all week. Under that high pressure and clear skies we start the day on a chilly note as we have done on the past few days, said Mr Bett. Temperatures in rural areas will not be far away from freezing. There maybe a few pockets of frost and fog to start the day across Scotland and Northern Ireland but away from Northern Isles there is set to be more sunshine for Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday. Plenty of sunshine for England and Wales.  He continued: Dry and largely sunny day and quite warm again for the time of year C maybe C for England and Wales. The high pressure is still there across the UK on Saturday. By Sunday, though, and there are set to be more clouds and the temperatures will be a few degrees cooler but still in the mid-teens. Then it is expected to get a lot colder. Into next week though and this is where we see signicant changes not least because we are going to start to see a northerly wind moving down and that will really drop the temperatures, said Mr Bett. As the high recedes early next week we have got the chance of seeing some rain and then that northerly wind arrives it will be much colder by day and also by night.” UK forecast for the next  days Staying fine and dry for most Today: Fine, dry and sunny for most and feeling warm. Cloudier for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Some rain developing over the Northern Isles and perhaps an isolated afternoon shower over Northern Ireland. Tonight: Dry, clear and chilly for most with some mist and haze for east and southeast England. Cloudier in far N and NW with some light rain for the Northern Isles. Saturday: Fine, sunny and feeling warm for most. Breezier in the south making it cool on some coasts. Cloudier in the north with a little rain for the Northern Isles. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Areas of low cloud and patchy fog retreating to coasts on Sunday less warm across England and Wales. A few showers developing on Monday before turning colder from the north.

The UK has basked in weather warmer than Spanish hotspots Marbella and Lanzarote on Thursday as the mercury hold strong again today.Met Office forecasters say much of the weekend will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.However, by Tuesday things will become unsettled as a cold air mass will push itself North across the UK. Over the weekend, long spells of sunshine can be expected in the South. Other regions will see a continuation of the dry, settled weather that many have seen over in recent days.  Over Saturday, most can expect light winds and sunshine, with only a risk of an isolated shower in the far north of Scotland. In South West England and Wales, clear skies and temperatures of around C are forecasted. Sunday follows a similar theme and by Monday temperatures will start to drop slightly but will remain dry and fine for most. By Tuesday, more unsettled and cooler weather picture from the middle of next week.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days.  “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” Ahead of next week, the mini-heatwave is set to continue over the weekend. Temperatures are well above the average on Friday afternoon, with the mercury hitting C in London and Birmingham. Looking ahead to the next few days, Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: It may well be the shortest weekend of the year, because the clocks go forward, but it will be one of the sunniest. Itaposs going to be blue skies almost across the board on both Saturday and Sunday thanks to a chunky area of high pressure thataposs just wobbling around across the UK.

And one mum is reminding everyone to take care - especially around boiling water.Salon owner Amber Bowles says she was left apostraumatisedapos after having an accident in the kitchen while rustling up roast gammon for Sunday lunch. The -year-old from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk accidentally spilt boiling water down herself while draining a pan of par-boiled potatoes and ended up aposburning offapos a tattoo. Amber says the horric accident was caused when she caught the handle of the pan on the hob grate.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. The mum-of-one ended up pouring boiling water down her right arm as a result - accidentally getting it all over her half tattoo sleeve of a woman and a floral design.She ended up with a severe third-degree burn, with huge blisters bubbling up on a x-inch patch on her arm, causing nerve damage and aposburning offapos part of her tattoo. Amberaposs partner, -year-old salesman Zack Brown rushed her to James Paget Hospitalaposs AE department where doctors popped and scraped the blisters before applying antibacterial cream and burns dressings.Given the severity of the injury, Amber then had to visit a specialist burns hospital where was told she may need a skin graft, but luckily she healed well enough that she didnapost need one. The injury was so painful Amber found herself unable to work in her salon over Christmas - one of the busiest periods of the year for beauty treatments. Now, four months on from her ordeal back in November, Amber is urging people to be aposmore waryapos in the kitchen so they donapost go through the agonising experience she did. She said: The accident has burned the tattoo off. Iaposve got a womanaposs face and a big flower. Half her head is missing and then half of the flower and all the leaves has gone as well. The doctors didnapost think it would go that deep to take the tattoo off, they thought the tattoo would come back, but the burn went quite deep so it took all of the ink out of the skin. It went that deep it damaged all my nerve endings too. I was really traumatised by it.  Amber continued: I usually do a roast every Sunday, itaposs a meal Iaposm really good at making and something I enjoy doing. In the last year Iaposve been really trying to nail the roast dinners. I was doing roast potatoes. I peeled all the potatoes, put them in a big silver pot to boil with salt and a bit of oil before I put them in the oven. I went to pick the big pot up but the handles were too hot so I grabbed a tea towel and picked the pot up. It contained water that had been boiling for about  minutes. The tea towel then got caught and the whole of the pot went all over my right arm, hand, thumb and wrist. I just remember this excruciating pain. I donapost know how I even managed it but I managed to put the pot back down and then screamed for my partner and my mum.  I got to the tap as quickly as I could and I put it under the cold water tap. Iaposve given birth [was in labour] for  hours and that wasnapost even on par with that.It felt like my arm was on fire. As soon as I saw my arm under the cold water tap my skin was just peeling off and thataposs when I knew it was bad.My whole body went into shock and I was just screaming. Zack came down, he was just as shocked as I was. I had it under the water for  minutes and then he rushed me to hospital. Once I got to hospital thataposs when I started to get blisters, there were about eight or nine and they were big - some were the size of a £ coin. I thought it was best to leave them but they popped them and then peeled all the skin back, which was awful. It was absolutely agonising. I was there for about an hour, they were pretty quick and were really good. Amber admits that after the accident she initially didnapost cook again for a while but sheaposs now back in the kitchen and wants to urge others to be aposmore waryapos and take their time. She added: It wasnapost very nice losing my tattoo but because they thought I was going to have to have a skin graft I was trying to look at things positively. Iaposm glad itaposs taken half of my tattoo off rather than burn my face or my daughter. I couldnapost believe Iaposd done it, I still canapost. After I did it I didnapost cook for a while, I didnapost go near a hob. Now Iaposm ok but Iaposm very wary. Before I burned myself Iaposd be doing multiple things at once and rushing. Now I do not rush, I take my time and make sure my little girlaposs not there just in case. My advice to people is to be more wary when in the kitchen.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

She said on Reddit: I told her absolutely not. She said she won’t be coming unless the dog can come too.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Originally wanting her sister to be a bridesmaid, the woman, who is due to marry in six monthsapos time, is now struggling to maintain her guest list as her sister is trying to turn their family against her following the ban. I told her she was being ridiculous. The dog isn’t even trained and there is nothing medically wrong with her, she added.She says it’s for PTSD from our childhood. We had an exceptionally normal childhood with great parents. We never financially struggled or anything like that and were never abused.She is now refusing to come to the wedding and trying to get family members to take her side. She is saying I am discriminating against her disability - PTSD and anxiety caused from a super normal childhood. Claiming her sisteraposs service dog is fake, the bride-to-be explained how her sister adopted the dog as a puppy and started referring to it as a service dog in training so her landlord would allow her to keep him. She added: Now she has herself convinced that she actually needs this dog and that he is performing some kind of therapy for her.  The problem is the dog is not a trained service dog. It barks, it will rub up against you and get slobber and hair on you. Itaposll scratch up your legsit’s excited. I think the whole service dog thing is her way of feeling special, standing out and getting attention from others.She loves the attention the dog brings and it’s super obvious. The dog has its own Instagram for goodness sake.I’m also worried that she will use the dog to steal the attention on my wedding day. She has done this at family birthday parties with the dog and other events. She literally needs people to pay attention to her and her dog. Questioning whether she has been too harsh on her sister or whether her reasoning is justied, the woman has turned to Reddit to seek othersapos opinions.One user said: People like you sister are incredibly annoying for people like me who have actual trained service dogs, and give service dogs a bad rap. My dog helps me with my autism and mental illnesses. I have a hard time navigating crowds and so he is trained to lead me around when I get overwhelmed, along with doing some other stuff. It is incredibly annoying when people think I might be faking him being a service dog because of people like your sister. While some users supported the bride-to-beaposs decision to ban the dog from attending her wedding, others pointed out how her dismissible behaviour towards her sisteraposs mental health might be the reason for her problems. Pretending to speak through the bride, one user said: Dear family, Iaposve just learned that I am the source of sisteraposs PTSD and childhood trauma. I am shocked and sad as I thought we had a wonderful childhood. I cannot in good conscience force sister to attend my wedding. She was gracious enough to try to put her trauma aside, but it is exacerbating her need for her service animal. Please help me support her by supporting her non attendance and not talking about wedding details in front of her. Love you all so much! Another user added: She sounds extremely dismissive of her sister and I really wondersheaposs ever considered that this behaviour could be a cause of her childhood trauma too, especiallyshe has always regarded her sister this way. A fourth user said: Please remember that not all PTSD suffers are affected in the same way. Your symptoms may not affect you to such an extent that they constitute a disability but for others their panic attacks can be completely deliberating.

So, the -year-old decided to pitch the idea of the nomad lestyle, living from a van, to her fiancé, Alan, who has actually lived that way before - in a bid to see the world on a budget. The couple had been living in a small flat at the time, and managed to save enough money to buy a Mercedes Vario d minibus for £, in July , which they called aposBlue.apos  Marie said: As experienced trekkers and overall outdoor enthusiasts, we wanted a le that gave us freedom to find a place to hike, climb or kayak and just go. For someone with an adventurous background, staying indoors was a real challenge and I felt it truly impacted my well-being – both mentally and physically. I got furloughed and the lack of mental stimulation didn’t help at all. I wanted a way of le that would be more engaging than the mainstream: job, commute, flat. So, the couple packed up their things, gave up the flat and began travelling across Scotland, including the islands, in their new home Blue. But they have found themselves unable to fully satisfy their wanderlust and travel across the world so far – with the rising cost of living and fuel prices a contributing factor.  Marie continued: With fuel prices being so high at the moment, there’s more importance than having a constant adventure. Obviously the idea of being non-stop on the road is appealing, but the certainty that comes from a regular income is important. Fortunately though, the couple are still managing to save plenty of money thanks to their unique way of le. Living in the van is saving them an estimated £, a month in rent and between £- in council tax and bills. They spend £ a week on water disposal and water but are largely self-reliant – with electricity generated from solar  in the van. Despite being limited to the local area for now, the couple have still managed to turn their unusual abode into a home. Although the bus was already converted, the couple added their own touch by replacing the handles for £ and the original colour scheme for £.

She said: The previous owners of the bus already did a superb job by converting it using wood and carving details all around. We love detail and our work is more an add-on with dferent paint schemes, hardware and soft furnishings. The bus is a canvas of our lives and we are trying to craft the bus so that every corner reflects a part of our personalities and tastes. In total, they have spent £ making the vehicle feel like home and managed to keep costs low by re-using decor from their previous flat. For now, despite their lack of travel plans, the adventurous couple have no plans toto rented accommodation. Marie said: Van le makes you feel independent and more confident in yourself as it forces you to deal with breakdowns, climate and nature. You feel more engaged with your le and in a sense, more in control. It’s helped me to re-find a path and series of goals when my le hit a standstill. The positives about this way of le is a sense of freedom, which is met by daily challenges. Everything can and will break in a van, but patience, a good dose of humour and the ability to learn quickly will turn hassles into fun. It doesn’t need to be full-on straight away to be enjoyable and it can be done on a wide range of budgets. Everybody on the road has their own story and reasons to take this way of le, but I would advise anyone to start by hiring a van first for a weekend or short holiday. Get the feel for it first andyou decide to take the step, always make sure you know where your next pay check will come from. A vehicle does break more often than a house and bills can rapidly pile up. Travel slowly and take time to explore the mountains – it feels great not to feel rushed to reach the next destination.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Weaposve also been shown how The Range has a hidden name within its name, which can be seenyou take a closer look at the iconic logo. And now shoppers have just realised that high street homeware store Dunelm used to be called something dferent.The store is said to have undergone a massive rebrand in  when the name and logo became what we know and love today.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.However, before then it was called Dunelm Mill and the logo was a lighter shade of green. Do you remember that  This came to light on social media earlier this week, as a journalist named Mared Parry tweeted: Was Dunelm once called Dunelm Mill or did I completely make this s**t up A number of fellow Twitter users responded, with many stunned by this piece of information.One person asked: Since when  Wait, what  another wrote. Someone  agreed with Mared, saying: Just found an old Dunelm Mill bag earlier ..... Its now en route to America as its used as inner wrapping for a gt. And Dunelm themselves got involved in the conversation, clarying that they were Dunelm nee Mill. So their former name was Dunelm Mill when the company opened their first bricks and mortar store back in . This was changed  years ago, according to the Dunelm careers site, to reflect what customers had been calling the company for years. And theyaposre not the only ones who had a name change - Home Bargains also used to be called something . The store was originally called Home and Bargain until . Last year they fooled everyone with an April Foolsapos joke that they were reverting back to their old name. They shared a snap of a mocked-up store with the dferent branding adding: Yes, Home and Bargain is coming back!Do you have a story to share  We want to hear from you.

There they discussed the biggest issues surrounding extra-terrestrial le, and now Nick has lted the lid - and it turns out an alien invasion will likely be a bad thing. What do you think about Nickaposs revelation  Let us know in the comments...Nick, from Calornia, spoke out during Blaze TVaposs Indistinguishable From Magic, and said: If we find aliens, or they find us, the world will change forever. With all the possibilities and all the iables, how can we know what will happen or even attempt to predict what the effects will be  As it happens, some of the deepest thinkers on the face of the planet have had detailed discussions on these very questions. Their answers may surprise you, and yet whataposs most surprising of all, is how few people know these discussions have taken place. Donapost worry, I was there.  The two meetings, held in , were called aposthe detection of extra-terrestrial le and the consequences for science and societyapos, and apostowards a scientic and societal agenda on extra-terrestrial leapos. He said one of the biggest questions asked on the day was aposhow would people react apos Nick continued: Itaposs a question that comes up again and again, relating to disclosure, and itaposs cited by many as being a reason why governments might want to cover up the truth about UIFPOs, the question is this - How would people respond   Not our political leaders, or our greatest scientists, but everyday folk - teachers, store workers, farmers, or factory workers. Would there be wonder, quiet acceptance, or might there be panic in the streets  If we discover alien le, many people think there would be mass panic -we faced an alien invasion as happens in science fiction movies such as Independence Day or War of the Worlds, clearly that would be true.  Delegates of the Royal Society suggested that an announcement that extraterrestrial le had been discovered would have little effect. Opinion polls already show that large numbers of people believe in alien le with many being certain weaposre already being visited, and further belief that our political leaders arenapost telling us everything that they know about UFOs. The bottom line is you donapost shock people by telling them something they already believe.  This is good news, the announcement of extraterrestrial le shouldnapost cause mass panic, but maybe it should - as Nick said the society also debated whether a visit from alien le would be a good thing or not. He continued: If we do find extraterrestrial le, and itaposs more than picking up a signal or finding alien microbes, will they be friendly like the lovable alien in ET, or will they be something like the aliens in Independence Day - coming here to exterminate us  Views at the Royal Society were split.

Itaposs too late of course, weaposve been a detectable civilisation for decades as our television and radio signals have leaked out into space - any civilisation capable of threatening us is already aware of us. Nick went on to quote Stephen Hawking, who wasnapost present at the meeting but was a member of the society, as saying: If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didnapost turn out well for the Native Americans.UFO Week on BLAZE commences on Monday, March , until Sunday, April , featuring new UK and Free TV premieres every single night.Indistinguishable From Magic premieres next Friday, April , at .pm on BLAZE, available on Freeview , Freesat , Sky  and Virgin Media .

Carly Bateman, , was frustrated to find one of the tyres of her SUV had been deflated and a passive-aggressive letter had been left on her windscreen, while the vehicle was parked outside her home in Didsbury on March . She was forced to get an Uber to work after finding her Skoda Yeti had been sabotaged, with a group called the Tyre Extinguishers claiming responsibility for the attack on her vehicle. Carly said she would usually get the tram to work, but sometimes needs her car to carry equipment for her entertainment company, which she runs alongside teaching fitness classes.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. The note left on her car branded her aposvainapos and read: We have deflated one or more of your tyres.Youaposll be angry, but donapost take it personally. Itaposs not you, itaposs your car. We did this because driving around urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others. Car companies try to convince us we need massive cars. But SUVs and xs are a disaster for our climate. SUVs are the second-largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade - more than the entire aviation industry. The world is facing a climate emergency. According to the UN, millions of people are already dying from climate change-related causes - drought, hurricanes, floods, forced migration, starvation. So far, the impacts on you have probably been minimal. We need emergency action to reduce emissions immediately. Weaposre taking actions into our own hands because our governments and politicians will not. Evenyou donapost care about the impacts on people far away from you, thereaposs also consequences for your neighbours. SUVs cause more air pollution than smaller cars. SUVs are more likely to kill people than normal cars in collisions.Psychological studies show SUV drivers are more likely to take risks on the road. SUVs are unnecessary, and pure vanity. Thataposs why we have taken this action. You will have no dficulty getting around without your gas guzzler, with walking, cycling or public transport. Tyre Extinguishers defended their actions and bragged that they had disarmed around  SUVs in the UK in the past few weeksapos alone. Speaking after finding the letter, Carly said: Iaposm totally up for saving the planet, I do quite a lot in terms of recycling and getting the tram when I donapost actually need my car. It worries me that I canapost hide it or do anything about it. If it happened another time, it could have been really detrimental to my work.  I hope they donapost do it again. I was worried thatthere was an emergency orit happens to the wrong person, someone disabled, someone going into labour or someone with severe mental health problems, that could really push someone over the edge. They canapost be going around doing that, there are ways to go about things. Iaposm paranoid, all I can do is park on the street because on-street parking is all we have. Thereaposs no way of hiding it or anything so it could happen again. A Skoda Yeti is not even dead flash. They said on the note, aposYouaposve got a x in an urban area purely for vanity, you donapost need itapos. You donapost know what people do for a living, thereaposs no way I would have a big carI didnapost need it andit was for vanity I wouldnapost get a Skoda Yeti, Iaposd get a Range Rover or something.Carly shared a photo of the note and her deflated tyre on her local Facebook group where people shared their anger on her behalf.In the end, she was forced to get a taxi to work, but luckily her dad was able to fix the tyre - which only cost her £. She continued: I came outside ready to leave for work and there was a note on my windscreen and a deflated tyre so I was like what the hell, read it and I was like, aposOkapos so I thought, aposWhat do I do apos. I didnapost have time to get the tram. If I donapost have stuff with me, Iaposll get the tram no problem. We have massive costumes which is why I have a x. It was that or a van. I couldnapost get a lt so I got an Uber and then my dad came out in his van to inflate my tyre sotheir aim is to save the planet, they didnapost solve any problems there because then it involved two vehicles instead of one It was a bit crazy. I was pretty annoyed but Iaposm a aposlet go of what you canapost control and problem solveapos kind of person. I just needed to get to class and I would sort it later. A spokesperson for the Tyre Extinguishers said: We are in a climate emergency. If the drivers of SUVs and xs were a country, it would be the seventh-largest polluting country in the world. As we mention on our website, SUVs are dangerous on roads, they are a climate disaster, and they cause massive air pollution. We are citizens taking action because the government refuses to take action on polluting vehicles. The Tyre Extinguishers is a leaderless movement and every week new people join us. We estimate we have disarmed around  SUVs in the UK in just a few weeks and we have had requests for our leaflet to be translated into French, German, Italian and Spanish. We expect to see this spread and we wonapost stop until itaposs impossible to own a huge, polluting gas-guzzler in the worldaposs urban areas. We want to see bans on SUVs in urban areas, pollution levies to tax SUVs out of existence, and massive investment in free, comprehensive public transport. But until politicians make this a reality, Tyre Extinguishers action will continue.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

Clem Johnson, , first started sharing the pictures of his mumaposs cooking with his mates as a laugh as he found himself constantly being served bizarre dinners such as microwaved bacon, pie with cream crackers, and spaghetti with ketchup. The Liverpool season ticket holder often joked to his pals that some of the meals were unidentiable, and his friends would get involved with the banter, as one even said his dinner looked like it had been cooked in a washing machine. Clemaposs friend Owen Southwood, , was so stunned by the array of strange dishes his mate was eating that he just had to share it with the world - and posted hilarious reviews of the dishes on Twitter.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The thread attracted more than , likes and , retweets, and Owen admitted the pie and crackers dish was among the worst heaposd ever seen. He said: He’s taking the p**s [out of the meals] with most of the pictures. I think he doesn’t mind the spaghetti and sausages but for the rest of them, he’s taking the p**s. We all just send our food in whenever we make something that looks nice, so he does the opposite. It started about two months ago with the sausages and spaghetti. His mum cooks the majority of them. Some of them caused more of a stir in the group than others.  The best-looking one is probably the curry - it looks edible and would probably taste okay. The worst one was the spaghetti with egg and bacon. We voted as a group that it was the worst meal we’d ever seen. The egg and chips weren’t even that bad really - it’s just the presentation. The pie on crackers got called worse than rations. And Clem says he lets his mum cook the dinners as he hates cooking, but he loves seeing the reaction of horried people online. He explained: Iaposve been sending them in for ages as a laugh to see their reaction. I hate cooking it’s just too much effort for five minutes to eat. I live with my mum so she cooks.  Owen said aposenoughaposs enough - it’s going on Twitterapos. All my mates have been laughing for ages. I didn’t think it’d go viral on Twitter though. The reaction onlineaposs been funny. At first, I tried to keep it anonymous but loads of people worked out it was me. I reckon chip and eggs isn’t even that bad. Pie and crackers were definitely a low. I saw that a lad donated £ to a food bank, so that’s all that matters. I don’t go hungry so all good. One of Owenaposs Twitter reviews read: Without doubt the single worst meal I have EVER seen consumed, there are starving refugees who would turn their nose up at this, the bacon was also cooked in the microwave.   While another said: This is supposed to be a fajita, the block of what looks like butter is a solid block of cheese and yes they are baked beans. .  And although Clem is in on the joke, he also took to Twitter to encourage those who laugh at his scran to do what they can to donate to food banks. He tweeted: Now youaposve all had your laugh, can I be serious  Ye my scranaposs s**t, but I’ve got something on my plate. Loads of people don’t.

On the other side of the coin, many modern daters argue that equal rights means itaposs only fair for couples to split the bill, and that it shouldnapost be dictated by gender. One man recently found himself at the centre of such a debate, after a very enjoyable date ended in disaster, when the woman told him she didnapost want to see him again.  At the end of their date, which they had both said they thoroughly enjoyed, the waiter came to their table and askedthey wanted to split the bill, to which he replied: Yes.When I got home, she texted me that she had a good time but she no longer wanted to see me because I am not a gentleman and did not pay for her, he wrote on Reddit.The man explained to his date thathe paid for all his first dates he would be left skint, leaving him questioning what the point would be in spending money on a person who he may not end up dating again.

Another added: Youaposre both allowed to have boundaries and she’s allowed to not want to date or see you again. You guys just weren’t compatible. Move on.

Venting to Reddit, the dog walker said: I was pet sitting and dog walking on my own for seven years - needless to say, I have had a lot of experience with dog owners. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The current client booked me for a one hour walk for once last night and twice today. I walked the dog last night for a little over an hour and got in . miles which was shown on the dogaposs GPS tracker. Several hours later, I received a message saying that the dog needs to be walked  to . miles in an hour. Surprised by this sudden request, the woman searched through their agreement and was unable to find a distance requirement for the job. I am a short person so I have short legs and I am not in shape enough to go that fast, even with incorporating intermittent jogs into the walk, she said. I searched all over the dogaposs profile and this is never mentioned - it just says he needs to be walked for an hour. It is physically impossible for me to get  miles in an hour. Today, I walked the dog again and managed to get  miles in an hour and a half. However, I am only getting paid for an hour, so essentially the owner just got a free  minutes from me.  After dropping the dog off at home, the woman received a condescending message from the owner who claimed her services were not up to scratch. She claims the owner treated her like a child, despite knowing she has almost a decadeaposs worth experience with working with dogs. She added: Several of the messages I have felt have had attitude to them as well. I suggested to the owner that I was going to take the dog on a walk on a nearby trail so we would be away from cars and I felt more comfortable with that and I was completely shot down. Clearly this is not a good of a fit for me and I will be mentioning that after the final walk. I just did not want to leave them to find a new dog walker at the very last minute. The dog is incredibly sweet and I really like him, but the demands and requirements from the owner are just unreasonable for me.Do you think this is a fair demand  Have your say in the comment section below.Unsure how she should handle this situation, the woman has turned to Reddit to ask whether she is overreacting or whether the owneraposs expectations are over the top. One user said: You’re given a time requirement hour, not a distance requirement. This is absurd and that’s awful they are treating you so horribly. I would cut ties with them. It’s not worth it. Another added: This person should be hiring a triathlete to walk their dog -  miles in one hour is a brisk pace for a fit person and  miles is jogging. I have never had a client comment on the distance I walked with their pet. This owner is going to continue to be nothing but trouble. Cut your ties carefully, they may be vengeful and leave a bad review on you. I would use the words, aposnot a good fit based on their needsapos. While a third said: I’m a former cross country runner, and still in good shape. When I’m speed walking, I can approach the  minute a mile mark, but never have reached it. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about, andshe wants someone to run with her dog, then that’s what she should actively seek out. You’re not overreacting.

A unique home with magnicent history has come on the market in the quaint village of Chilcompton, Somerset for £, - but the propertyaposs back garden is an eerie graveyard. The church - which was renovated in the mid s by architect Warwick Rodwell - has been transformed into a light and airy home. Downside Old Church has truly been given a modern make-over and awaits a new family to move in and call it theirs. Originally built in , the property still boasts some of its period features - such as the original church doors and stained glass windows throughout and all the wooden structures.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Andthose features werenapost original enough for you, it even still has all the gravestones from the church situated in the garden. With some of the headstones being over  years old, it is safe to say these gravestones are no longer visited, but they still very much have their place. There are a number of these historic gravestones in which,wanted, visitors would have to submit a written request to the owner of the property to visit them.  The converted church is currently on the market with estate agency Cooper and Tanner. Branch manager Samuel Masters says: The main draw to the house is the how big it really is inside, the garden is a compromise to some, but the other features make it a great home. The strong colours inside and the way it has been well decorated eradicates any cold and spooky feelings of a church and gives a warm and cosy feeling to the home.  The garden wouldnapost suit everyone, but the house itself has a lot of quirky characteristics. So many memories will have happened in this church, weddings, baptisms and also funerals, the home has retained its magnicent history whilst being liveable in a church. The church is located near Bath and Frome, and is only a short distance to Wales.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

Thataposs because, within one hour of the appointment, the -year-old technology graduate noticed her lips had begun to swell rapidly.Kaileeaposs lips ended up ballooning to aposeight timesapos their normal size leaving her looking like a character from Monsters Inc - which she believes is due to an allergic reaction.She says she attempted to calm the swelling with ice, but this only seemed to make things worse.Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.For the next  hours after the appointment, the technology consultant found herself unable to talk or drink normally due to her incredibly sore and swollen apossausage lipsapos. Many of her pals pointed out that the swelling made her look like the character Fungus from the Disney Pixar film, Monsters, Inc. The three-eyed villain is left with giant, red lips after being sucked into a aposscream extractorapos machine. Kailee, from Philadelphia, US, has now shared shocking images of her giant lips to warn people about the risks of allergic reactions to filler. She said: Iaposve always had thinner lips and they disappear when I smile so I wanted to make them fit my face a little bit more. Everything went well at the appointment and the first hour after it started swelling but I think it was just normal because they do swell.  I kept icing them and I think that the ice might have made it worse because then they really started to blow up. Once it hit after an hour or two they were really big and then it was  hours of them being that big. I couldnapost drink anything or even open my mouth to talk - I couldnapost speak. I would say they were eight times the size of my normal lips, it was unreal. I looked like the Monsters, Inc. character. After noticing the swelling, Kailee spoke with her doctor and was prescribed a week-long course of oral steroids to calm the swelling. The doctor also warned her that she was at risk of her throat closing due to the dramatic swelling on her lips, which they worried may travel to her neck. Thankfully the swelling began to subside after three days and the reaction passed without needing further treatment or for the filler to be dissolved. Kailee explained: The pictures donapost even really show how big they were, it was crazy. It was very painful. I was scared it was going to go to my throat, which is what doctors said it could do, and my throat could close basically. That was my biggest fear and then also just thinking aposare they stuck like this apos. They went down after three days and then after that it wasnapost too bad. After posting snaps of her lips online, many people vowed to never get filler after seeing the severe reaction. One commenter said: She looks like the guy out of Monsters, Inc. you know Fungus when he gets sucked [by] the machine. Another said: The scream extractor got another. A third replied: [Oh my god] I thought she glued sausages on her lips as a joke but I guess [theyaposre] real. The technology consultant says that the painful experience initially put her off getting filler again, although she hasnapost ruled it out now that her lips have settled. Kailee added: Once the swelling went down they were completely fine. I definitely am scared of getting them done again but I do like the way they look now, so I donapost knowI will.Do you have a story to share  We pay for stories.

But the words of those who were inside the buildingat the time of this terrorist act says the opposite.Now, dramatic video shows injured civilians covered in dust making their way out of the damaged building after it was bombed. Some can be seen walking down stairs, while others are heard comforting those around them.Rubble is strewn over the floor in a part of the building which is still standing, while the video then pans to a large section of debris just metres away. Russian forces bombed the theatre last week despite a large inscription saying children being clearly visible on the pavement outside. Local officials, citing witness accounts, said on Friday that as many as  people may have been killed in the theatre bombing. The city council made clear it was still not possible to determine the exact death toll after the incident. The Ukrainian government has previously said that it was impossible to tell how many were killed because Mariupol is in chaos and under almost constant bombardment from besieging Russian forces. Russia has denied bombing the theatre. The Kremlin says Russian forces have not targeted civilians after invading Ukraine on Feb. . Ukrainian officials have said that about  people were rescued from the rubble and that the theatre basement, where local officials said many people were sheltering at the time of the bombardment, had withstood the attack.Ukraine officials believe more than , people have died in the Mariupol siege and those remaining are starving and suffering a lack of water. And there is increasing alarm over the fate of those locals who manage to escape the hell of Mariupol. The city council revealed Russian troops are kidnapping civilians, possibly as many as , so far, and processing them into Russia, confiscating their passports.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the siege on Mariupol was a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come. Professor Mark Galeotti, principal director of Mayak Intelligence, said Mariupol has been comprehensively trashed by the bombardment, but civilian casualties will continue to rise in coming days.In the grand scheme of things the Russians arenapost in a position to escalate, but the point is that theyaposve chosen Mariupol as a key target, he said. Mariupol has become a symbolic site of resistance and one way or another they will make sure that they take it. He continued: For Putin every extra city he can take is an extra bargaining chip. He said that with the city completely cut off, every Ukrainian troop killed would be one less enemy to fight, as reinforcements are unable to reach Mariupol.

A bit like those two Russians who rang ministers Ben Wallace, Priti Patel and Nadine Dorries. But the Putin stooges met their match. I hear after a minute of listening to Dorries they hung up thinking they were being hoaxed by someone pretending to be an MP. It makes you proud to be British. It also makes you wonder how anyone believes they could hoax members of a government told to bluff whenever their mouth opens, as witnessed in the Chancellor’s Spring Budget statement which felt more like The Great British Cock ’n’ Bull Swindle.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment sectionHere was Rishi Sunak claiming we’re ALL about to feel the pinch when as a multi-millionaire married to a billionaire, he clearly isn’t. He said he was putting “billions back into the pockets of people” when he’s making us pay the highest tax rates since  while suffering the biggest cost-of- living crisis since rationing in the early s. A fact confirmed when ­economists calculated a worker on the average annual wage of £, will be £ worse off. Pure bull, and he knows it. The decision to let energy firms escape a windfall tax on their gargantuan profits was a cruel and calculated decision by this Tory government to force low income households to choose between food and heat. Yet still they lie about levelling up being their top priority.With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year.Their latest con is to claim our current problems are all down to Ukraine, when in reality, the economy was sliding down the pan way before the invasion due to their incompetence and nepotism. Their latest slogan is “our work begins now” which makes it sound like Labour has just left office after saddling the country with a crippling debt, when Gordon Brown moved out  years ago. They tell us they detest how obscenely PO has treated its workers, yet they voted against scrapping Fire and Rehire and signed off the legislation that allowed the Dubai-owned firm to sack  employees over Zoom.  They tell us they’ve done more for refugees than any other country, then make it a criminal offence for desperate Ukrainian families to arrive in the UK without the right papers. Like David Cameron posting photos of himself volunteering at a foodbank, to make it look like poverty is close to his heart, when foodbank use went up ,% during his time as PM. There seems no limit to their capacity to insult our intelligence. A telling video emerged on Thursday of the NATO meeting in Brussels. As world leaders warmly greeted each other, Boris Johnson stood unloved and alone, like Billy No-Mates. Further proof that the world’s politicians have discovered through painful experience that the oligarch-enabler and his ministers are just two-bit hustlers. Which is why they choose to give the British the cold shoulder. My grandad used to have a saying about people he found shady: “They’re kidding the goolies off you.” Labour should adopt that slogan for the May elections, because the overtaxed penny is surely now dropping with even the most gullible about how badly they’ve been conned.What do you think  Write to yourvoice@mirror Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Russia Ukraine warPoliticsTory GovernmentSpring StatementRishi SunakLevelling Up WatchThe economyCost of Living: Were Here to HelpEconomic crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The young girl was a rhythmic gymnast, the sport in which Vladimir Putin ’s supposed partner Alina Kabaeva won an Olympic gold medal and countless other honours.“She was supposed to conquer the world, but died buried in rubble, Katerynaaposs coach said. “Can there be any justication of that  Look at this talented girl. She was supposed to give her smiles to the world.  “What are children guilty of  I believe that there is a space in hell for everyone who is involved - and as soon as possible.” She added: “I cannot speak, maybe when I come back to my senses.” Kateryna’s mother Marina Diachenko has not spoken about her loss, while reports say her son Artyom, Kateryna’s younger brother, is a talented kickboxer.Kabaeva - who plays a major role training young gymnasts in Russia - has not commented on Katerynaaposs death even though condolences have come in from around the world.Bulgarian gymnast Iliana Raeva said: “I can’t believe we live in such a cruel world.  The Swiss federation said she was one of many victims of a senseless war”. In her only comment on the war, Kabaeva castigated the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics. “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. A petition has been started to demand she is thrown out of Switzerland where reports suggested she was hiding during the war with children she supposedly shares with Putin. “It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says the incendiary petition. Another report indicated she had retreated to a hi-tech underground city in Siberia.It comes after it was confirmed on Friday morning that at least  people taking shelter at a theatre in Mariupol were killed by a Russian airstrike. The Drama Theatre of Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by the deadly airstrike last Wednesday.Elsewhere, Ukrainian troops launched a series of counter-attacks overnight which forced back over-stretched and under-supplied Russian troops, just outside the capital of Kyiv. Kyiv’s troops had managed to not only push back the Russian invaders, but reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to  miles east of the city that has long been Russia ’s main target.

Not long after the invasion of Ukraine, Putin ordered his nuclear deterrent forces on alert he sent several Russian submarines capable of carrying  ballistic missiles each sailed into the North Atlantic, it has emerged. At the time, nuclear experts told The Mirror that this was posturing rather than a real nuclear threat. It has now been reported they ed to Russia shortly afterwards, however western intelligence is now keeping a closer eye on Putinaposs nuclear arsenal. Putin has the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world with , - thousands are thought to be classed as tactful - meaning they are intended to eliminate enemy targets in a specic area without causing widespread destruction. A navy source told The Times: The majority of Russian conventional weapons can be retrofitted with a low-yield nuclear capability. It is more complex than ‘plug and play’ but the Russians are quite innovative in what they put in front of bombs and missiles. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Putinaposs justication for invading Ukraine was to de-Nazy the country, not destroy it as experts say they donapost see evidence that the Kremlin is gearing up to launch nuclear weapons. A western official said that there had been no sign in the conflict so far of any nuclear warheads being loaded onto missiles bound for Ukraine. At the time Putin put his nuclear forces on special alert, Dr Matthew Kroenig, Director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told Thethere were two reasons to move his weapons.  He said it so Putin would be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack with the weapons being in one place and to move them into strategic places where they can be launched from. He said: This is part of Russian strategy. I donapost think we are getting ready for a nuclear war. Itaposs like in the animal kingdom when animals make themselves look really big before a fight. What Putin is trying to do is intimidate us to say aposstay out of Ukraineapos. Dr Kroenig said that Putin used a similar strategy in  during the annexation of Crimea. He added: This development does make things more dangerous with nukes moving around, but Russia did this in  and they use nuclear deterrence as an offensive strategy.

The despotic leader ordered his seemingly unwilling military over the border of neighbouring Ukraine on February , in an invasion styled on some of the history booksapos grisliest pages.Thousands have died, sending the world into a mixture of shock, anger and despair. Around the world financial markets are faltering while in Russia the general population has been forced into queuing for essentials. Russian protestors have been arrested in droves, with acts of dissent common despite swt arrests seeing thousands whisked away to jail cells. In an effort to stir up national support, Putin organised a ‘pro-Russia rally’ in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on March . Despite claims of attendees numbering in their hundreds of thousands, reports have since surfaced that people were forced to attend by their employers - calling in to question the Russian populationaposs appetite for war.With pressure mounting beyond his borders and dissent re at home, the end of Putin’s time at the top of Russian politics could be coming to an end - but who might replace him  Who could replace Vladimir Putin as Russian president Putin rose to power in . As a former KGB chief he has ruled with a vice-like grip over Russia for  years under the titles of president and prime minister. He has given political opponents little opportunity and is allegedly behind plots to assassinate rivals and rig elections.Because of this, his successor is someone likely to be close to him and share in his vision. Mikhail Mishustin  Wwere Putin to step down or be deposed, Mikhail Mishustin would be the man to fill the power vacuum immediately. He is the prime minister of Russia and is effectively the second in command. He chairs the Russian Federation’s central government and previously served as the countyaposs director of the taxation service. He has held the countryaposs second top job since . Sergei Sobyanin Sergei Sobyanin is the mayor of Moscow and an affiliate of Putin. He is, however, not thought to be in the -year-old’s inner circle, yet has demonstrated traits and approaches to ruling much like Putin. A fan of a crackdown on protestors, he has been liberal with his deployment of Moscow’s police to break up dissent.He also, like Putin, has made efforts to reduce LGBT freedoms in Russia, having banned pride parades in the city. Sergei Shoigu  Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu has been a coordinator in the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The Russian military is thought to largely follow his orders, although he himself takes his orders from Putin. He is a member of the dictator’s inner circle, and so it would be a shock for him to use his control of the military to stage a coup to overthrow his boss. Nikolai Patrushev  Since , Patrushev has been at the helm of Russia’s security council - a crucial wing of the Russian government, he has control over the FSB .The -year-old is likely to have approved the fatal poisoning of FSB whistleblower Alexander Litvinenko, a UK public enquiry published in  found.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoEuropean UnionNikolai PatrushevSergei SobyaninAlexander LitvinenkoSergei ShoiguVladimir PutinRussia Ukraine warRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"craignish boat jumble sails back","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

NowA TV series will feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model – all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback, we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils u13s in football action","story":"Campbeltown Pupils stravelled to Clydebank to play BSC Glasgowon Sunday March , looking to follow-up on their draw with Busby the previous week.After a promising start, the Pupils found themselves - down at half-time, through a combination of poor defending, and also some good play from the BSC attackers.The young Campbeltown team rallied in the second half, and with a much better all-round performance, capped off with goals from Ryan Johnston and Ben Cunningham.Finnart #s The young Pupils# second away game in a row saw them travel on Sunday to play league leaders Finnart.The first  minutes saw the Pupils put in one of their best performances of the season, competing in every position, and they were rewarded midway through the half with a brilliant -yard strike from Ryan Johnston that found the top corner.The pace and strength of the league leaders# attackers started to cause problems, however, and two quick-fire goals gave Finnart the lead.The crucial goal came with the last kick of the half, with slack defending from the Pupils allowing Finnart to go into the break - ahead.The second half was a very even affair.

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park.

Lloyds banks and  Halax branches are also set to close across the UK. The branches are thought to employ  people, but Lloyds said it would try to find affected staff new roles within the company.Caren Evans, national officer for the union Unite, said: “Lloyds Banking Group must not be allowed to abandon  more local communities where bank branches play an essential role.“The  employees who work tirelessly in their communities are dedicated to serving the banking needs of the most vulnerable who depend on their skilled services.“When a bank branch closes, the heart of the local community is ripped out and the results are devastating.

That ideological dream was never going to be realised due to the fact that engineers may be capable of looking  years ahead, but investors look for much faster s and politicians only look as far as the next election. The result has been  years during which there has been no national energy plan.Recent events have brought this situation into sharp focus and to kick-start some strategic thinking in Scotland I would make an urgent plea for the SNP Government to realise that its perfectly reasonable opposition to nuclear weapons does not need to be accompanied by stubborn opposition to nuclear generation of electricity.

I wonderthe research breaks down whether such uninformed tenants are all from the pre-December  era, before the Scottish Government’s Private Residential Tenancy Agreementswere introduced. Surely they could not be from the current PRTA era given the wealth of information with which they are deluged before a new tenancy is set up.A typical PRTA extends to some  pages, with a couple of helpful introductory pages entitled \"Know your rights\", followed by a useful index to the PRTA’s three sections, Section  being an essential Glossary of Terms and Interpretation without which the hapless parties to the agreement will not be able to understand the  clauses which comprise Section . Wading through all that eventually brings the weary parties to about page , the remaining -odd pages comprising “Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement”, the Easy Read Notes being so easy to read that they also start with a definition of \"Agreement\" to mean \"the tenancy agreement for the property which is being leased\".The tenant must of course be given a full copy of the PRTA in prescribed form, with all its attendant notes, so one wonders why any tenant in the PRTA era could possibly be unaware of their rights. Could it just be that swamping a tenant with such information overload is a sure-fire way to guarantee that only the most diligent prospective tenant with a penchant for perusing y legal documents will ever actually read the stuff  Sometimes less is indeed more.Campbell Fullarton, Kilmarnock.MYRA AND ME  PERISH THE THOUGHTDOUG Marrsays that his last passport photo \"bore a startling resemblance to a th century serial killer\".

And dferent messaging services or social media s will be required to work together.The new rules underscore how Europe has become a global pacesetter in efforts to curb the power of tech companies through anti-trust investigations, stringent regulations on data privacy and proposed rules for areas like articial intelligence.\"What we have been deciding about yesterday will start a new era in tech regulation,\" European Union lawmaker Andreas Schwab said at a press conference on Friday.The European Consumer Organisation, or BEUC, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help consumers by creating fairer and more competitive digital markets.Tech companies were less enthusiastic.Apple said it was concerned that parts of the Digital Markets Act \"will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal\".Google said it will study the text and work with regulators to implement it.\"While we support many of the DMAs ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we remain concerned that some of the rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans,\" the company said.Amazon said it is reviewing what the rules mean for its customers. Facebook did not reply to a request for comment.The Digital Markets Act includes a number of eye-catching measures that could shake up the way big tech companies operate.Companies would not be allowed to rank their own products or services higher than those of others in online search results or reuse data collected from dferent services.A users personal data cannot be combined for targeted ads unless \"explicit consent\" is given.Messaging services and social media s must work with each other to avoid the domination of a few companies that have already established big networks of users.That opens up the possibility, for example, of Telegram or Signal users being able to exchange messages with WhatsApp users.Criteria for defining a gatekeeper have been tweaked to include companies that earn at least . billion euros in annual revenue in Europe in the past three years, have a market value of  billion euros, provide services in at least three EU countries, and have  million users and , business users each year in the bloc.Violations could be punished with whopping fines - up to % of a companys annual income. For a repeat offence, a fine of up to % of its worldwide turnover may be imposed. That could work out to billions of dollars for wealthy Silicon Valley companies.Negotiators from the European Parliament and the Council, which represents the  EU member countries, reached the deal after months of talks.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

Branches will remain vital in meeting customers’ needs but we must continually review our network to make sure we have branches in locations where customers need and use them the most.#As a result, we#ve made the dficult decision to close this branch because customers are using it less often. In addition the majority of customers are also using alternative ways to bank.#Explaining what the closure will mean for Bank of Scotland customers signed up to the Stromness branch, the bank adds: #You can use any of our branches and our nearest alternative is the Kirkwall branch.#You can also use a Post Office for your everyday banking.#We’re still here to support you, and there’s a number of ways you can bank with us.

That switch brings with it all manner of challenges and has led to the international calendar being altered dramatically. This camp is the first of just three that England will have before the tournament gets under way, with this month’s friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast followed by four Nations League matches in June. Southgate’s side finish the group with a double-header in September – the only meet-up of what is usually an autumn schedule comprised of three camps. With so few chances to be with the squad, England need to make the most of this opportunity.“It is important to try dferent formations and tactics,” Southgate said when unveiling his squad last Thursday. “We can use these games to try to understand how we approach the World Cup.” The England boss has tinkered with his tournament approaches depending on the strengths of his squad, with a three-man backline providing the  for their run to the  World Cup semi-finals. Southgate switched to a four-man defence as the Three Lions finished third in the inaugural Nations League finals the following year and used that for the most part of the rearranged Euros. England moved to a back three for the last- clash with Germany and final against Italy, ing to that base in November qualiers.Three defenders are vying to make their bow on Saturday. England Under-s captain Marc Guehi’s fine performances with Crystal Palace led to his call-up for this month’s double-header, with club team-mate Tyrick Mitchell joining him after some withdrawals at the start of the week. Southampton full-back Kyle Walker-Peters was also brought in on Monday as Southgate experiments in the absence of high-profile absentees. The England manager confirmed the trio will feature at some point over the coming days. vw,vw,px, px\"Jordan Pickford faces a fight to keep the England goalkeeping jersey Aaron Ramsdale has enjoyed a superb season with Arsenal and was set to win his second cap this month, having made his debut in November’s - cakewalk against San Marino. The -year-old was emerging as the biggest threat to number one Jordan Pickford but a hip injury has laid him low, meaning the other options are Nick Pope and Fraser Forster – the man brought into replace Ramsdale’s replacement Sam Johnstone. vw,vw,px, px\"Harry Kane is closing in on Wayne Rooney’s goalscoring record It is a matter of when rather thanEngland captain Harry Kane surpassed Wayne Rooney as the national team’s all-time top scorer. The -year-old is just five shy of the former Manchester United striker’s -goal haul and will go level in second with former record holder Sir Bobby Charlton when he next finds the net. “That record is there, it is close,” Kane said this week. “I’d love to break it and hopefully with the games we have this year, that’ll be possible.” How much Southgate decides to utilise his skipper in these friendlies will influence how much the striker chips away at Rooney’s record tally."},{"url":null,"title":"good-performances-goal-gareth-southgate-england-build-world-cup  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

I think easily underestimated.“I think qualying always isanyway, so I suspect looking at the results and the performances the way they went…Italy were in that position.“But also there were fine margins in three or four of their games and that’s football.”Italy finished runners-up in qualying Group B to Switzerland, who sit th in the FIFA world rankings and should provide a good test for absentee-hit England. vw,vw,px, px\"Bukayo Saka has pulled out of the England squad because of Covid- Bukayo Saka became the sixth withdrawal of this camp having tested positive for Covid-, while Arsenal team-mate Emile Smith Rowe looks set to sit out against the Swiss.“Emile didn’t train today so I would thinkunlikely he’ll be involved tomorrow,” Southgate said.“It’s nothing too serious but we’ll check to see whether he can be involved tomorrow. Raheemis absolutely fine.“It was a shame to lose Bukayo but we’re back in those moments with Covid where there is a spike in the country – and we’ve had the same.”Askedplayers were waiting for results to come back following Saka’s positive test, Southgate said: “No, I am lost on the rules, really, so I can’t sit and give you a medical download of all of that. vw,vw,px, px\"Tyrick Mitchell is set for his England debut ”I’m not sure why he is out because I think you can carry on now with normal le but also I think people have an ethical responsibilitythey’re positive to stay away from others and stop the spread of the virus.“I think by the normal rules of le he could carry on, but the football rules are a bit dferent. I am in a maze of confusion, frankly.”In terms of available players, Southgate confirmed uncapped Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell and Kyle Walker-Peters will make their England debuts over the coming days.“Definitely we’re going to have debuts this week, for sure, whether that’s tomorrow or Tuesday,” he said.“So great moments for those players and we will always want to put them in with experienced players as well, so we’ve got good balance and it gives them the best chance of succeeding.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gareth-bale-claims-media-criticism-send-athletes-over-edge  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648210667218.jpg--recommendation_for_post_primary_pupils_to_wear_facemasks_to_be_scrapped_after_easter.jpg?1648210667000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220325newsrecommendation for post primary pupils to wear facemasks to be scrapped after easter","story":"It will no longer be recommended that post-primary pupils wear a face covering in corridors or confined communal areas following the Easter break.

Credit: Colm O’ReillyEdwin Poots. Credit: Brian Lawless FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCase: Dr Tamara Bronckaers. Credit: Colm O’ReillySam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAfter being asked five times for a copy of a civil servant’s register of interests, a Stormont department has refused to allow the public to see it — claiming that it cannot release the information because of a court case.Six months ago, an employment tribunal unanimously found that Tamara Bronckaers, a senior vet at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswith an “exemplary performance and record”, had been treated appallingly and effectively sacked because she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering.Despite the Executive’s repeated pledges of transparency, the department has been unusually reluctant to respond to requests for even basic details in relation to the case. DAERA is now using taxpayers’ money to attempt to overturn the devastating employment tribunal judgment that raised serious concerns about Northern Ireland’s chief vet and one of his deputies — but is refusing to say whether that was approved by the department’s minister, Edwin Poots.Unless the department succeeds in persuading the Court of Appeal to overturn the ruling, the public could be forced to pay £m to compensate Dr Bronckaers, along with huge legal bills.In a ,-word judgment, Employment Judge Ó Murray repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues — line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey.At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to pursue enforcement action against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals and animal movements being electronically deleted from DAERA’s much-vaunted computer system meant to track all livestock moves to ensure traceability of meat.Dr Huey told her he knew the manager of the market personally and also knew its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the end of January, the Belfastasked DAERA for a copy of Dr Huey and Dr Henderson’s declaration of interests. After multiple requests, the department eventually replied to say that because Dr Huey is a member of the departmental board his declarations were available at a page on its website.However, it did not respond in relation to Dr Henderson, a grade five senior principal veterinary officer who — according to the judgment — was heavily involved in undermining Dr Bronckaers after she attempted to enforce the law.After five requests, the department eventually responded to say: “As this is a court matter, the department will not be commenting any further.”The tribunal found as a matter of fact that Dr Huey knew the manager of Ballymena Livestock Market “personally” and that “he knew the owner of the market who was chairman of the Markets Association”. The tribunal found that Dr Huey acted in a way which discouraged Dr Bronckaers from enforcing the law against Ballymena Livestock Market.Whilst there is no suggestion that there is was any formal connection between Dr Huey and Mr Henderson and Ballymena Livestock Market, it is unclear from the judgment what Dr Huey meant when he told the tribunal that he knew the manager “personally”.There is no reference to anyone at Ballymena Livestock Market in Dr Huey’s register of interests. When asked about that, the department said: “As this is a court matter, the department will not be commenting any further.”Related topicsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - The Executive OfficeEdwin PootsMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Stormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesPlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itIFEX: , people due to attend hospitality event PremiumNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’North Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI ProtocolLong-term future of HMS Caroline in Belfast secured – ministerRestaurant review: Fingers crossed a whole lotta love is shown for new east Belfast spot LottieMinister confident obstacles to NI involvement in Euro  bid can be overcomeDeclan BogueOpinionBattle to avoid drop from Division One brings the real excitementLatestNews Of The World publisher loses bid to end phone hacking litigationGareth Bale claims media criticism could send some athletes ‘over the edge’Gareth Southgate questions what a World Cup boycott would achieve for EnglandHalf a million new Covid- infections a day in UK, figures suggestLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI Protocol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Zivica KerkezLisa SmythTwitterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s Children’s Commissioner has said she believes some primary schools are too afraid to promote the Covid- vaccine to parents.Koulla Yiasouma said she is aware of cases where staff in secondary schools endured “awful intimidation and harassment” after students were given information on the Covid- vaccine.As a result, Ms Yiasouma, who has herself received abuse for her comments on teenagers receiving the vaccine, said she does not blame any schools that do not want to become involved vaccination programme.And she also said she does not envy parents who are trying to decide whether to vaccinate their young children against the virus.It comes after it emerged that less than % of children aged between five and  in Northern Ireland have received a Covid- vaccine.In December, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrecommended that the vaccine be offered to five to -year-olds deemed at particular risk from the virus and those who live with someone who is immunocompromised.Then, in February, it recommended that the programme could be extended to all children in the age group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, only , doses of the vaccine have been administered to children between the ages of five and .Ms Yiasouma said: “I think there are a number of issues at play here and I’m not sure safety is the biggest concern.“The Public Health Agencyhas put quite a lot of information on the safety of the vaccines on its website, but I think it would be betterit was being made more available to parents.“There are questions over the benefits of the vaccine to children and parents might not see the point in going to the trouble of finding out more.“It’s not even as though the vaccine is being administered in the school setting, parents have to go and make an appointment themselves, yet they aren’t clear about the benefits of the vaccine.“What I’m also hearing from parents is that they aren’t sure about giving the vaccine to their child simply for the benefit of the community.“We are seeing children getting it where there is a vulnerable family member but where that isn’t the case, there is more hesitancy from parents.“I don’t envy parents having to make the decision and I wouldn’t say they should or shouldn’t.“What I would advise is that they read up all the information from the PHA and make their own decision.”The Department of Health has acknowledged the low uptake in children between the ages of five and  and said the PHA has been working with a range of organisations to increase the number of doses administered in the age group.These include the health trusts and Education Authority, however, Ms Yiasouma said schools are reticent to become involved in the delivery of the programme. She explained: “I spoke to secondary schools where staff were threatened, there was awful intimidation and harassment, which I think has made primary schools very, very reluctant to be seen promoting the vaccine.”Ms Yiasouma also said there is a perception that a younger child having to isolate after testing positive and missing a week of school is not as harmful as when it happens to teenagers preparing for exams.However, she warned that children in primary one and two have suffered substantial harm as a result of the pandemic.“They have missed out on the preparation to ensure they are ready for school and we’re seeing them coming in and they don’t have the language skills or other skills required,” she continued.“Aside from children with special educational needs, who suffered the most harm throughout the pandemic, it is those children at the start of the school career that we’re most worried about.”Rachel Spiers, Immunisation and Vaccination Programme Manager at the PHA, on Thursday night said vaccination remains “one of the most important things” parents can do to protect children against ill-health.“Evenyour child has already had Covid-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease, as we have seen that it can be possible to develop Covid- more than once,” she explained.While most children aged five to  will have mild diseasethey contract Covid-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days.“Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group,” said Ms Spiers“It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. “When you look at the risk of Covid- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthMore On Department of Health‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedUkraine President Zelensky accepts invitation to address Irish ParliamentFresh calls for urgent increase in mileage expenses for domiciliary health workersCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and , new cases recordedAdoption Bill which puts children at centre of decision-making reaches ‘signicant’ milestoneMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’North Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI ProtocolLong-term future of HMS Caroline in Belfast secured – ministerRestaurant review: Fingers crossed a whole lotta love is shown for new east Belfast spot LottieMinister confident obstacles to NI involvement in Euro  bid can be overcomeDeclan BogueOpinionBattle to avoid drop from Division One brings the real excitementLatestDerby administrators hopeful of naming preferred bidder early next weekAllison MorrisOpinionProxy bomb a declaration of all-out war against NI ProtocolTony Holohan to step down as Chief Medical OfficerFTSE closes up as oil and mining firms remain strong due to Ukraine warRussia accused of war crimes after Mariupol theatre death toll put at ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PresseyeGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Department for Infrastructurehas been strongly criticised for building a second park-and-ride facility on the outskirts of Londonderry in breach of planning conditions.The River Faughan Anglersgroup spoke out after Stormont’s Public AccountsCommittee said in a scathing report that it was “alarmed and appalled” at the abysmal performance of, and lack of transparency in, the planning system.In August , the DfI park-and-ride facility beside the A bridge over the River Faughan was damaged by flooding. Cars were swept into the river and people were rescued from the rising waters.It was then discovered it was operating without planning permission or environmental assessments.Read MoreWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Council rapped for spending £k on ‘fancy cameras’ for zoom meetingsThis was because what permission it had was temporary, and a condition required the facility’s removal and the restoration of the site by , a full year before the flooding struck. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In effect, DfI was breaching its planning permission.While the site is no longer operational, RFA said the department is still in breach because the facility was meant to be removed and the site restored by .In , DfI submitted an application for a new park-and-ride facility that opened on the edge of Drumahoe in August last year.RFA believes this facility should be rendered “unauthorised” because it is in breach of a planning condition which required it to submit additional environmental information to the planning authority and to have this agreed before any works commenced.RFA director Dean Blackwood said the department charged with upholding the integrity and credibility of the planning system continued to demonstrate why citizens had absolutely no trust in its ability to do so.“Expert consultees such as the Northern Ireland Environment Agencyand Shared Environmental Services, whose input into environmental planning matters is essential, both declined to provide that input because of the department’s unauthorised actions, which rendered the planning condition meaningless and ineffective,” he added.“While the department might seek to play down its unauthorised actions by claiming its dedicated environmental team was on site and did not raise any concern, that is contradicted by the fact that during construction works, RFA filmed an pollution incident on the Faughan on August , , coming from works associated with the park-and-ride.”Mr Blackwood also claimed it had proved dficult to get answers or an acknowledgement of mistakes. “That it took nine Assembly questions from Rachel Woods MLA, tabled over a period of more than a year, to elicit an admission from the minister that her department did, in fact, start work in breach of its planning condition, suggests to me that the public service principles of openness and transparency hold little value in this department,” he said.The DfI accepted it had powers and s that enabled it to monitor the operation of planning matters and to oversee and secure the implementation of regional policy and good practices.However, it claimed that the responsibility to do so ultimately rested with councils, and it did not want to interfere.Compliance with any planning application is the responsibility of the relevant council, the DfI also claimed.A spokesperson said the department did not take a decision to “intentionally commence works” before the required environmental information was agreed by the council.“The facility has been operational since July . In addition, the NIEA, along with the department’s consulting advisors and dedicated environmental team, were on site extensively during construction,” they added. “During this period, they did not raise any concern or issues relating to either the environmental controls or working methods adopted.”The local council confirmed it was aware of an alleged breach of conditions. A spokeswoman said: “A report of an alleged pollution incident was received. The council engaged with the DfI, the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and NIEA officials on the matter.”Related topicsDepartment for InfrastructureNorthern Ireland AssemblyRachel WoodsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - More On Department for InfrastructurePlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’ in Northern IrelandBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayNorthern Ireland taxi journeys set for further increase following last year’s .% rise in maximum faresCareless driving set to become £ fixed penalty notice offence in Northern IrelandMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’North Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI ProtocolLong-term future of HMS Caroline in Belfast secured – ministerRestaurant review: Fingers crossed a whole lotta love is shown for new east Belfast spot LottieMinister confident obstacles to NI involvement in Euro  bid can be overcomeDeclan BogueOpinionBattle to avoid drop from Division One brings the real excitementLatestGareth Southgate questions what a World Cup boycott would achieve for EnglandHalf a million new Covid- infections a day in UK, figures suggestLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI ProtocolMother and ex-partner jailed for killing two-year-old after weeks of abuseLong-term future of HMS Caroline in Belfast secured – minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are a number of slogans.Anyone who has been following the frantic goings-on in the Assembly can only assume our MLAs have finally heard them. Either that or there’s an election coming up. You decide.Then again, considering what’s being done today, could it not have been done yesterday Looking at the raft of bills flowing through the chamber these past few weeks, particularly related to education, perhaps MLAs have adopted the trait of the typical student. Last-minute cramming ahead of the summer exams.With the Assembly about to wrap up its current mandate, and elections due on May , a new to-do list will emerge. Whether a great big tick can be placed beside what needs to be done, depending on whether an Executive can get up and running, is unknown, butpast experience is anything to go by, in five years there’ll be another rush of last-minute legislation.There was a to-do list five years ago. Yes, Covid will have curtailed progress on some major issues, but the reality is that MLAs have had five years of scratching their Private Members# Bills.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up You do wonder where the urgency was in . Did the itching start so suddenly at the beginning of  Instead, there has been an extensive list of bills being rushed through, some under accelerated passage which, of course, would not have been needed had the process started earlier in the mandate. And rushed legislation isn’t always for the best. Some things need y consideration.Perhaps the biggest, and certainly the most contested, was the Integrated Education Bill from Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, which took six years of work to get to the Assembly.But in the last few weeks there has been the Flexible School Starting Age Bill, a bill to introduce CPR training as a formal part of the NI curriculum which was finally adopted as a ministerial directive, a bill on providing period products, a bill on removing the teacher exemption from fair employment legislation, and a bill to grant the Education Minister powers to dissolve the dysal General Teaching Council. That’s just within one department.And you could say, as MLAs reach the end of their five-year stint at Stormont, it’s election rush hour.In the space of a few hours, legislation on the free availability of period products, hospital car parking charges, domestic abuse safe leave from employment, the preservation of documents relating to historical institutions, safe access zones for abortion services and the fair employment of teachers were all speeding past in a blur.Sighs of relief for those who have worked to get their bills through for Royal Ascent, but maybe they made things a little harder for themselves than they needed to. Every Assembly mandate starts with the best intentions. The next one will be no dferent.While we should at least be grateful that important decisions are being made, it does all arrive with a little regret that the achievements were not being celebrated by cheering MLAs some time ago.Perhaps we should have elections more oftenwe want to get things done  Now there’s a worrying thought, but it is amazing what can be achieved when the spirit moves you.As elected MLAs reassemble, in whatever form of government the election brings come May, it would be refreshing to see the enthusiasm and the urgency to actually get things done that have been a hallmark of the final days of the current crop, bear fruit in the early days of a new administration.Last-minute winners can be more enjoyable and they do say all good things come to those who wait, but there are vital things Northern Ireland simply shouldn’t have to wait for.Related topicsMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongMore On Michelle McIlveenPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Education Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealed£m for new school buildings plannedMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’North Belfast security alert: Watch moment Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney evacuated after vehicle hijackedTop VideosPlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north BelfastPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest PoliticsStormont’s inertia over refugees ‘puts them at risk of exploitation and abuse’Loyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisNorthern Ireland set for #problems and confusion# over a clash between UK and EU law, Government admits‘These people have no idea what struggling families are going through’: Northern Ireland mum hits out at Chancellor’s Spring statementLatestGareth Southgate questions what a World Cup boycott would achieve for EnglandHalf a million new Covid- infections a day in UK, figures suggestLoyalist paramilitaries believed to be behind north Belfast security alert: Bomb attack designed to send ‘strong message’ to Irish government over NI ProtocolMother and ex-partner jailed for killing two-year-old after weeks of abuseLong-term future of HMS Caroline in Belfast secured – minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but

It is too early to say how he is responding, however we are hopeful that this is going to be a game changer in his recovery.ldquoAlan still has a long road ahead, but he is buoyed by the support from back home and has asked me to pass on his heartfelt thanks along with our own.Mrs McDonald said that aside from organising the funding appeal, her family felt helpless with her son being so far from home and family members not able to visit him.ldquoIt has been another tough week for Alan, as the medical team in Christchurch worked tirelessly to keep him stable with a series of procedures, including plasma exchange as well as regular dialysis. The treatment so far has already taken a toll on his body and, in Alanrsquos case, it is not having the outcome the medics had hoped for, she said.ldquoWersquove found it really dficult watching Alan go through all of this and not being able to be with him.ldquoThe distance between us back home and him in New Zealand feels even greater and we are desperate to see him again.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

While devastated with the news, Paulrsquos we, Emma, said he was determined to beat the disease but only she knew that his condition was terminal.She spoke of his final moments and how his thoughts where of her and his daughters mdash Eimear, Rachel and Evie-Grace.ldquoHe asked me not to let the three girls forget him and he told me how much he loved me.

He got his chance to DJ on his own for the first time due to a double booking.He then began to DJ regularly at the Central Park nightclub in his early s, later securing a residency in The Groovy Train at the M Club in Belfast in .Paulrsquos break into radio came in  when he became a presenter with FM in Newry, part of the Q Radio Network, later becoming a breakfast presenter and eventually operations manager.He left in  and worked freelance for three years with Downtown Radio before joining U presenting the Sunday afternoon show in .In , he took on the overnight programme from midnight until am, Monday to Thursday.Paul also was a multi-award winning wedding DJ and played regularly as the recommended DJ for the Hastings Hotel Group.OrsquoHares in Newcastle paid its condolences on social media to Paulrsquos family and friends:: lsquoDJ PK was a resident here for many years and was heavily involved in the success of Central Park and Coast nightclub entertaining generations of party goers here.rsquoAfter a service at Our Lady Of The Assumption Church in Newcastle, Paulrsquos remains left for cremation in Dardistown Crematorium in Dublin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Washed up munitions a reminder of Murlough’s military history  ","story":"THE news of a controlled explosion on Murlough beach last Thursday might sound shocking.But it isnrsquot the first time that Army bomb disposal experts have detonated a suspected WWII mortar found in County Downrsquos sands.Such ordnance washes up relatively frequently, assumed to have escaped the Beaufort Dyke trench in the Irish Sea, where massive amounts of munitions were dumped after the war mdash including  tons of four-inch mortars.But stray munitions have also been found before in Murloughrsquos sand dunes, reflecting the arearsquos rich wartime history.In fact, Murlough Nature Reserve mdash formerly known as the Dundrum Sandhills mdash has interesting history that extends far beyond WWII.The name itself comes from the old Irish word lsquoMuirbolcrsquo, meaning lsquosea-bagrsquo , and evidence of human activity in the -acre reserve extends back to around  BC.Archaeological digs in the s unearthed multiple signs of burning, hundreds of pottery shards, worked flints and even carbonised hazelnut shells that confirm Neolithic and Bronze Age activity.Much later, Murloughrsquos dunes were important for the Normans. They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Welcoming the emergence of such an image, Mr Allister said: “Why a portrait of the man who allegedly ordered the murder, Michael Collins, is just round the corner from where Sir Henry Wilson’s now hangs is less easy to determine.” That is to put it mildly. It is entirely wrong that there is painting of Collins on display or one of Eamon de Valera. These are men who wanted to destroy the very concept of a Northern Ireland. Mr de Valera continued after NI was agreed to try to shatter the deal that had led to partition.Many people will defend the permanent display of such men at Stormont on grounds of parity of esteem. But it is more than that — it is the latest subtle attempt to interpret equality to mean nothing has primacy in NI, not even the symbols of the country that was created, Northern Ireland, or of the state in which it was to stay, the UK, or the people who fought or led for the fact of such a place on this island.While the Republic of Ireland proudly celebrates its history and does not display unionist leaders on a par with its own founders, NI has to behave dferently and let nationalists think that the principle of consent, leading to UK sovereignty here, is a fact of le without consequences.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now SF can control Stormont decision makingYour Morning View yesterday  is a wake-up call. It could be construed as making a laudable case for scrapping Stormont now. In stating “we have a dysal government in which a party that wants NI to fail knows it has to be in office at all times and is allowed to behave as you would expect a party with such aspirations to behave”, the implied criticism is clearly directed at Sinn Fein.  \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Phoney and absurd because minority rule dictates that Sinn Fein has an unchallenged ability to control Executive decision making. It is unworkable when government revolves around the approval of a party dedicated to destroying the influence of the majority pro-union community and undermining its very existence.People have had their fill of the hard won peace from terrorism being disturbed by political upheaval. They have had enough of being denied normality and the harvest of social, economic and political stability.The union itself might be safe but unionist tolerance of interference in Northern Ireland’s internal affairs by Dublin, Brussels and Joe Biden’s Washington has worn thin. The relentless orchestrated pressure on the UK over matters such the NI Protocol and legacy is in fact part of the campaign to “get the Brits out of Ireland” that is being played on Sinn Fein fiddles.Time to remind them and London also that Northern Ireland is not in, and is not a part of, Ireland.Time, therefore, with an election forthcoming, for unionists to decide do they want to negotiate new devolved arrangements or walk clean away from the battering ram of the intransigent Irish republican agenda.David McNarry, Ex UUP and Ukip MLA, ComberThe scrapping of Stormont in  set the tone for London’s approach to Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I said ‘mum, I’m thinking about retirement but I’m not sure’.“She gave me a very straight bit of guidance. She said ‘David, God is not a God of confusion, and you will know when it is right for you to go.“I always had  in my head, but then I did some thinking and I actually joined the Trust on  April  and I worked out in my head thatI went on the  March  that would be  years done to the day.Ballymena manager David Jeffrey on the touchline for the home league match against Portadown last May Photo: Desmond Loughery Pacemaker Press“And with my birthday being the th day of October I thought it was symmetrical.

It is a job which is challenging, and it is dficult, and at times it can be frustrating, but it can also be so rewarding.“There are people who have no family – who are literally all alone – and I count it a privilege to be able to help, and to make even small changes in people’s lives.“I have a real appreciation for the people I work with.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Savage and unprovoked sectarian attack’ on -year-old boy condemnedJamie Bryson seeks legal action against Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill on Northern Ireland ProtocolJoint unionist anger as energy VAT cut is denied for Northern Ireland due to ProtocolIrish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’UDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureMost PopularLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for Rod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenGt ideas for Mothering Sunday: special, unique Mother’s Day presents for Beautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe surgery was earmarked for closure after the property was sold on by the doctors who owned it.Patients registered at the surgery have been re-allocated to other surgeries in Penarth and Dinas Powys.This has prompted calls from some residents as to why the Welsh Government and the health board did not step in to save the surgery.Local MS and economy minister Vaughan Gething - who is also a former Welsh Government health minister - is the main target of blame from some residents.Max Wallis, a former patient, said: \"The health board and the former health minister are to blame - the health minister for setting up a system in which this could happen.\"Helives near the surgery, could see what was happening and did nothing to stop it.\"But, saying \"I understand the signicant disruption\", Mr Gething said that \"neither the Heath Board or Welsh Government could force the sale of the building to them\".Mr Wallis had met with ious officials to see what could be done about the surgery, including proposals to move it to another site.However he said he had been told by the Primary Care Team that they had not been looking at alternative premises as it was not their job.\"They pretended they were trying to do something about it and then said were doing nothing and wash their hands of it,\" said Mr Wallis.\"A complete failure by public authorities.\":Another former patient who opposed the closure of the surgery, Max Scott-Cook, also blames Mr Gething for the situation.Mr Scott-Cook said: \"Mr Vaughan Gething,you were the health secretary, and you were the MS of the of the people in the surgery, why did you not know and why was something not done .remove\"You promised me for three months to get in touch and you havent done.\"You should have intervened and kept that surgery there.\"Mr Scott-Cook also spoke of how some people, though assigned a new surgery, may not be able to attend their new surgery.He also claims there has been a lack of responsibility taken for Albert Road Surgery and said \"it seems to me that it was a situation that no one wanted to take on\".However, despite the anger that follows the surgery being closed, Mr Scott-Cook praised the staff at the surgery.He said he believes the staff there were exceptional, especially Dr Leppik, and did all they could to help the patients they had while the surgery was open.Mr Gething said: \"I understand the signicant disruption caused to patients as a result of the closure of the Albert Road practice.\"I myself have also been a patient at Albert Road.\"I have engaged with the health board, councillors and members of the public through an unsettling time. \"Former partners decided to sell the building and neither the Heath Board or Welsh Government could force the sale of the building to them.\"I would like to thank Dr Leppik and the team for their service in dficult circumstances.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

That switch brings with it all manner of challenges and has led to the international calendar being altered dramatically. This camp is the first of just three that England will have before the tournament gets under way, with this month’s friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast followed by four Nations League matches in June. Southgate’s side finish the group with a double-header in September – the only meet-up of what is usually an autumn schedule comprised of three camps. With so few chances to be with the squad, England need to make the most of this opportunity.Time to tweak the formation “It is important to try dferent formations and tactics,” Southgate said when unveiling his squad last Thursday. “We can use these games to try to understand how we approach the World Cup.” The England boss has tinkered with his tournament approaches depending on the strengths of his squad, with a three-man backline providing the  for their run to the  World Cup semi-finals. Southgate switched to a four-man defence as the Three Lions finished third in the inaugural Nations League finals the following year and used that for the most part of the rearranged Euros. England moved to a back three for the last- clash with Germany and final against Italy, ing to that base in November qualiers.England debuts on the cards vw,vw,px, px\"Marc Guehi has caught the eye for Crystal Palace this season .removeThree defenders are vying to make their bow on Saturday. England Under-s captain Marc Guehi’s fine performances with Crystal Palace led to his call-up for this month’s double-header, with club team-mate Tyrick Mitchell joining him after some withdrawals at the start of the week. Southampton full-back Kyle Walker-Peters was also brought in on Monday as Southgate experiments in the absence of high-profile absentees. The England manager confirmed the trio will feature at some point over the coming days.Who will line up in goal for England  vw,vw,px, px\"Jordan Pickford faces a fight to keep the England goalkeeping jersey Aaron Ramsdale has enjoyed a superb season with Arsenal and was set to win his second cap this month, having made his debut in November’s - cakewalk against San Marino.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdcccaaaecffca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cffcaecbfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648210667218.jpg--recommendation_for_post_primary_pupils_to_wear_facemasks_to_be_scrapped_after_easter.jpg?164821066700","title":"recommendation for post primary pupils to wear facemasks to be scrapped after easter ","story":"It will no longer be recommended that post-primary pupils wear a face covering in corridors or confined communal areas following the Easter break. This will result in post-primary pupils no longer being recommended to wear a face covering on school premises. The news was confirmed by Education Minister Michelle McIlveen.She said, As was the case with the change relating to the use of face coverings in classrooms, this further change takes place in the context of a broadly improving epidemiological landscape in schools. Nonetheless, COVID continues to circulate in our communities and in our schools and we should continue to reduce the risks of COVID in our schools through the range of other mitigating measures that remain in place to protect all pupils and staff.  It is for this reason thatany inidual wishes to continue to use a face covering anywhere at school, I would encourage them to do so. At this point pupils will still be recommended to wear a face covering when using public or school transport. This position will be kept under review.  A guidance note will issue to schools on this issue later today and my Department’s COVID guidance will be updated to reflect this position.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfeeeeabebcdbddfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdcacbabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
