Meanwhile, Harry confirmed a rift with his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and told of how his father Prince Charles - the heir to the throne - had cut him off financially. And the couple, who were expecting their second child at the time, also revealed to Winfrey that they were expecting a girl.Their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in California in June.She was given Queen Elizabeth\u0027s childhood nickname, sparking controversy over whether the royal couple had asked permission to recycle the head of the royal household\u0027s cherished moniker.Harry and Meghan also paid tribute to the Duke\u0027s late mother Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 aged 36.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Labour bids Tory mantle party home ownership","story":"Share this article At its heart was what he dubbed a \u0027contribution society\u0027, where everyone has a part to play.And Sir Keir appeared to show a greater commitment to helping to energise the private sector, with his prospective government promising to \u0027be a partner to private enterprise, not stifle it.\u0027But despite the posturing, there are few if any references to any tangible policies the electorate could pin their hopes to in any future election. He wrote: \u0027People want to emerge from lockdown into something better.\u0027Our country is now at a crossroads: down one path is the same inequality of opportunity and insecurity.\u0027It is impossible to live in this moment and not feel the winds of changes blowing, just as they did in 1945 and 1997.\u0027The Labour path is about building a better future for working people.\u0027Labour will build a society that prizes the contributions people make, providing security and opportunity across Britain.\u0027A Labour source told the Guardian they believed the public \u0027were now willing to give Starmer a hearing\u0027, but warned his vision \u0027must be credible\u0027.They said: \u0027People believe Keir could be prime minister.

The labour market is much smaller than it was before the pandemic began.\u0027We estimate that there is about a million fewer people in the labour market now than there were before the crisis began and probably about a quarter of that is explained by lower migration and that\u0027s mainly lower immigration since the pandemic rather than higher emigration.\u0027About 500,000 of that is explained by more people over 50 who have withdrawn from the labour market. That\u0027s compared with what we would have expected to happen, because over 50s employment and labour market participation has been growing for decades, but that growth has now reversed.\u0027So it\u0027s about half a million is explained by over 50s, while 300,000 is explained by young people in full time education – so more young people more in education.\u0027And there is a little bit which is furlough, which is ending next week, but it looks like that may only be between 200,000-300,000 workers, so it could be around one million workers.\u0027 Asked what the sudden spike in over-50s dropping from the labour market, he said: \u0027It\u0027s a combination of factors. A lot will be the pandemic. It will be people who will have been furloughed, who have taken time away from the labour market and simply aren\u0027t returning.\u0027Some of it will be people who feel they can\u0027t go back to work, they may have been shielding for example and may come back in the future.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk Grimes split three years together","story":"Share this articleElon Musk and Grimes break up after three years together"},{"url":null,"title":"Britains daily Covid cases rise 9 week 35 623 amid spike infections","story":"Share this article   It comes after a damning report revealed yesterday that thousands of cancer patients will die over the next decade because of the devastating treatment backlog caused by the pandemic.Around 19,500 people in England with cancer have not yet been diagnosed due to Covid-related disruption to the NHS.It could take more than a decade to clear this \u0027missing cancer patients backlog\u0027, according to analysis by Institute for Public Policy Research and the CF healthcare consultancy.They calculated that even if \u0027stretched\u0027 hospitals conducted 5 per cent more treatments than pre-pandemic levels, it will take until 2033 to catch up with the cancer backlog.But, with extra funding and staff that figure could be pushed up to 15 per cent – allowing backlogs could be cleared by next year.The study lays bare the catastrophic impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnosis and treatment.During the height of the Covid crisis, from March 2020 to February 2021, 369,000 fewer people than expected were referred to a specialist with suspected cancer.The number of chemotherapy treatments also fell by 187,000, while there were 15,000 fewer radiotherapy treatments.The report suggests the backlog in chemotherapy and radiotherapy could take until 2028 and 2033 respectively to clear.There has also been a dramatic drop in diagnostic procedures, with endoscopies down 37 per cent, MRI scans 25 per cent and CT scans ten per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"We talk to six experts about what awaits university graduates about to enter the workforceWhere do you start if you really want to change the direction of your career?"},{"url":null,"title":"a night of hunting the false widow spider they are everywhere in this area","story":"Venom expert Dr John Dunbar spends a night combing a Dublin housing estate for Ireland’s increasingly common false widow spider. Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Programme\u0026rsquos scale makes Origin Green \u0026lsquounique and effective\u0026rsquoEvents in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Galway among similar demonstrations staged globallyMiche\u0026aacutel Martin insists proposal not doomed despite opposition from Russia and China"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Birds still subjected to \u0026lsquopoisoning, persecution, collision or direct disturbance\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Lukas Barth-TuttasPoolEPATucked into Berlin’s northwest outskirts, Reinickendorf never features prominently in tourist guide books – but it has a special place in Germany’s political wonk almanac.For the last run of federal elections, the political preferences of the 182,000 voters in Reinickendorf, constituency number 77, have mirrored almost perfectly the final result nationwide.Stretching from forests, lakes and villas to industrial landmarks and a high-rise district, Reinickendorf is Germany in miniature.On Friday a final opinion poll showed the country’s main political parties effectively neck-and-neck ahead of Sunday’s federal election.The centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is hoping for a record fifth term with a poll showing 25 per cent support, just one point short of the the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).So after a campaign where the only certainty is its uncertain outcome, how do election oracles in Reinickendorf view Sunday’s vote?Reinickendorf’s best-known politician is Monika Grütters, a senior member of Berlin’s local Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and two-term state secretary for culture in the chancellery. Her department oversees a €2.1 billion annual budget – and she secured the same amount again for emergency cultural pandemic assistance, for artists and cultural institutions.“That was perhaps unique worldwide, that the state held a protective hand over artists,” she said.ClimateOn the campaign trail she says voters were most preoccupied with climate protection, tax – and whether she has plans to keep up contact with Angela Merkel after she leaves the chancellery.“We’ve not made a date but I hope we’ll keep in contact and. . . we can go to the theatre together now and again,” said Ms Grütters.Voters in Reinickendorf, and across the city-state of Berlin, face a bumper election on Sunday, with four different ballot papers: for federal, state and local elections – as well as a controversial referendum on whether the city-state government should be forced to buy back housing from large landlords.Uwe Brockhausen, SPD candidate for local mayor, senses in Reinickendorf a rise in support for his party nationwide. With complicated coalition talks looming, he says affordable housing has been the burning question of this election.“We have to get all levels of politics working together in this to make it the first priority after election,” he said.On the busy Residenzstrasse, local man Torsten Buchmann says, in between bites of his midday kebab, that this is why he’ll be voting SPD.“We need more flats people can afford and more fair pay, particularly for nurses and carers who worked so hard in the pandemic,” he said. Sabine Richter, waiting nearby in front of a shop, says the Greens will be getting her vote because “climate politics are the most important for me right now”.DemonstrationSome 7km to the south, Fridays for Future founder Greta Thunberg led a demonstration of 40,000 mostly young people through the capital. Though German greenhouse gas emissions have dropped 41 per cent compared with 1991, she said Germany remained the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the EU and was “objectively one of the biggest climate villains”.None of Germany’s main political parties had in their election programmes, she said, “come even close” to meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement.“You must vote, but remember that voting only will not be enough, we must keep going into the streets,” she said.After touring dozens of Germany’s 299 constituencies, lead candidates began a final push on Friday to win support, and secure the chancellery after the departure of Angela Merkel from power, after four terms and 16 years. “There are a lot of people who decide quite late,” Merkel said at her final election appearance on Friday in Munich. “I would call on everyone to use their vote.”Her successor as CDU leader, Armin Laschet, said in Munich it was “going to be a tight result”.“All of Europe is watching this German election and all hope that Germany will remain strong,” he said, repeating his warning of an SPD-lead leftist coalition.In Cologne, SPD chancellor hopeful Olaf Scholz rammed home his key election message: more respect and better wages for lower earners. Tax cuts for the wealthy, as proposed by the CDU, were “out of step and lacking solidarity”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"germany s main political parties almost level ahead of election poll","story":"The Allensbach polling institute placed Dr Anglea Merkel’s CDU party on 25 per cent support.

The Greens, on 16 per cent in Friday’s poll, favours a traffic light coalition – seeing more chance of progressive climate policy.The FDP favours the Jamaica option, given overlap with the CDU on tax relief plans for businesses and top earners.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fracking idiots ignore energy doorstep","story":"The current energy crisis should come as no surprise. The market has been tampered with and taxed to such an extent that it can scarcely be called a market at all. Investing in energy supply has become unlike most normal financial decisions. The rate of return you can secure will depend not so much on the extent to which you have discovered some new innovatory process or a wizard way to improve productivity and efficiency. Instead, how the government choses to legislate and regulate the sector in the years to come is likely to be the key determinant of the money you make.To the sort of mess we currently have in our inflexible energy market, it is usually an amalgamation of a series of factors and an aggregation of poor previous decision-making. Nowhere is this more obviously the case than in our total failure to embrace a fracking revolution and unleash the potential of shale gas.In the 25 years from 1980, the UK produced more energy than it needed, but since the turn of the century that has started to unravel – we now import more than third of our energy and about 60 per cent of our natural gas. This might not be so bad if we were genuinely sourcing cheap and efficient alternatives to homegrown energy. But it is a problem if we have instead squandered major opportunities in Britain.A glance across the Atlantic gives a glimpse of what shale gas can achieve. Since 2005, the USA has gone from importing 15 per cent of their gas to being a net exporter. Household energy bills have fallen by around 40 per cent thanks to shale gas coming onstream. Other benefits have been enormous too – literally millions of jobs have been created and fracking has played a major role in America’s impressive 20 per cent reduction in energy-related emissions in the last 20 years.If we could replicate even a fraction of these results in Britain the results would be tremendous. In 2014 it was estimated by the British Geological Survey that the UK has 1,300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in shale, and if just 10 per cent of this were extracted from the ground it could heat all British homes for a century. However, this is a gift horse whose mouth we have simply decided to stare at.There is currently a ban on fracking consents and the last operational fracking site in the UK closed in 2019. Successful lobbying efforts by environmentalist campaigners and local residents’ associations have strangled this nascent revolution at birth.The protests against this new source of gas have hinged on the increase in traffic inevitably associated with running a fracking site, alongside ludicrously exaggerated – or totally baseless - fears about the potential to cause earthquakes or pollute the water supply. Being unimpressed by having busier roads and the associated uptick in local pollution is a reasonable stance to take. However, there is no reason why such disruption could not be resolved easily through offering financial compensation packages to affected households.It would be too generous to describe the government’s energy policy over recent years as amounting to any sort of strategy. It’s simply been a plethora of panicked interventions, which in turn require further interventions to right the wrongs of previous ones. The government has, however, made choices. When it comes to fracking, they have decided to allow worries about modest traffic disruption and over-blown environmental claims to destroy the opportunity to access much cleaner, cheaper energy and create many thousands of new jobs.Craven caution comes at a price and we are now paying it. As more and more energy suppliers go bust, energy bills will skyrocket even further, causing fuel poverty, and avoidable deaths from hypothermia this winter. This is a choice we should surely revisit.More from NewsBring in emergency powers to stop Insulate Britain protests, police tell ministersOlly Stephens: Parents of autistic teen murdered in plot hatched on social media call for tighter restrictionsSabina Nessa: Police release CCTV footage of man they want to speak to in connection with murderMichael Gove could water down planning changes as rebel Tory MPs demand vetoDoctor Who goes back in time as Russell T Davies takes charge againSabina Nessa: murdered teacher’s attacker struck moments from her doorstepMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"blind paralympic who glued himself","story":":root Blind Paralympian who glued himself to roof of British Airways plane jailedFormer two-time gold medallist James Brown, who represented himself during his trial, was jailed today after costing British Airways £, and disrupting  passengers Image: PAByHenry VaughanShiler Mahmoudi:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsA former Paralympian and Extinction Rebellion activist who glued himself to the roof a plane has been jailed for a year.On October  , athlete James Brown, , managed to climb onto the British Airways aircraft and superglued himself to its roof as part of an Extinction Rebellion protest against flying at London City Airport. Brown, who is completely blind and had previously been awarded two gold medals for Great Britain in cycling and athletics, glued his right hand on the plane that was headed to Amsterdam. He had also pushed his mobile phone into the door to stop it from closing, and was able to hold the plane up for an hour before being removed. Northern Ireland-born Brown had also gone on to represent Ireland in cross-country skiing, but was arrested after he caused disruption to more than  British Airways passengers, costing the airline £,.  Brown represented himself during his trial and denied one count of causing a public nuisance, claiming he had to do something spectacular to draw attention to the climate crisis. On Friday  September, he was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court in July after a jury deliberated for less than an hour and Judge Gregory Perrins sentenced him to  monthsapos imprisonment, of which he will serve half.He told Brown: The right to protest does not entitle you to cause major widespread disruption to a major airport... simply because you think it is the right thing to do. Judge Perrins said: This is a case in which you acted together with at least  other activists to plan and execute a major act of disruption.You intended to cause the maximum amount of disruption possible at the airportnot shut it down completely.The judge told accomplished athlete Brown: You cynically used your disability to put your plan into action, adding: You put your own le at risk by climbing on top of the plane.He said he accepted Brown was motivated by a desire to bring about a change you genuinely believe is for the benefit of all and that there must be a sense of proportionality when sentencing those who commit offences during a protestDramatic stunts that changed the world as Greenpeace celebrates its th anniversaryBut he told Brown there is no entitlement to more lenient treatment because he was protesting about the environment.The court heard that Brown had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt and had been offered assistance boarding due to his disability.He had a bottle of superglue in his luggage that had not been detected by security, prosecutor Richard Witcombe told the jury during Brownaposs trial.Brown declined an offer by a member of cabin staff to help him to his seat, telling her that he was going to climb on to the roof of the plane.Giving evidence, he wept as he told jurors: I was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.In an emotional speech, married father-of-four Brown, who runs a charity, said: My protest, the purpose I hope is clear, my motivation was to maximise media attention to the climate crisis, which back at that time was hardly receiving any. Tim Maloney QC, defending Brown at his sentencing hearing, said: He has expressed an intention not to become involved in unlawful protest again.Mr Maloney said Brown has overcome the barriers to live a successful and inspiring le, competing at five Paralympic games and becoming a successful businessman.There is so much more to his le than sporting excellence, he said as he described Brownaposs career as a maths teacher before working for Gloucestershire County council in disabled childrenaposs services.He also built a conference centre aimed at meeting the needs of disabled people and set up Mobiloo, a company which provides facilities for disabled people at festivals and events.

Scotlandaposs Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain QC announced that those caught with Class A substances could receive a police warning rather than prosecution. Police will be able to use their discretion in inidual cases - but those supplying hard drugs will still face criminal charges.The Labour leader, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, said the decision was probably the right thing to do - but said drug laws should not be ripped up.Officers can already use their discretion to issue warnings to those caught with Class B and C drugs - such as barbiturates and cannabis - under current Scottish laws. This has now been extended to Class A substances, which also include ecstasy, crack cocaine and magic mushrooms. In the interview with ITVaposs Representing Border, Mr Starmer said: There is a world of dference between a decision not to prosecute a particular case and ripping up the drug laws. It is not unusual in any legal system for those caught with small amounts of cannabis not to be prosecuted. I donapost think many people would argue that that discretion isnapost sensible. The very same in Scotland - there is a world of dference between that exercise and saying aposdo you think drug laws should be scrapped apos to which my answer is no.

Scotlandaposs drug minister Angela Constance hailed the move as very signicant as Scotland aims to reduce drugs deaths - which reached a record , in .  She added the change will only be an option in cases of possession for inidual use, not where someone is suspected of being involved in supplying drugs to others. Ms Constance told BBC Radio Scotland the change had been welcomed by all parties at Holyrood with the exception of the Conservatives. Conservative justice spokesman Jamie Greene said the change means people will now be receiving the same punishment for carrying Class A drugs as they would for urinating in public.He added: Under the SNP, drug deaths have become our national shame, but their plans for an effective decriminalisation of drugs is not the way to solve this scandal.He insisted the Government must rethink this dangerous approach, which dilutes how seriously we treat possession of the most deadly drugs in our society.

The Labour leaderaposs much-trailed ,-word essay aposThe Road Aheadapos hits back at criticism he has failed to outline a plan for power in the  months since he seized the helm. It was published by the Fabian Society as MPs, campaigners and activists gear up for the partyaposs conference in Brighton. Here is what we have learned from the Labour leaderaposs y treatise.Starmer set out aposten principlesapos for a aposcontribution societyaposThe former Director of Public Prosecutions sets out ten principles for what he calls a contribution society in which everyone has a part to play but people are rewarded for putting in. These principles are:We will always put hard-working families and their priorities first If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be rewarded fairly People and businesses are expected to contribute to society, as well as receive Your chances in le should not be defined by the circumstances of your birth – hard work and how you contribute should matter Families, communities and the things that bring us together must once again be put above inidualism The economy should work for citizens and communities. It is not good enough to just surrender to market forces The role of government is to be a partner to private enterprise, not stle it The government should treat taxpayer money asit were its own. The current levels of waste are unacceptable The government must play its role in restoring honesty, decency and transparency in public le We are proudly patriotic but we reject the isiveness of nationalismStarmer sees the Covid pandemic as a turning pointThe Labour leader sees Covid- as a major turning point for Britain, akin to that of the recovery from World War .Starmer tells a tale of two pandemics, saying lockdown was a more dficult, damaging experience for poorer people than it was for the more affluent. The burden fell on those who couldn’t work from home and those who were already struggling, he says.He goes on to say people want to emerge from lockdown into something better, as Brits did when they emerged from the Second World War, adding: I believe we are living through a time when the inidualism that prioritises personal entitlement, moral superiority and self-interest is receding in society’s rear-view mirror.  He says: “Britain under the next Labour government will no longer be trampled by the tyranny of low expectations. “If we are to reimagine what is possible, we will need to demand high standards. “If we are to unlock the vast reserves of potential and productivity in this country, we will need to be restless. “If we are to overcome cynicism, we will need to be the party of practical action.”Labour is pro-business and will aposfixapos the Brexit dealBoris Johnson once reportedly said f*** business when told firms feared Brexit would damage the economy. Trade barriers have added an extra £m in cost since Britain left the EU and there is a growing frustration over red tape, staff shortagesand empty supermarket shelves. Starmer underlines he sees business as a force for good and pledges to fix the holes in the shoddy Brexit deal and rebuild ties with Europe. He says: We have seen from the government’s failure to properly manage our departure from the European Union what happens when the expertise and concerns of business are ignored. The sight of empty shelves in our supermarkets should be embarrassing to ministers who failed to understand the complex supply chains and streamlined logistics that British businesses rely upon. By creating unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, the government has cost both businesses and consumers. The Labour leader has very little to say on immigration, however, saying only that the idea that the immigration and social security systems are a free-for-all has been fertile territory for populist politicians, who have sowed mistrust. Labour will refuse to fight the culture wars Many claim Boris Johnsonaposs Tories are keen to fight the next election on the culture wars and woke issues, as campaigners raise questions on Britainaposs history, and racial, gender and social equality. Starmer calls the Tories war on woke an increasingly bizarre obsession and makes clear that he sees the battleground dferently. Rather, he thinks Labour should not wade into every row and instead focus on opposing the conspiracy theories, crankery, misinformation and hatred allowed to flourish, often as part of the debate.  He says the Government has many slogans, such as levelling up, but adds: In the absence of a defining economic project or plan, theTories have instead plunged headfirst into the murky depths of the so-called ‘culture wars’. Building bonds between fellow citizens has never been more crucial, he later adds. But rather than take on these challenges, the Conservatives have tried to exploit isions, leading to an increasingly bizarre obsession with what happens on university campuses, a crime bill that offers statues of slavers more protection than women walking down the street, and McCarthyite accusations of Marxist plots against everyone from teachers to those protesting racism. But Starmer has some fighting talk for the SNP Rather than the culture wars, Starmer sees the SNPaposs push for independence and what he calls the rise of the multi-headed hydra of nationalism as a more immediate threat.Hinting at how Labour might make the case for the Union in any second independence referendum north of the border, he claims the SNP and Scottish Tories feed off ision.He says: Both the SNP and the Conservatives use culture to distract and deflect, creating ision between people of these islands. The business of effective governance and improving people’s lives comes second to ideology. Both use nationalism freely to whip up fear of the other.  He adds: Nationalists like to portray themselves as patriots. But patriotism and nationalism are not the same. In fact, they are opposites. Nationalism represents an attempt to ide people from one another patriotism is an attempt to unite people of dferent backgrounds. Nationalism is about the casting out of the other patriotism is about finding common ground. Nationalism is the flag as a threat. Patriotism is the flag as a celebration. These are lines which will be highly contested by Nicola Sturgeon and other pro-independence figures. The Corbyn era and Labour aposnavel gazingapos is officially over Frustration at Corbynaposs rejection of Blairaposs years in power run through the treatise, with Starmer fuming that in recent years the party has been squabbling over its own past, rather than one focused on the future. He contrasts Labouraposs towering achievement in government with long periods of self-doubt and navel-gazing and lambasts his predecessor, saying: We had moved from being the party of ‘white heat’ to the party of sepia-tinged nostalgia. He adds: In recent decades, the legacy of the  Labour government has become contested to the extent that the party has at times felt like separate families living under one roof. This has been harmful and alienating. It has not progressed the cause of achieving a Labour government and has been damaging to our country. Jeremy Corbyn is not mentioned once in the document Boris Johnsonwhile the word aposfutureapos crops up some  times.Tony Blair is back in fashion In , Blair gave the  anniversary lecture for the Fabian Society, and he called it Let Us Face The Future. In Starmeraposs essay, for the same think tank, the Labour leader appears to directly reference Blairaposs critique of his party in , writing We must take inspiration from  – but that cannot mean dwelling on the past. Instead, we must face the future. He adds: “It is impossible to live in this moment and not feel the winds of changes blowing, just as they did in  and .”  He also mirrors some of New Labouraposs language, calling for a new settlement between the government, business and working people, a new deal for working people and an effective partnership of state and private sector, which sees Starmer distance himself from Corbynaposs policies of renationalising services like utilities and rail. Throughout, Starmer holds up Blairaposs, and Gordon Brownaposs successes and ambition for the country in opposition to the Toriesapos record. Starmer backs new laws to tackle racial inequality - but is less clear on trans rights Starmer pledges a new Race Equality Act and his view to tackle complex structural racism which exists in Britain. This follows the vile racism faced by England stars such as Marcus Rashford after they took the knee at games and outcry over a highly-criticised Government-commission report which claimed to have found no evidence of systemic racism in the UK. The Labour leader writes: When people across the world come together to say that black lives matter, when England footballers take the knee before the biggest games of their lives and when black people chant ‘we can’t breathe’,they aren’t asking for more nice words or inquiries – they are demanding real progress. We would introduce a new Race Equality Act in the UK, aimed at tackling the complex structural racism that holds back people from every community. While Labour has said separately that it backs reforming Gender Recognition Act and self-declaration for trans people, Starmeraposs essay makes no mention of trans rights.Mental health waiting list targets Starmer said, as Blair set his Government waiting NHS waiting list targets in , he would back similar targets for mental health services. This follows reports that people needing support for mental health problems ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosis and eating disorders are left waiting months and in some cases years for help. He said: The  Labour government set ambitious targets for waiting lists in the NHS and they worked: the next Labour government will set ourselves the same challenge on mental health. The mental health charity Mind suggest that just one in eight adults with a mental health problem are currently getting treatment  and waiting lists are soaring. The leader plans to stick around... and for a long time  Perhaps most revealing were the final words of Starmeraposs treatise, in which he makes clear he in post for the long haul. It comes amid speculation he could face a challenge from the Left of his party and critics pointing out that Labour has yet to catch up with the Tories in the polls while an election could come as early as . Starmer says: To anyone who believes in a better future, based on these principles, I say: join us. The road ahead will be long. The journey will not always be simple. But the choices are clear and the prize at the end great. At this historic moment, Labour has a chance to once again build a better country for working people.

At its party conference this weekend Lucy Powell, Shadow Housing Secretary, is expected to unveil her plans to re-establish the link between genuinely affordable housing and average earnings. Labour hopes to bring affordable rents and the dream of home ownership closer for those locked out of the system today. They will also stop foreign investors snapping up homes before they are built, and often leaving them empty.

The Department for Educationtoday announces it has expanded its Glasses in Classes scheme to reach more than , pupils in at least  schools in England. It was trialled in Bradford and will now be expanded to Doncaster, Derby, Durham, Norwich and Breckland, and the North Yorkshire Coast. Children identied as needing glasses will receive one pair for home and one for school to help improve reading and writing skills. Children can already get free eye tests and vouchers for glasses but experts fear many poorer pupils do not have sight problems spotted in time. Under the scheme, pupils receive support from a vision co-ordinator, usually a teaching assistant, to attend follow-up eye examinations, get their prescription glasses and wear them regularly.  Schools do not usually get the results of vision screenings that pupils take in reception. But during the pilot, these results were shared with staff in schools so they knew which pupils and families to support. The scheme, first piloted at  primary schools in Bradford, aims to prevent disadvantaged pupils from being left behind because of poor eyesight. It will now be adapted for five disadvantaged areas in England under the DfEaposs Opportunity Areas programme - where the Government has targeted more resources at  social mobility cold spots. Speaking on National Eye Health Week, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: As a young boy shortly after arriving in this country, I sat at the back of the classroom with poor language skills and low confidence, struggling to engage with my lessons. Back then, I could never have dreamt of the opportunities this country would give me and I am determined to help every young person overcome obstacles, just as I was supported. Too many children still struggle with the literacy skills they need to make the most of their education. Simple steps like providing free glasses to those that need them so they can clearly see words on a page, for example, can help close the literacy gap and foster a love of learning. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This novel scheme focuses on young people whose learning is hampered by poor eyesight and whose circumstances mean they have either not been to see an optician or do not have the glasses they need. It is refreshing to see the Government reacting positively to a local initiative that has seen results in Bradford and extending it to a further five disadvantaged areas in the north of the country. It would be greatit could eventually be rolled out on a national basis to bring the same benefits to all young people. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: It is essential that the Government invests more in education and young people, and does so without delay. Programmes like this are encouraging but what the education sector is crying out for is a fully funded strategy for education recovery which meets the needs of all pupils in all areas of the country. Thereaposs no time to waste, particularly because the Comprehensive Spending Review will be delivered next month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Mirror understands there are “live discussions” inside the Department for Work and Pensionsabout changing the “taper rate” to let working families keep more money.A proposal under discussion would see the taper - which is the amount of Universal Credit withdrawn for every pound someone earns - cut from p to p. Sources say the DWP is lobbying the Treasury to improve the rate as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs October  Budget. The Treasury is said to be exploring the idea.It would be the first taper change in five years, and would partially cushion the blow of the £-a-week cut - which kicks into payments between October  and November . Scroll down for an explanation of what this all means. Are you struggling on Universal Credit  E-mail webnews@mirror.  The £billion-a-year move would leave many working benefit claimants p better off, rather than the current p, for every pound they earn after tax. But sources are downbeat about whether Mr Sunak - who is demanding Whitehall cuts ahead of his Spending Review - will authorise the move. Mr Sunak has already stonewalled pleas to stop the £-a-week cut, which will save him £bn-a-year but throw hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. Evena p change in the taper is approved, it will not come close to making up for the £-a-week cut for most families. A -year-old single mum working  hours a week on minimum wage could be £. a week better offthe taper rate was cut from p to p.  But because UC is being cut by £ across the board, she would still be £. worse off than she is now. And those still covered by work allowances, or too sick to work, would not benefit at all from changes to the taper. Karl Handscomb of the Resolution Foundation think tank said: “Reducing the taper rate in Universal Credit would raise incentives for workers to earn more – and boost living standards by allowing them to keep more of their earnings. But while welcome, this is no alternative to maintaining the £ a week uplt to Universal Credit. The gains are far smaller than the £ a week cut, and would flow to better off families on UC while three million families would gain nothing at all. Virtually all households would still be signicantly worse off overall.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was blasted for claiming families could work an extra two hours to make up for the £ cut. Experts said many would have to work six hours due to the taper - or nine hoursthey pay tax and national insurance. A person with knowledge of the talks told the Mirror there is now no hope of reversing the £-a-week cut. Focus is turning to the taper instead, they said, adding: “It may be that they say the cut is going ahead - but here’s a lollipop”.  A second source said cutting the taper would help push claimants towards working more hours - as Ms Coffey suggested. After job vacancies topped a million, the source said: “When the economy’s growing and there are lots of job vacancies, more money should go into the taper rate because when people start work they keep more of their money. It’s an incentive.” Every penny cut from the taper would cost £million a year once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, the IFS think tank says. Some .million out of .million claimants have a job, and could benefit from a cut in the taper. Not all would benefit as some are already spared the taper, due to having a work allowance and earnings under £ a month. UCaposs architect Iain Duncan Smith, who has demanded ministers halt the £ cut, originally wanted the taper to be p but was overruled by George Osborne.Mr Duncan Smith appeared to reveal talks about the taper were under way in a Commons debate this week. He urged Ms Coffey to use his bid to stop the cut “as justication for her negotiations with the Treasury to secure a better investment in the taper.” Labour announced last month it would cut the taper, but has not said what the new taper should be.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the Mirror: Rising food costs, tax hikes, the energy crisis and cuts to Universal Credit are a perfect storm facing working families. Itaposs not too late for the Government to change course and cancel their cut. Labour is on the side of working people, thataposs why we would maintain the uplt and reduce the taper rate to allow people to keep more of the money they earn when we replace Universal Credit. The Lords Economic Committee called last year for a cut in the taper, saying the poorest in society were being hit with a “very high effective tax rate”. The committee, led by Tory former employment minister Lord Forsyth, said: “The principle of always making work pay has been undermined by cuts.”By buying a little bit extra with the weekly shop and putting it in the donation box located in-store, customers can help Lidl meet its target of donating million meals a year to those in need. Lidl is helping to tackle hunger in Britain’s communities through its Feed it Back scheme and has teamed up with partner Neighbourly to ensure any donated food will be put to good use every day.The key items to pop in the box are: Cereal Soup Pasta Rice Tinned tomatoes or pasta sauce Lentils, beans and pulses Tinned meat Tinned vegetables Tea and coffee Tinned fruit Biscuits UHT milk Fruit juice. Find out more about Lidlaposs Feed it Back scheme here. What is the taper rate in Universal Credit  Universal Credit allows people to keep claiming eventhey get a job, because some jobs pay so badly that the wage is not enough to sustain a family. If you earn money from a job while on UC, your benefits are tapered away by a set amount depending on how much youaposve earned after tax. For every £ you earn over a set threshold, your benefits are reduced by p. That means effectively youaposre only p better off for every £ you earn after tax. The taper is designed to aposmake work payapos - to smooth people off UC as they re-enter the world of work without abandoning them completely. But critics and charities have long said the taper is just too high. It leaves too little incentive to get a job because people need - hours just to make £. The taper doesnapost apply to earnings that you make under a work allowance - £ a monthyou get housing help, and £ a monthyou donapost. However, only some claimants are eligible for a work allowance - in other words,they have responsibility for a child or limited capability for work. Even those who are eligible will tip over the work allowance and into the taperthey work just eight hours a week at minimum wage.

Rising energy prices Tories have admitted that Brits face a tough winter ahead - with people in the North more likely to be hammered by rising energy prices.A surge in global gas prices has put pressure on domestic energy suppliers, several of which have already gone bust.Spiralling wholesale costs look set to filter down to household bills.The energy price cap protects consumers from sudden hikes in their bills, but it also means that suppliers have gone to the wall as they can’t pass on higher costs to their customers.But some .million households have seen their providers collapse, meaning they face uncertainty about which company will take on their supply and how much it will cost.The energy price cap is already set to rise on October  by £, and ministers are in talks with regulator Ofgem about the next review in Aprilgas costs remain high.Petrol shortagesMotorists are facing fuel shortages at the pumps as a lack of HGV drivers wreaked havoc on the supply chain.BP, Esso and Tesco petrol forecourts were hit by shortages, with large queues reported on Friday as drivers tried to fill up.BP said that around  of its , petrol forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, with between  and  sites affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel.There is a shortage of , drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with the situation exacerbated by Covid pressures and Brexit red tape.Ministers were locked in talks on Friday over how to alleviate the shortage, with changes to immigration rules considered to make it easier for foreign drivers to fill the gap. Empty shelvesShoppers have already seen some empty shelves due to a shortage of carbon dioxide linked to the global gas shortage.US-owned fertiliser plant CF Industries was handed a Government bailout to restart its UK operations after halting production due to the gas price rise.Its UK plants are major suppliers of CO, which it produces as a by-product.Carbon dioxide is used for a range of things in the food sector, including stunning animals before slaughter and keeping fresh products chilled.The shortage of lorry drivers has also compounded issues.Retailers warned there were just  days to save Christmas from signicant disruption due to the lack of hauliers.The British Retail Consortiumsaid festive disruption would be inevitableprogress is not made swtly. Furlough comes to an end The furlough scheme will shut down next week on September . One million Brits are set to still be on furlough when it comes to an end, experts have revealed. The Resolution Foundation projected one million employees are set to remain on the scheme right up until the last moment. Of those, “the majority” willto their jobs but hundreds of thousands will need to find new work in October. Since it launched last March, furlough has supported .million jobs by paying up to % of people’s wages - at a cost of nearly £billion to the taxpayer.But there are fears of a cost of living crisis - as energy bills are rising on October  and Universal Credit payments are being slashed from October .Covid winter A leading health expert said Coronavirus could resemble the common cold by spring as peopleaposs immunity to the virus is boosted by vaccines and exposure. But we still have a fierce winter ahead of us. Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, himself admitted winter needs to pass as double jabbed Brits are still at risk of the virus. In the coming weeks we could see Covid hospitalisations in England rising to more than , a day, according to Government scientic advisors. This would be higher than the third lockdown peak. Worryingly for the Government, which has said that instructing people to work from home is only a “possibility”cases soar, SPI-M said there was “clear consensus” that the measure had kept the pandemic under control in recent months. Boris Johnson outlined his plan for tackling Covid over the winter months, a period when respiratory viruses thrive.Plan aposAapos revolves around booster jabs for the over-s and vaccinating - to -year-olds. While plan aposBapos, measures enforced could include mandatory vaccine passports, face masks in public places and encouraging people to work from home. Universal Credit A million and a half working people face being plunged into “hardship” this winter as their benefits are slashed by £ a week, at the end of this month. Citizens Advice research showed % of working claimants fear they will struggle to pay bills, fall into debt or be forced to sell belongings to make up for the £,-a-year shortfall in their income. About one in four working recipients - equivalent to , people - worry they will be unable to afford food or other basic necessities like toiletries.Even Boris Johnson could not sayhe could survive on the usual Universal Credit payment earlier this week.The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month.The temporary “uplt” was announced in March last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain.Calls to extend the rise are mounting amid growing warnings of a winter living standards crisis.

He attempted to pay for his fare on board using a £ Scottish sterling note and claims to have been told the note was not a legal tender. It left him with no option but to walk the two mile journey to school which involved crossing the Conwy bridge and busy roads from Llandudno Junction.Speaking to North Wales Live, Kelly said: “I noticed The Arriva app wasn’t working earlier that morning when I tried buying Ashtonaposs bus ticket for him to get to school. “I gave him a five pound note, to get afor the day in hope that the app would work the following day so he could get his ‘M-Ticket’. “Unfortunately it happened to be a Scottish sterling note - which, regardless is a legal tender. “Ashton was waiting with friends on Victoria Drive for the bus and when it came the driver refused the payment, and told him the payment wasn’t a valid form of payment and refused to accept the note and making him exit the bus before it left. “He was left alone at one of Llandudno Junctions’ busiest points at half eight in the rush hour morning whilst the bus drove off with his friends on. “Having only been at the school two weeks, and turning  only six months ago, Ashton was left to walk to school which is just over two- miles from the bus stop in the freezing cold crying his eyes out that early in the morning. “He recently had stitches in his eyebrow from a head injury, and the stitches are noticeable, yet that driver still refused him, anything could have happened on that route to school.” She says she has contacted Arriva about what happened, but claims sheaposs had no apology, only a comment confirming that no child should be left alone at the side of the street. She added: Iaposm thankful that Ashton was so nervous about starting the school as this allowed me to drive the route with him several times before the term started, little did I know that would come into play for such silly reasons. ”You hand over your child to them. You expect that your child will be able to get to school safely. As a grown man, making a child walk two miles to school, that driver should feel ashamed of himself.” Arriva has apologised for the incident after being contacted by MirrorOnline and said they will speak to the family. It said in a statement: We apologise for this incident, which has been fully investigated by our Depot team with the driver.It is our intention to reach out to the family directly on this matter. The safety of our customers, and our staff, whilst travelling with Arriva is our main priority. Arrivaaposs website states: Children aged under  and those people who, in the reasonable opinion of the driver, are vulnerable, at risk or in distress, and are unable to pay their fare will be carried at all times. They may be asked to provide their name and address in order that the fare due could be collected at a later date. In these circumstances, the driver will issue a single ticket for one journey allowing the inidual to travel to their home or the nearest stop thereto.

Residents joke the bus stop in Fleering, Essex, which has been newly installed, was made for giants. Local Councillor Paul Thorogood has said that his legs dangle when he sits on the seat- and he is ft tall. The height of the seats isn’t very user-friendly...unless you’re a giant! he complained. Iaposm ft and my legs are hanging off the edge. For a ft ins tall pensioner with a dodgy knee or hip it’s totally unusable. The bus shelter seats are meant to be  inches high. But one is  inches and the other is  inches.  Theyaposre brand new and should be fitted at the correct height. Cllr Thorogood said the developer that paid for the new bus stops, Bloor Homes, did so as part of a deal whereby they would erect  new homes in the area. However, it is Essex County Council and not Bloor Homes that must pay for any upkeep, leaving the tax payer to foot the bill for the replacement.

A staggering  percent of adults living in Cardf don’t feel safe at all on the streets at night, while another  percent worry about their safety even during the daytime. Nearly four in tenliving in Birmingham have installed CCTV and alarms at home to curb their fears about safety. Just under halfof people living in London would feel much safer with a police station in their neighbourhood - and just over a quarter in the capital would even consider legally owning a gun or kne for self-protection.  In comparison, Sheffield, Southampton, and Edinburgh came out as the top three safest cities to live in, with less than one in ten adults in the Scottish capital experiencing any sort of crime. Half of those in Southampton would recommend living in the city to friends, due to feeling so secure there. The stats emerged in a study to mark the launch of the new series of crime drama Murdertown on Crime+Investigation.  A spokesman said: Despite being popular living spots, it’s surprising to see some of the most common cities deemed unsafe - particularly the likes of Cardf, London and Birmingham. “There are clear concerns of activity from the British public that they could be a victim or witness a crime when walking around at night or even in during the daytime. “The new TV series will aim to uncover the most shocking murders in the UK and examine the impact they had on the cities around them.” Norwich and Leicester complete the top five safest cities, while Bristol and Leeds come further down the chart, ranking th and th. Researchers found Londoners are most likely to have experienced crime in the capital- an increase of  percent since . Most common wrongdoings include unprovoked acts of violence , fraudand muggings . And over a quarter of adultsin Cardf have witnessed a crime - up from  percent three years ago.  Almost a thirdadmitted they were a victim of crime themselves, compared to just  percent of adults living in the Welsh city in . Of these illegal acts, home break-ins were most common , followed by fraudand car theft- indicating crime activity has increased since  and during the pandemic. But research, commissioned via OnePoll, found overall  percent of adults would remain in the area they live in as they feel safe when in their own home. And to make their property safer to live in,  percent have installed smart lights that turn on when they’re outdoors, and  percent have added in extra locks around the house. Other measures added to make their home secure include security cameras, growing big hedges around the property and buying a guard dog. Outside of the home, one in five respondents feels safe most of the time - but six in ten won’t go out after dark unless they have to.  And one fth would feel safer in their citythey didn’t know of so many attacks or break-ins nearby, while  percent can’t help but pay attention to local gossip. For a resounding four in ten adults, a bigger police presence would make them feel more protected, while a third want more CCTV and one quarter want a local police station. When it comes to law enforcement, more than half of British adults do not feel the police are able to keep their area safe. And  percent feel women in particular are being let down by the police following the Sarah Everard case. The spokesman for Murdertown added: “The UK police force play a vital role in keeping our cities safe and ensure people feel comfortable to go about their normal lives without causing any issues. “Of course, that’s easier said than done when staffing levels can be an issue, and some cities have such high crime rates to contend with.”There will be more stories unveiled in Murdertown’s new ten-part series which premieres on Crime+Investigation on th September at pm.TOP  SAFEST CITIES TO LIVE IN THE UK...Edinburgh Southampton Sheffield Norwich Leicester Manchester Newcastle Cambridge Liverpool Glasgow Bristol Leeds Birmingham London CardfMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVCrimeCity of CardfSouth Wales PoliceCity of Edinburgh\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It marked the start of a dark decade that culminated in the infamous aposWinter of Discontentapos, where industrial action left mountains of rubbish piled up in the streets and severe weather cut off access to entire towns.With commentators now warning the Government faces a similar season of turmoil, here is how Britain was thrust into chaos - and risks being so once more. Pubs shut and TV curbed in aposthree-day weekapos Rising inflation troubled the economy throughout the s and to tackle it, pay caps were imposed on major industries including coal mining.

Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhile the motion was not passed, an overtime ban was imposed that crippled the coal industry and forced prime minister Ted Heath to take drastic measures. At midnight on December , the Tory leader took the unprecedented step of introducing a three-day working week - meaning businesses could only operate for a maximum of three consecutive days. In scenes similar to lockdown, most pubs shut their doors, while even TV broadcasts were limited. The BBC and ITV implemented a staggered shutdown, shutting off at .pm in alternating nights. As blackouts hit the country, it was even speculated that the Army could be called in to haul coal and work at power stations. In January , the NUM upped the stakes by going on strike and Heath responded by calling a general election.Feeling Brits would side with the Government, the Conservatives ran with the campaign slogan aposWho governs Britain apos The move backfired, however, with Labour taking the most seats. Labouraposs Harold Wilson ed to power in a minority government and cemented a majority in a second election that October. The miners were granted a  per cent pay increase, but the wave of discontent spreading across Britain had just begun. aposWinter of Discontentapos saw rubbish pile up in Leicester Square In the winter of – there were widespread strikes by public sector trade unions against the Governmentaposs attempts to curb wage increases. With Jim Callaghan now prime minister, the Labour leadership was once again battling rapid inflation, but faced internal disputes over the pay caps from members committed to the partyaposs socialist roots.  By the end of , lorry drivers had gone on strike, driving the country to a halt just as temperatures plummeted. In the coldest winter for  years, freezing weather cut off access to towns, with local authorities struggling to clear roads blaming staff shortages. Even football was affected as an entire round of the FA Cup was postponed for the first time in its history. With more than , strikes erupting around Britain, grim images of the consequences flooded newspaper front pages. Refuse collectors refused to pick up bags of rubbish, which piled up in Leicester Square, while even gravediggers joined the walkout.Their actions were demonised in headlines like “Now They Won’t Let Us Bury Our Dead!” and last year one union official promised the Mirror never again - though insisted low-paid workers were treated like dogs”.  Returning from a Caribbean summit, Callaghanaposs insistence that the situation did not amount to mounting chaos was met with derision. The Sun ran a front page headlined aposCrisis, what Crisis apos and quoted Shakespeareaposs opening line from Richard III, aposNow is the winter of our discontentapos - a phrase that came to define the era. As Tory leader Margaret Thatcher won a wave of support for denouncing the scenes, Callaghan faced a vote of no confidence.

That will spark fears that rising prices will leave families behind as public sector wages are frozen and benefits are cut. It could also squeeze Bank of England interest rates, which have been rock-bottom for so long that much of the mortgage market is dependent on them staying that way.Meanwhile, a lorry driver shortage blamed on Brexit immigration rules has led the Government to slash legal requirements to become an HGV driver.Industry chiefs fear the issues could affect the supply of toys, turkeys and more over the Christmas season.

Black Labrador Bonnie was left in searing pain when a spider - thought to be a  widow or similar - sank its fangs into her face while she was out on a walk. The -month-old pup was rushed for emergency treatment in Gateshead after her eye became so swollen it closed shut. Owners Lisa and Nick Bennett, who were visiting family, were terried that Bonnieaposs throat and windpipe might close up from the reaction.They searched online for urgent animal treatment and found Vets Now emergency clinic in Gateshead - where they took the increasingly distressed pooch, Chronicle Live reports. Bonnie also experienced vomiting and diarrhoea on her way. Attendant vet Konrad ran tests and concluded Bonnie had been bitten by a spider, and hooked her up to a drip. The bite happened five days previously while the couple were walking their pet near Redditch in Worcestershire. Konrad gave Bonnie an injection, put her under observation, and waited for the swelling to go down. Bonnieaposs condition improved quickly after the treatment and she was soon well enough to be reunited with her relieved family. Lisa said: “It was a terrible shock to see her face swell up and it happened so quickly. “Being so far from home made it even worse — you just feel so vulnerable when your pet is in distress. “Bonnie is a very intelligent dog and she was clearly aware that something was wrong. “She kept trying to use her paw to wipe and scratch away the swelling, which made it more upsetting to see. “We assumed it was a reaction to something she’d eaten or possibly a snake bite, but it never occurred to us she’d been bitten by a spider. “Konrad and the team at Vets Now said it can be several days before a spider bite starts affecting a dog — and that’s when we realised. “Five days before all this drama happened, we’d been walking Bonnie and our other black lab Benson near our house when she gave a yelp and came limping back to us. “We checked her over, couldn’t see anything untoward and just assumed she’d maybe stood on a thorn. “Then she went off again and seemed totally fine. “But what we know now is that the yelp was almost certainly a sign she’d been bitten.”Senior vet nurse Ashley Wemple said it’s very rare for pets to be bitten by spiders.She added: “This is not the type of case we see every day. Butyour dog gets bitten by an insect or even a snake, it can be dficult to see any evidence because the bite is often covered by their fur. “Symptoms can include swelling, itchiness and irritation of the skin and, in severe cases, an allergic reaction. “It can take hours — or, as in Bonnie’s case, days — for this to happen. “Butthere is a bad reaction or swelling then time really is of the essence, and you should seek help straight away. “Nick and Lisa did the right thing calling us when they did —they had delayed, the consequences could have been very serious. “Bonnie was such a friendly and good-natured dog. We were all delighted to see her go back to Lisa and Nick after treatment with her tail wagging.” After three days there was no longer any trace of swelling on Bonnieaposs face - and she made a full recovery. Lisa said: “The service we got was brilliant from the moment we rang — and Konrad and his colleagues were so incredibly kind and patient, not just with Bonnie but with us as well. We’re really grateful to them for looking after her, and us, so well.” Comment MORE ON AnimalsSpidersFalse widow spidersBig DogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But experts have revealed you should actually be waiting another month, when the clocks go back and the winter season really starts kicking in. As turning on your heating is a sure sign that winter has arrived central heating experts at PlumbNation have said you shouldnapost be switching it on any earlier than October . Expert Jordan Chance said: Turning on your central heating is notably one of the sure signs that winter has arrived.Although there is no single temperature at which you should turn your heating on, many aim for the time when clocks go back, falling this year on October st, he told the Daily Echo.  “There are, however, a series of ways to delay putting your heating on, keeping you warmer for longer and saving you those extra pennies. Using a draught excluder is one of the quickest and cheapest ways to keep your home warm, preventing cold air from entering and warm air from leaving under your doors.What do you think of this   Let us know in the comments below “Keeping your curtains closed, or investing in a thermal curtain lining can likewise help to prevent warm air from escaping - this trick alone can reduce heat loss by up to %. Whilst a favourite saying of parents is to ‘put a jumper on’, this old age argument can certainly keep you warmer for longer, and save the big switch on for a later date. It is also important to note that leaving your heating on low all day does not reduce your heating bills. Having the heating on only as and when you need it, is the best way to save energy. Using a thermostat with a timer offers a simple and speedy solution to controlling your heating effectively.” Top  tips to help you save money on heating . Upgrade Your Thermostat Your thermostat controls your home’s temperature by communicating with your boiler. Thermostats, particularly in older homes with older heating systems, can degrade over time. Such degradation can lead to delays in your boiler switching on, or your home being heated at much higher temperatures than required. Upgrading your thermostat could provide for greater accuracy in thermostat to boiler communication, preventing energy from being wasted, and saving you money. . Stop Draughts!  Stopping heat from escaping through unwanted gaps is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy and money. To draught-proof your home, you need to primarily identy the ‘problem areas’ where draughts are causing issues, these could include doors, windows, chimneys and floorboards. You can block unwanted gaps by using draught-proofing strips around your windows and doors, or flexible silicone-based filler to fill the gaps in your floorboards. . Add an Extra LayerInstead of heating your home to be warm enough to walk around in shorts and a t-shirt, why not turn your thermostat down and put on a jumper  Adding clothing layers will insulate your body and make it easier to regulate your body’s temperature. The more layers you wear, the less the heating will need to be on, reducing your heating bills. . Introduce Soft Furnishings Soft furnishings, such as curtains and rugs, can make all the dference in saving money on your heating. If you have a carpeted home then it will naturally help to boost insulation however,you have hard flooring investing in some good quality materials, such as a plush rug, will help to prevent heat from being lost. . Turn Your Thermostat Down By °C  An excessive heating bill can be easily rectied with the ‘step-down’ challenge. By turning your heating down by just °C, you can save up to % on your heating bill. The typical heating range is between - °C - so why don’t you see how low you can go  It is also important to avoid classic thermostat ‘faux pas’. Contrary to popular belief, turning up your thermostat does not heat up your room quicker. This method will only send your energy bills skyrocketing. . Clean Your Radiators If your radiators aren’t in your weekly cleaning routine, then it’s time to add them. A buildup of dust can affect your health, allergies and your heating bill. Layers of dust in your radiator can prevent heat from escaping effectively, meaning your radiators will have to work harder to warm your room. . Don’t Dry Your Clothes On Your Radiator We would recommend that you stop using your radiators to dry your clothes. The clothes that you place over the top of your radiators prevent the heat from escaping and heating your room, meaning that your boiler has to pick up the slack and work at a greater rate - increasing costs. Similarly, the increase in the air’s moisture can create condensation, leading to potential issues with mould and dampness. . Check Your Radiator Cover If you have a radiator cover make sure to check that it is a good conductor of heat. Radiator covers made from materials such as wood are poor conductors and can prevent heat from being dispersed effectively - wasting energy and money. If your radiator cover has a solid top then you may be losing even more heat, as it will be absorbed by the top of the cover. . Bleed Your Radiators Bleeding your radiator is essential in preventing the efficiency of your radiator from decreasing, as a result of air entering your heating system. The quickest way to checkair has entered your heating system is to turn your central heating on and feel your radiator. If the radiator is warm at the bottom but cold at the top this is generally a sign that air is present. . Get Your Boiler Serviced If your boiler is ageing and has seen better days, there’s a strong chance it won’t be working as efficiently as it once was. Defective boilers can increase your heating bill massively as they will need to work signicantly harder to bring your home up to the desired temperature. We recommend that you get your boiler serviced every  months , to ensure that your boiler is running efficiently and safely.

Stephen Williams put up the ft-high picket fence to block off a path and a layby used by customers going into the chippy next door. The -year-old used to run a sweet shop next to Victoria House Fish and Chips, which he was forced to close in . He has held onto the property and has now transformed the building into a house. The old shop front is being turned into a living room but customers are furious, saying pedestrians must now walk on the road to get to the chip shop. Thereaposs a layby outside the chippy which people use to park before picking up their food,” one customer said.  The chip shop has been there for years. Whoever bought the house next door must have known that. Sticking a fence up is very petty.” The customer went on to say it was “unbelievable” that Williams wants privacy now, after benefiting from people walking on the path when they were coming into his shop and “lining his pockets”. Mr Williams built the fence along the original boundary line of his £, semi-detached property in Alnwick, Northumberland, which extends ft onto the layby. A nearby resident said that while they didn’t agree with the fence, they had some sympathy for Williams.  Stephen is sick and tired of people eating their chips right outside his home,” they said. Sometimes schoolkids queue outside and can go right outside his living room window. They are basically sitting on his windowsill stuffing their faces while heaposs watching TV. Council chiefs are now investigatingMr Williamsapos fence is legal. Cllr Gordon Castle, Alnwick ward member for Northumberland County Council, said he had raised it with officers at County Hall to the highest level. He [Mr Williams] claims to have deeds showing ownership of where his fence now sits,” Cllr Castle said. I can hardly believe he has gone ahead with this before any resolution with county highways, especially given the impact on pedestrians and children walking to school. There are meetings scheduled to find the legal way forward and Iaposm sorry I canapost do more, but Iaposve sent photos and explained to officers that Iaposm receiving many messages of complaint. I canapost get it higher or faster at County Hall, but I wonapost let it go. Mr Williams defended the fence, saying he wanted privacy now that the shop had been turned into a house and the front room had become his living room. This means the window faces straight onto the path which is used by people queuing to get fish and chips,” he said. Weaposve had people eating their chips on our windowsill and looking through the window while we are trying to relax. Itaposs not on. We just want some privacy. The land is rightfully ours. We checked with the plans and we are legally entitled to put a fence up. Most people wouldnapost want people using their land as a footpath and neither do we. We just want to protect our property.

They also attract more spiders into our homes.There are plenty of products to help tackle flies in the home, but they usually damage the environment. Fly tape is wrapped in useless packaging and is a common hazard for pets who get it caught in their fur. While fly spray may seem like the go-to option, itaposs well known for containing toxins - a hazard for not only our pets but for plants and humans too. Here are five ways of banishing fruit flies from your home - without causing unnecessary damage to your home or the environment. . Homemade fly tape  While store bought fly tape may seem like an easy and effective option, itaposs packaged in unnecessary plastic and cardboard. You can make your own version at home with simple materials. Thick Paper cut into inch wide strips can be used for the tape - opt to reuse old packaging that would otherwise be thrown away. To make your sticky coating, mix honey, sugar, and warm water until it forms a gloopy solution. Submerge the pre-cut strips in the mixture, and leave these to dry. Lastly, attach string to the top of each and hang around the house as needed. . Wine trap  If you have leftover wine hanging around which has gone bad, you can use this to trap pesky flies. All you need to do is leave an almost empty wine bottle open in the affected room. Fruit flies are attracted to alcohol, they will simply fly in and be unable to escape up the neck of the bottle. Don’t have wine  Don’t worry. Other alcohol such as beer works just as well. Just make sure your chosen beverage is in a funnel neck bottle. Alternatively, you can pour the liquid into a bowl, cover and add holes . Apple cider vinegar trap  The sweetness of the apple cider vinegar lures in fruit flies in the same way wine does. To create your trap, fill a container with vinegar but add in a few drops of dish soap - and place in the infested area. The soap works to break the surface tension of the vinegar, leaving the flies to drown and sink to the bottom. As a result, you don’t need to use any cling film or other single use plastics for this option. . Old fruit  If you have old fruit lying around, this could be the source of your infestation. But, you can use pieces of it to trap and eradicate the flies. Once you have some chunks of overripe fruit, put them in the bottom of a glass jar and add a little vinegar for added effectiveness. Lastly, take some paper and roll this into a cone, put it in the top of the jar to create a funnel. The rotting fruit will attract the fruit flies, but the cone means they will be unable to escape. . Use essential oils  There are some scents which fruit flies hate, and which can be utilised to keep them out of your home. Basil, lemongrass, peppermint, and lavender are all well known to deter fruit flies. Try placing basil plants around the home to deter the insects - you can then cook with them to ensure zero waste. Alternatively try the other scents as essential oils either in a burner or spray form, they’ll keep fruit flies away and leave your home smelling fresh.According to waste collection company Skips and Bins, itaposs easier to prevent the infestation than to get rid of one.Methods to keep the bugs at bay include planning consumption of fresh fruit and veg to ensure pieces of rotten fruit donapost become a beacon to the pests. Managing Director, Scott Hawthorne, said: “It’s worth pointing out that preventing fruit flies is often much easier than getting rid of them. Fruit flies often appear when there is rotting produce in our homes. To avoid this happening try to plan ahead and only buy as much fresh produce as you need, eliminating the chance for any forgotten fruit and vegetables to rot in your kitchen. It’s important to monitor your cupboards and fridge to catch food before it goes bad. There’s plenty of optionsyou have excess fruit and vegetables. Try turning these into soups, cakes, ice lollies or freezing where possible to avoid wastage. If all  fails, try keeping fruit in the fridge rather than uncovered on a counter, regularly clean drains and bins, and wash dishcloths often.” Comment MORE ON AppleAlcoholFood poisoningAnimalsSalmonellaInsects\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And now the genius tot has impressed yet again by learning how to count up to  in Japanese in less than  hours. Proud mum Jazelle, , from South West London, tells the Mirror Isaiah has been able to grasp new information extraordinarily easily from the age of five months. The early years teacher explains: “One day Isaiah was watching a phonic video on my phone on YouTube, he scrolled to the videos at the bottom and clicked on a Japanese numeracy video. “He listened to it once and was fixated. He asked to watch it again, then before I knew it he would recite the numbers back to back. “I knew then he was keen on languages, so I showed him a video in Spanish. His eyes lit up, so I decided to buy him Spanish flashcards he absolutely loved these and would study them every day. “He loves that Japanese has a pattern. Once you learn numbers -, it’s very easy to learn the rest. Japanese numbers follow a logical pattern, with a few exceptions. “So, it’s a continuous repeat of the same word for dferent numbers. For example, number  is ‘ichi’ and number  is ‘juu’….. therefore, number  would be juu-ichi. “Because plus is . Simply place the  words together and you’ll have . There’s only a few exceptions. It’s so cool once you get the hang of it!” When Isaiah was just four-months old, Jazelle turned her living room into a numeracy and literacy environment so that Isaiah could benefit visually. When Isaiah was eight-months-old, Jazelle would ask him questions, ‘whereaposs the letter H  Or S  - then incredibly, Isaiah would point out the correct letters. Weeks after he would sound them out using phonics. Jazelle said: “I was first taken back and thought, did my eight-month-old just call out letters  I remember just laughing nervously but I was so excited and wanted to hear it again. “I thought maybe it sounded like he said the numbers and letters but he actually said something . But he continued to say it which confirmed what I thought. “I remember telling his dad when he got home from work I took Isaiah to the wall where the letter and number stickers were, when he called them out we both stood there just laughing. “We were first time parents and just felt so proud and excited.” The mum said she did think it was unusual but admitted she was overjoyed more than anything  - and noticed that her son was also excited. She added Isaiah enjoys having numbers in front of him and loves practising alone he has white boards, and pens to practise writing numbers every day. Jazelle said: “When I realised he was identying numbers and letters I bought him a pack of sight words. I actually placed them in a drawer and thought he wouldnapost be interested.  “But I started reading them to him, incorporating the phonics, and he showed interest in this and would flick through them “A while after this I thought to see how much he remembered, so I flashed a card and said “what does this say ”, to my surprise he got each one correct! “With multiplication, he would write numbers - on his board, he’d skip count by s, simply by missing out a number. This was and still is his favourite activity to do.” She added: “I recall one of his nursery teachers telling me that he sat with his friends and helped them learn their numbers. “She said his friends werenapost so confident, so Isaiah sat with them and would point out the numbers, asking them to repeat what he was saying. “She said how sweet it was to see, and how much he wanted everyone to learn with him. It was a moment I won’t forget. He was just over two at the time.” After turning one, Isaiah would air write letters before getting a doodle pad which he then wrote numbers on.Other parents didnapost believe Isaiah’s capabilities, so Jazelle began to document his learning through footage and share it on her popular Instagram page.Jazelle said you only have to see her son’s face when he is around numbers to realise that’s when he is at his happiest. The mum said: “I have had an amazing response from people. I’d say % of people have rooted for him and praised him along the way. “Some ask for tips and some just say how they find him amazing. However, I received a handful of people saying, ‘he’s just a kid, let him play, he shouldn’t be learning like this. “But what they don’t understand is, Isaiah wakes up and WANTS to learn. All of what you see is all child led. “He loves to ask so many questions and is so loving. He’s also very head strong and passionate about learning. It blows my mind because he is only two-years-old. “I have never had experience with a child like him, and I’m saying that with over  years experience in early years education. “We are currently on the hunt for an educational psychologist to assess Isaiah as we believe he is a child of high potential and upon research, could be gted. “It’s frustrating to know that some think I’m a pushy parent, but that can’t be further from the truth. Isaiah is unique, he finds learning extremely exciting, and perceives it as play. “He is happy and that’s all that matters to me!”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.Comment MORE ON Parenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thousands of people Brits are reporting symptoms that could be easily mistaken for Covid. Negative results show they are suffering instead with a harmless but nasty common cold infection.Dr Philippa Kaye, a GP at a London practice, told BBC Newsbeat : Weaposve actually been seeing a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections.We are mixing in a way that we havenapost been mixing over the past  months. The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school. New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test. Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse.Dr Ron Eccles, Emeritus Professor at Cardf Universityaposs School of Biosciences told Patient.info : If youaposve been exposed to a particular virus before, you may not develop any symptoms at all, because your immune system has been primed to fight off the infection.Itaposs the same process that means you usually only catch chickenpox once. With common colds we generally donapost have such a strong immune response and therefore we probably donapost get lelong immunity to a particular virus, he adds. However, we may get a milder responsewe are exposed to that virus again. The NHSaposs big three symptoms for Covid are a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. If you experience any of these symptoms then get a PCR test and self-isolate until you get your test result.

The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor.

After an audience member, also a retail manager, asked about time off over the festive period he confirmed the food retailer was planning on giving its staff the day off.

During the exchange a member of the public said: We have been talking a lot about the delivery issues, Iaposm a store manager in retail and have been for a number of years and itaposs incredibly dficult at the moment.  Last Christmas was really challenging with the lockdowns, everything closing. This year already we are facing dficulties getting products on the shelves.

Over time, the young girl struck up a friendship with the petaposs -year-old owner, Keith, who began giving her lts to school and lavishing her with gts. With a dad who walked out on her while still young and a mum who worked around the clock to make ends meet, Jenny spent a lot of time alone and was grateful to know a friendly face. Aged , however, Keith started asking for sexual favours. It marked the beginning of a horric journey that saw the vulnerable teenager sold as a sex slave to forceful and violent men - and plied with booze and drugs. I realised it was wrong when he started to say Iaposve done this for you, what are you going to do for me  I said I didnapost want to, Jenny says now of her neighbouraposs sick abuse. He said it would only take a couple of seconds and I was special to him - and thathe was special to me and I appreciated what he did Iaposd have sex. I think from the first time thataposs when he felt he owned you or made his mark on you. Perv neighbour invited men to abuse young girl Horrendously abused for years, Jenny eventually reached out for help and called The Salvation Army, whose workers took her to a safe house within two hours and gave her invaluable support. Now, she is speaking out about her experience ahead of a skye with another survivor of modern slavery to raise money for the charitable organisation. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersI got to know Keith when I went to primary school, she explains in a video. I was in Year Six, and he had a dog so on the way to school youaposd pet the dog. He was always around so it was just a good morning and a friendly face. It was just nice to have someone so interested. Heaposd invite you in the house for a drink and heaposd put his hand on your knee and it was uncomfortable, but it sort of progressed from there. Jenny explains she was afraid to tell her family about the abuse, and over time Keith demanded more and more aposfavoursapos.  One day, he told her he was in debt to other men, whom he began inviting over to his house to join in the vile abuse. Theyaposd offer you weed, theyaposd offer you drugs, theyaposd offer you alcohol, and they were a lot more forceful and violent, says Jenny. Theyaposd pass you around. The men would then bring their friends in and then the network got bigger. aposTrafficking steals your identityapos Addicted to the drug diazepam, Jenny left home aged  and stayed at a womenaposs refuge. However, after years of emotional abuse, she struggled to tear herself free from her tormentors.  I kept going back, she says. You can try and run away but trafficking almost steals your identity. So you become what theyaposve made you become. Thataposs all you feel worth so you go back because thataposs the only thing giving you purpose. Thankfully, after being put in touch with Victim Support by the police, she was told to ring The Salvation Army. The group provides specialist support for adult victims of modern slavery in England and Wales, working with a network of partners running safe houses and outreach support. If it wasnapost for that phone call, andit wasnapost for The Salvation Army, I wouldaposve been dead by now, says Jenny. They didnapost ask questions, they didnapost judge you, they didnapost put any pressure on you. You just felt free and safe.Have you been a victim of modern slavery and want to share your story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcJenny and Dan*, a fellow modern slavery survivor, are planning their jump on Sunday,  October, the day before Anti-Slavery Day – which aims to raise awareness of the plight of slavery survivors and the warning signs people can look out for. They hope their skye will encourage others to sign up to take the leap for The Salvation Army so that more funds can be raised to help support the organisation’s work. Forced to sell drugs by aposthreateningapos bosses Dan was support by the organisation after bosses at a warehouse he was working at began forcing him to sell drugs - threatening his family and refusing to pay him for his long shts. When the police raided the warehouse, they realised he was a victim and took him to a safe house where The Salvation Army and its partners helped him to recover from his ordeal. Speaking about the groupaposs support, Dan says: “I was always treated with respect, honesty and integrity. I learned so much - from cooking skills to languages and other cultures - and their positive energy would instantly cheer me up whenever I felt down. They also helped me apply for work and my confidence grew under their care. Amazing people who deserve recognition. What an amazing service. I will forever be in their debt.”Kathy Betteridge, director of anti-trafficking and modern slavery for The Salvation Army, says: “We are so grateful to Jenny and Dan and in awe of their bravery in skying to raise vital funds for our work with modern slavery survivors.“Please do donate to support their jump via their Just Giving link, but you could consider taking the leap yourself to raise funds for The Salvation Army so that we can continue to help people who have gone through unimaginable experiences on their journey of recovery.” *Names have been changed To donate to the work of The Salvation Army support with modern slavery survivors and support Jenny and Dan in their skye click here.

Presenting duo Ant and Dec have left people making all kinds of attempts to pronounce another location after snapping a photo on their way to the I’m a Celeb filming spot.The pair once struggled to pronounce Gwrych Castle, which is near Abergele, where the show was filmed last year, Chill reports.And en route to the venue where the show will be filmed for , the presenters stopped off at Mynyddislwyn, which left UK fans pondering the correct pronunciation. Even Ant and Dec looked baffled - but that may be because they were  miles out of their way after taking a wrong turn at Newport.  So here’s all you - and Ant and Dec - need to know about Mynyddislwyn and how to pronounce it like a local with a quick Welsh lesson.How do you say it Don’t stumble at the first hurdle - the ‘y’ in the first part of the word. It’s pronounced like aposughapos. aposDdapos in Welsh is classed as its own letter and is pronounced aposthapos. Another confusion comes with aposwyapos that makes an aposooapos. But let’s make it easy for you - put it all together and you get mun-ith-is-loo-in.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep. Visit our brilliant new website chill and start packing. If youaposd also like weekly inspiration and advice for your next trip, you can sign up to the Chill newsletter here. For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.What does it mean anyway Mynydd means mountain in Welsh and the parish is often translated as aposmountain ashapos or aposmountain below the groveapos. There is actually a place called Mountain Ash not too far away, so donapost get them mixed up.Where is it exactly Mynyddislwyn is a small parish between Ystrad Mynach and Crumlin and while technically in Monmouthshire, itaposs more aligned to Caerphilly. So people there claim it as theirs, whatever the internet might say.And what about Gwrych Castle  Any help on how to say that According to researcher at Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, Rhŷn Williams, the impressive Welsh castle is in fact pronounced, Goo-rreech. He said the stress on the aposWapos part is paramount. *That’s ‘welcome back’ in Welsh!

As well as meeting Emma, Kate also chatted with fellow British US Open champions Joe Salisbury, who won the menaposs doubles title with American Rajeev Ram, and Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett, the menaposs wheelchair doubles champions. There was an awkward moment when Kate first arrived as she was unsure how to congratulate the group.She said: Are we shaking hands  I donapost want to break your training bubbles.Itaposs really awkward, you donapost know quite whether to do it. It is the same with face masks.You never know whether to hug people, congratulate them or shake hands. But amazing, guys honestly, congratulations.Emma, who is now ranked nd in the world, became the first qualier to win one of the four majors when she claimed the US Open womenaposs singles title earlier this month. She also became the first British woman in  years to win a Grand Slam title, when she breezed past Canadian Leylah Fernandez in straight sets.After her victory, Kate took to Twitter to send a rare personal tweet saying : Huge congratulations @EmmaRaducanu on your stunning performances and historic Grand Slam victory! Incredible –we are all so proud of you. @leylahfernandez well done on your amazing achievements at this year’s #USOpen, it’s been a pleasure to watch. CThe Queen also said it was a remarkable achievement at such a young age and added she was an inspiration for future tennis players. In a personal message to Emma, she said: I send my congratulations to you on your success in winning the United States Open Tennis Championships. It is a remarkable achievement at such a young age, and is testament to your hard work and dedication. I have no doubt your outstanding performance, and that of your opponent Leylah Fernandez, will inspire the next generation of tennis players. Raducanu shot into the spotlight with a surprise y run to the second week of Wimbledon - her Grand Slam debut tournament earlier this summer. And even before the tournament, it appears that Kate and husband Prince William were fans of the young Brit. In a tweet from July, the couple made their predictions of who would win Wimbledon and said: Unbiased prediction to win it: @andy_murray and @EmmaRaducanu #Wimbledon.

But it seems that taking part in the famous long-distance run in the English capital is one sporting event that she wonapost be taking part in, evenshe wanted to. Journalist Bryony Gordon, who has met Kate and completed the marathon, revealed she asked hershe would consider doing it. But Bryony told Runneraposs World : I can’t remember exactly what happened, but I was like, ‘Are you going to run the marathon ’And she was like, ‘Oh I can’t because security is a bit dficult.’ But I was like, ‘Sure, yeah, yeah, good excuse. If I can do it, anyone can.apos Despite not being able to take part, Kate did attend the  London Marathon when her mental health cause Heads Together was one of the main charities for that year - although she didnapost so any running.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . Earlier this week, Kate got to show off her sporting prowess once again during an engagement with young air cadets in the Lake District.She was pictured mountain biking and abseiling - and tried her best at encouraging one reluctant youngster to take the plunge. Itelouwa Odipe, , from Lancaster, said he spoke to Kate as she waited to try abseiling. He said: She was about to abseil and I was next in line so she asked meI wanted to go before her. I was a bit scared so I said no. She saidI did she would meet me down there. The teenager spoke to her again after deciding not to brave the drop. She said it was really good and I should try it, he said. I think she was very kind. Even though she is a royal highness she still does things normal humans do.

There has been speculation that the couple could travel to the UK for Christmas and bring their children with them.Since moving to Calornia last year, Harry has only ed to the UK twice, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs newborn daughter Lilibet has not been to the UK after being born in Calornia in June and is yet to meet her great-grandmother the Queen or her grandfather Prince Charles.Earlier this year, it was announced that Harry would be releasing a tell-all memoir about his le that would be released next year.And royal author Angela Levin, who has written a biography of Harry in the past, told True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat of a Christmas visit: I think it would cause a lot of people a lot of grief.The Queen would be delighted because she adores Harry - and also you love a child even though you disagree with everything they are doing - but I think for the other Royals, it is quite a stf time where everybody has a very explicit diary of changing five times a day and what they have to do at what time. I think it will be very, very dficultthey come over because the feeling is you can’t trust them, and they might use this for their next documentary or for his next book.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Experts have warned of a crossover of symptoms for the past  months, making it dficult to tell the dference between the two illnesses. Symptoms of the virus are extremely similar to those of a regular cold, particularly for those who have been double jabbed.Vaccinated people who contract the virus are likely to experience a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, the Daily Record reported. But now, new research from the ZOE Covid Symptom study, developed by Kingaposs College London, has found that thereaposs one symptom that can help tell the dference.Data shows that loss of smellor loss of taste is still one of the most important predictors of testing positive for coronavirus rather than a regular cold.Researchers say you can check your sense of smell easily at home by snfing scented foods or products, or noticing whether familiar foods start to lose their flavour or taste strange. Millions of people have been logging their symptoms, tests and vaccines on the UK ZOE COVID Symptom Study app since it was launched. Thanks to health reports, scientists now know there are more than  symptoms of Covid-, including headache, runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. Common Covid symptoms in people fully vaccinated Data as of September : Runny nose Headache Sneezing Sore throat Loss of smellCommon COVID- symptomsyou’re unvaccinated Headache Runny Nose Sore Throat Fever Persistent cough Loss of smellcomes further down the list for unvaccinated people, but it’s still an important predictor of having COVID- rather than a regular cold.

Sinead Richards, , was the picture of happiness when she tied the knot with her partner of  years, Liam McDonagh, , on August . But she passed away on September , just over a year after tests revealed she had stage four breast cancer, which had spread through her body. She visited doctors in early  but they initially missed the tumour, believing the mum-of-two was too young to have breast cancer. Heartbroken Liam said of their wedding: “Everyone was smiling all day. She was very unwell but it really showed what she was like, she battled to get there and put on a brave face. It was mind over matter. She got herself there and that is all she wanted. It has had a huge impact on our lives. She was amazing, she was such a lovely person. Nobody she ever met had a bad word to say about her, everyone loved her. It is just so tragic. When we were in the hospital, people would give us a second glance as they couldnapost believe how young we were. She was only , we couldnapost believe it.” Mum-of-two Sinead, a pastoral mentor, found a lump on her breast in late  but put off visiting the doctors for two months as she did not think it would be cancer.  When she visited the doctors in early , nothing was initially discovered and Sinead was believed to be too young to suffer from breast cancer. But Liam urged Sinead toto the surgery and tests revealed she had advanced Stage Four breast cancer which had spread all over her body. Tragically, Sinead died on September , less than a month after their wedding, leaving behind Liam and their two daughters, Paige, seven, and Georgie, . Just one in four women survive for more than five years after they are diagnosed with the illness. Now Liam, a builder, has urged other women to get tested despite their age.  He added: If her story helps even one more person to get checked, this will have all been worthwhile. She was the most amazing person. I just want to show that this can happen to anyone and urge people to get checkedthey ever notice anything.A fundraiser has been launched on GoFundMe to support the family and help with costs of a funeral which will take place on October .A fun day at a local pub and a canal ride from Leeds to Liverpool have been organised in the fundraising drive – and more than £, has been raised so far.

John was joined by other pensioners who want to play the beautul gameJohn Shannons dad John Sr was there so see his son make his England debut Image: Julian Hamilton Daily MirrorByMartin Fricker:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsAt , John Shannon had his dream come true when he made his debut for England’s first over-s side in a - win against Wales – cheered on by his -year-old father. Having first proudly watched his lad from the touchline seven decades ago, John Senior was there again yesterday to see him make history. The Arsenal-supporting Second World War veteran said: “It was a fantastic game, they played some wonderful stuff. I do enjoy being on the side watching him play. “It makes me very proud to see my son playing for England.” West Ham fan John Junior, who was the oldest of the  England and Wales players in the inaugural NHS Challenge Trophy, said: “Everyone always asks after Dad, askinghe will be at the next game.  “He’s given me criticism over the years for other things in le but never criticises my footballing abilities. “I love playing matches. The standard is just as good as other age groups, albeit maybe a bit slower.” John Snr of Harrogate, North Yorks, who spent three years behind enemy lines in Belgium during the war, first watched his son play in school matches in the s, before the youngster switched to athletics. He began watching him again in his s, when John Jr, from Cambridge, was playing over-s football, and was named the FA’s Supporter of the Year in , at the age of . England’s player-manager Ken Pollock, , said: “The Shannons epitomise everything about what we stand for as a national team and as a sport. They’re father and son, aged  and , watching and playing. “There’s no finer testament to the benefits of our game than can be found in their match-day attendance.”  Although over-s have played walking football internationals, this was the first game with normal rules for England and Wales. The indoor game, at England’s St George’s Park headquarters in Burton, Staffs, was sanctioned by the FA. Unlike walking football it was played at speed with fierce tackles and crunching challenges – though ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher made sure things did not get too heated between the fierce rivals. The game was arranged to promote exercise for the over-s. Ken added: “The pandemic has shown the importance of physical fitness. Statistically, exercise has been a preventative and curative agent for older people. To mark this, we called the cup The NHS Challenge Trophy, to reflect our gratitude for their work over the last  months.” The over-s side evolved from earlier over-s and over-s teams, which began competing in . Newcomers from across England took part in trials before being selected for the Three Lions.  Ken, from Pevensey Bay, Dorset, is the oldest player in his Sunday non-league side Grove Grovellers. And he loved lining up alongside players of his own age to represent his country. He told the Mirror: “The game isn’t much dferent in my s to what it was like in my younger years. The tackles still fly in, there is still the same competitiveness. “It’s still the same injuries, the hamstrings and the calf tears. It’s actually easier to play longer now-adays. Injuries can be diagnosed earlier and treatment is better.” Other players in yesterday’s game included Everton fan Mike Unwin, , a retired primary school head from West Kirby, Merseyside. Holly Murdoch, general manager at St George’s Park, said: “We hope this inspires the older generation to dust off their boots and get playing again.” England won the game -. John Snr, who lives in Harrogate, North Yorks, spent three years behind enemy lines in Belgium during World War II.  His son made his England debut aged , something John Snr described as his “proudest moment” as a parent. John Snr was crowned the FA’s ‘Supporter of the Year’ in , when aged , for his devotion to football. He first started watching his son play matches for his school in the s, before the youngster switched to athletics. John Snr only began watching him again when he was in his s, by which time John Jnr was playing over-s football. The Arsenal fan told the Mirror after yesterday’s match: “It was a fantastic game, they played some wonderful stuff.  “I do enjoy being on the side watching him play. It makes me very proud to see my son playing for England.” West Ham-supporting John Jnr, from Cambridge, added: “Everyone always asks after dad, askinghe will be at the next game. “He’s given me criticism over the years for other things in le but never criticises my footballing abilities. “I love playing matches.

The UK has been plagued by a number of shortages in recent weeks, brought on by a shortage of HGV drivers.BPaposs head of UK retail Hanna Hofer has said it is important the government understands the urgency of the situation, which she described as bad, very bad, ITV News reports.She added that BP had two-thirds of normal forecourt stock levels required for smooth operations and the level is declining rapidly. Here we take a look at which oil companies have faced petrol station closures, and the reason for the fuel shortage. Which petrol stations have closed   BP and Tesco have closed some petrol stations because of petrol and diesel supply issues, brought on by the lack of HGV drivers. There are around , BPO branded filling stations around the country, of which  are operated by BP themselves, and the oil giant has said a handful of these have been forced to close. The oil giant, which is the largest operator of petrol stations in the UK, has not said which specic ones have closed.  The Mirror reached out to BP, but the company could not confirm which specic petrol stations were closed due to the fast-changing situation. BP said in a statement: “We are experiencing some fuel supply issues at some of our retail sites in the UK and unfortunately have therefore seen a handful of sites temporarily close due to a lack of both unleaded and diesel grades. These have been caused by some delays in the supply chain which has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK and there are many actions being taken to address the issue. We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise any future disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries to serve our customers.  They are currently working to address the problem, and prioritising deliveries to motorway service areas, major trunk roads and sites with the largest demands. The company said: We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries. Esso, which owns  Tesco Alliance sites, has reported similar issues with a small number of them. A spokesperson said: We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. “We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience.” Currently these are the only two suppliers reporting shortages. Supermarket Morrisons has said itaposs not seeing similar issues with any of its  petrol stations, according to the BBC. Similarly, Co-Op, which operates  petrol stations, has a full complement of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco says it has a good availability of fuel, and the BBC report that both Sainsburyaposs and Asda have had no issues in fuel supplies. Why is there a fuel shortage   Is panic-buying understandable - or selfish  Let us know in the comments below Similarly to the food shortage which is causing empty supermarket shelves, the reason for the fuel shortage is to do disruption to the supply chain. This is due to a post-Brexit shortage in the number of HGV drivers. Since the UK left the European Union, many non-UK nationals who drive trucks have opted to work solely within EU countries. This has left logistics firms struggling to find workers. According to The Road Haulage Association , Britain needs as many as , more drivers to keep shops stocked and supplies moving.The coronavirus situation has made everything worse, with the closure of test centres worsening the shortage of drivers.The Department for Transport has recently changed the rules for tests to speed up the process of qualication.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BPExxon Mobil CorporationEuropean Union\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sailing Kate has a deep love of sailing and showed off her skills in  at the King’s Cup regatta off the Isle of Wight - although she was beaten to the finish line by William. Itaposs no surprise that sheaposs also struck up a friendship with Olympics sailing hero Sir Ben Ainslie, whoaposs even taken her out on the water. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersThis summer, the Cambridges are said to have made the most of the fleeting sunshine by taking a boat around the Norfolk coast.A local source told Vanity Fairaposs Katie Nicholl that they are very much a family of sailors now after getting the kids up to speed while staying at their holiday home Anmer Hall in early August.“Kate has always been a competent sailor and William’s pretty good too, said the source. Volleyball Donning a pair of five-inch wedges, perhaps Kate was looking for a height advantage when she tried her hand at volleyball. In her first solo engagement since the birth of Prince George, the royal joined young athletes and their parents in education workshops for her charity SportsAid in  - but wasnapost quite dressed for the part in her skinny jeans. The Russell and Bromley heels didnapost stop her at the volleyball net but she did tell one young fencer: Iaposd like to give it a go but Iaposve brought the wrong shoes. She chatted to aspiring athletes and watched them play badminton, volleyball, fencing and wheelchair basketball before posing for a photo with the group. Kate was joined at Londonaposs Olympic Park Copper Box by rower Katherine Grainger and wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan as they tutored the next generation of Britainaposs athletes. Hockey Hockey is one of Kateaposs first sporting loves. Sheaposs very good too, having captained her team as a schoolgirl at Marlborough College. Back in , the duchess swapped her skirt suit and heels for a tracksuit top and trainers to join Great Britain’s women’s Olympic hockey team.  And she even grabbed a hockey stick and joined in the practice session herself during her visit to the London  Olympic Park. The dressed-down royal ditched her trademark LK Bennett heels for comfortable trainers as she ran around the pitch at the Riverside Arena in bright coloured skinny jeans .The Duchess’s visit boosted the team, and some took to Twitter to share their excitement.England and GB hockey player Kate Walsh wrote: “A real pleasure and an honour to meet and play hockey with HRH the Duchess of Cambridge this morning!  “Think our team have got Royal approval!” Hannah Macleod praised Kate’s sporting skills, adding: “A pleasure and an honour to meet HRH the Duchess of Cambridge this morning at the Olympic Park. “Sheaposs quite handy at hockey too!” Table tennis As a spectator, Kate can often be spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon watching stars like Andy Murray. A patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, sheaposs also partial to the slightly less sophisticated game of ping pong too.  After sister Pippa boasted about her familyaposs skills back in , the duchess displayed the ‘Middleton competitiveness’ when she took on William during their Scotland visit. Onlookers agreed mum-to-be Kate was the better player as the royal couple had a knockabout at the Donald Dewar leisure centre in the Drumchapel area of the city. The pair were joined in a doubles match by teenagers Yaser Razouk and Stephen Grimes.  Both boys, members of the Drumchapel Table Tennis Club, agreed that Kate won in her match against William. Yaser said he thought they would make a really good doubles team. He said: We knew before they came that we were going to give them the bats, but I never thought weaposd end up playing with them. When they were playing each other at singles William was convinced he was winning but I think it was Kate who ended up the winner. Her knack for table tennis appears to extend into the full court game too.Speaking to the Daily Mail, Australian former world number one Rod Laver said: I’d met William and Kate a few times, and in the Royal Box you get a chance to chat with them a little bit.They play tennis against each other. William told me he couldn’t beat her. Rowing The sight of Kate at the helm of a Dragon Boat on the River Thames is one of the defining images of her love story with Prince William. The royal made her now infamous appearance in the boat in  following a brief split from William as the The Sisterhood rowing team prepared for a cross-Channel race in the traditional Chinese vessel against all-boys crew the Brotherhood. The challenge drew throngs of attention from round the world and, though Kate eventually pulled out over security fears, her team went on to complete the gruelling race. The images were so renowned they even made their way into Hollywood’s William and Kate film, which came out shortly before the couple wed. High jump Like that one annoyingly brilliant friend we all know, Kate has proved herself to be a dab hand at nearly every sport over the ears. Sheaposs had a go at cricket, football tennis and even given archery hurdles a go. Perhaps one of the lesser known facts about the accomplished sportwoman, though, is that she still holds a school record in one field. A talented high jumper, Kate set the still-standing record of . metres when she was a pupil at St Andrewaposs School in Pangbourne, Berkshire, which she attended from  to .

Lady Louise Alice Elizabeth Mountbatten-Windsor, , is the daughter of Prince Edward and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex.This week she stepped into the spotlight to commemorate her grandfather Prince Philip in a BBC documentary. Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers aired on BBC One on September , and featured interviews from all of the Queen and The Duke of Edinburghaposs children and adult grandchildren.  Among those who paid tribute was Lady Louise, who recalled her close bond with Prince Philip and their shared love for carriage driving. She is the th in line to the throne and is the grandchild of the Queen, , and her late husband Philip. When her parents Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones got married in , Buckingham Palace announced their children would not be styled as prince or princess. Instead Louise and her brother James, Viscount Severn, are titled as children of an earl. The decision was said to be part of Edward and Sophieaposs hopes for their children to have as normal a childhood as possible.  Thereports that the final decision on whether to take the title of princess will be left up to Louise when she turns . She will choose whether or not to style herself Her Royal Highness Princess Louise after her birthday with her parents, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, said to be leaving the decision up to their daughter. If she decides to take the new title, she will be styled as Her Royal Highness Princess Louise. The Queenaposs other grandchildren have a mixture of titles with Louiseaposs cousins Princess Beatrice and Eugenie also styling themselves as HRH. Princess Anneaposs children Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips have never held HRH status.  Due to the the  Letters Patent HRH titles could only be passed onto the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign’s sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. This was amended in  to include all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. As a result all of the Duke of Cambridgeaposs children have HRH status. Royal expert, Phil Dampier, said that as she comes of age Louise could prove to be the monarchyaposs apossecret weapon.apos He said: Because she’s the granddaughter of the Queen, Lady Louise can call herself a princess when she becomes ... and there’s a strong argument for her doing it.  “She seems to be very mature for her age, and she’s shaping up to be precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on in the future. “Could there be a role for her in a slimmed-down monarchy  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had , patronages between them. You have to ask yourself who is going to continue their legacy, what with Harry and Meghan and Prince Andrew off the scene  There’s a huge workload there.”Meanwhile, there have been several reports that Lady Louise is the Queenaposs favourite grandchild due to their special bond.A royal source previously told The Sun: The Queen loves the fact that Louise and James relish their time at Balmoral, and she has become particularly close to Louise, who seems to have become her favourite grandchild, closely followed by James. The source added: “Louise also endeared herself to everyone by looking after William and Kate’s children when they were up here. “Louise loves drawing and sketching and was very patiently trying to get Charlotte to do pictures of rabbits and deer. Because of her obvious artistic skill, the Queen allowed Louise to look through some of the collection of Queen Victoria’s Highlands sketches which are kept at Balmoral but are rarely dug out these days.” While the spotlight mainly focuses on Princes William and Harry, the Queen has eight grandchildren, and she is said to be close with them all.

Musician Fred Sweenie, who has previously played for the Queen, is struggling with his mental health as a result of the issue.The Royal musician from Burntwood once had his property valued by an agent, but was told that the next door house would knock off at least £, from the value of his home.The semi-detached house next door is so overgrown that sunlight is blocked out and the giant trees mean his family cannot enjoy their garden, Staffordshire Live reports.He says that he has spotted rats running around his garden, and that he will never be able to sell his house as potential buyers will be put off by the state of the property next door.  These issues have left him feeling that his country is letting me down, and he is frustrated that for twelve years, nothing has been done to help his situation. Mr Sweenie played in the RAF Central band for  years and has performed at events including garden parties for the Queen and the Cenotaph in London. He has also toured with former Yes keyboardist, Rick Wakeman. The musician and his we Janet, , and son Guy, , have been complaining about the property to Lichfield council for over a decade, and state that no one has occupied the property for  years.  He said: Every time we try to do something it gets blocked. We donapost know why. We first moved into the property in Rugeley Road in . At the time, next door was well kept and well maintained. This really started to go wrong around  years ago. Our first complaint was around  years ago. It came about after we heard a humming noise coming from next door. We enquired and it turned out the wiring was archaic which led us to be worried about a possible fire hazard. Mr Sweenie added: By , the garden next door was having a serious impact on our health and wellbeing.  Rats had started to appear in our garden and we could see the holes where they were coming in. We reported it to environmental health. No response there. So we went to Mr Fabricantwho was fantastic. He wrote numerous times to the council requesting a full investigation into the property. When they did undergo a full investigation, they said that the property was occupied and that, apart from one shed that was full of food waste that had to be knocked down, there was no need to do anything . It made me very ill and we dropped the inquiries in . I was getting nightmares. That was the worst time I think. The house combined with the rats and the fact that we get no light in our garden because of the towering trees really made me ill. All of these issues have meant thathe ever chooses to sell the property, it will be listed for £, less than it is actually worth because of the nightmare garden next door. Head of corporate services at Lichfield District Council Tracey Tudor said: When investigating this type of neighbourhood complaint we need to establish that the condition of land or buildings is harmful to the area, which is not straightforward.  Having visited the garden on Rugeley Road a number of times, we have found that, although is overgrown, it has a clear path from either end, has plants rather than weeds, and is not covered in litter or dumped items. The owner has told us that he likes his plants and trees to attract wildle. While the garden may not be to everyone’s taste, we do not believe it breaches any planning laws that govern complaints of this nature, and when comparing it to similar cases. While some of the neighbours may not like the garden, others do as it does as it attracts birds. Although there is a dference of opinion about how back gardens should be presented, there are insufficient grounds for us to serve a notice. According to Lichfield council, the next door neighbour has agreed to cut back on some vegetation this month as a compromise.

Andrew Dellbridge, head of Ace Pest Control, said rats in Norwich are getting aposbigger and braverapos, forcing one couple in the city to leave their home. He said another customer was left speechless when she used her bathroom, heard a noise and then saw a rat in the toilet bowl below her. Mr Dellbridge said the terrying episode is becoming increasingly common and he has spotted rats aposas big as catsapos in the city. He told the Norwich Evening News: I was called out to one job in Norwich and the customer could barely speak, she was in so much shock. Sheaposd been using the bathroom and heard a noise. She looked down and it was in the toilet bowl. And this is happening more and more frequently. They used to work around us but now theyaposre gaining access they wouldnapost have attempted before. Mr Dellbridge added that the issue is becoming worse due to overflowing bins and wild verges being filled with rubbish. The pest control boss has been working flat-out through the summer, despite the winter usually being his busiest time of the year. He said cats are no longer a solution to a vermin problem as aposa sensible cat doesnapost like a big ratapos. It comes after huge rats ran riot in lockdown Britain - with easy access to food meaning the vermin grew in size and number.  Footage showed a pair of them - the size of a small cat - stealing food from hungry birds. The plump animals climbed up the frame before gorging themselves on the food. The large rodents were scampering around in broad daylight in full view of a family in Accrington, Lancs. Experts said the easy access to food - with many businesses closed during the pandemic - caused the UKaposs rat population to skyrocket. The number of rats increased from  million to  million during , according to pest control company pest.  The big freeze, lockdowns and food stockpiling created the ideal environment for rats and mice to enjoy a little quiet time in vacant buildings. A rataposs bite is in fact six times stronger, relative to their size, than a great white shark, pest expert Jenny Rathbone said. Pest controllers have seen evidence of cunning rats moving a crisp packet and placing it over a glue trap, to enable them to travel across it without being caught.

Primary school teacher Sabina, , from Kidbrooke, Greenwich in London, was killed as she walked across Cator Park. Her body was found  hours later close on Saturday evening close to the OneSpace community centre. The year one primary school teacher had been minutes away from meeting a friend at a pub when she was killed at around :pm. Her flatmate, who did not want to be named, had seen her earlier that day, saying: “I never thought something like this could happen to her.  She told“I had been texting her and it’s not like her to not reply to my messages. I don’t feel safe living here now.” The politan Police said a man was arrested in Lewisham, south east London. The force also released CCTV images of a man they wish to speak to and a vehicle they are searching for. This is the second arrest the politan Police has made in connection with the attack. On Saturday, detectives arrested a man in his s on suspicion of murder, who was then released under further investigation. The images of the man, taken from CCTV, shows him walking in Pegler Square on the evening Sabina was attacked. Police have also released an image of a silver vehicle they believe the man has access to, which was also captured in the Pegler Square area. They are urging anyone who recognises the man and vehicle to make contact immediately. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, said: “Our team have been working tirelessly to find the person responsible for Sabina’s murder and this has included an extensive trawl of CCTV, work which remains ongoing.

Femicide, the killing of a girl or woman, is a topic that has already been highlighted earlier this year, when Sarah Everard, a -year-old marketing executive, was killed in South London, on her walk back home. These victims tragically add to a horrying statistic that has been recently reported: six women are killed every hour by men around the world, according to UN data. Additionally, a woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK. According to Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census, men’s violence against women is a leading cause of the premature death for women globally but research in the UK and Europe is limited and unconnected. Dr Nilufar Ahmed who works as a Behavioural Psychologist at the University of Bristol helped us identy things men can do to help women feel safer and ways to stop violence towards women. How men can help feel women feel safer while walking alone  Being taught consent from a young age Men should learn to accept a womanaposs lack of interest in them. Violence inflicted on women is often entangled with sexual assaults, and therefore should be educated on consent. According to the United Nations Women , freely given and enthusiastic consent should be mandatory, “every time”. UN Women added that phrases like “she was asking for it” or “boys will be boys” attempt to blur the lines around sexual consent, placing blame on victims, and “excusing perpetrators from the crimes they have committed”.  Dr Nilufar Ahmed explained to the Mirror that changing our social attitudes was something that needed to happen across society and from an early age. She said: Understanding consent from an early age. ‘No means no’ is often framed in terms of sexual consent and rape, but it has a much bigger application –someone is rejecting your attention, friendship, or company in any setting, respect this. Schools can play a role in this by teaching young children about respecting boundaries. Being taught gender equality in schools The World Health Organisationpublished a pamphlet revealing that gender inequalities increase the risk of violence by men against women and inhibit the ability of those affected to seek protection. Experts have found that exposing children to non-stereotypical characters found in books and movies, as well as iding housework equally at home, can help children understand the notion that all genders are equal. Stop victim blaming Victim blaming is a way for someone to justy their motivation behind their own crime, while literally blaming their victim for their own action. Too often the behaviour and personalities of the women is scrutinised and judged first before the actions of the man who attacked them. Dr Nilufar Ahmed told The Mirror. She added: As though it is inevitable that a lone woman walking in the dark is automatically at risk of being attacked.  This victim blaming exonerates men from responsibility and blame by focusing on the woman. Allied with this, often when men commit heinous crimes, their crimes are qualied with added information about their lives as ‘good fathers’ or ‘high achieving students’, whilst the women are described only in terms of the way they were dressed and their actions that night. Becoming a better ally to women Doing something as simple as listening to women and their experiences goes a long way. Men should be able to acknowledge their privilege, as well as taking women’s concerns as a serious issue. Furthermore, men should not shy away from calling out blatant sexism and misogynistic behaviour when they witness it. Being supportive and contributing to the safety of women starts by becoming an ally. Destigmatise men’s mental health As the WHO found that potential perpetrators may be at an increased risk of committing femicidethey are unemployed, own a firearm, have made previous threats to kill with a weapon, or have committed sexual violence, men’s mental health needs to be addressed. Saying things like “man up” or “boys don’t cry” nourishes a culture of toxic masculinity which both prevents men from expressing their feelings, but also lead to dangerous behaviour such as resulting in violence instead of communication. According to Dr Nilufar Ahmed, there is not one reason that pushes men to harm and kill women, but it can include psychological reasons such as feeling rejected, feeling incapable of attracting a partner, being angry, feeling emasculated, a need to assert control, feeling entitled. These do not necessarily have to be about women – a man may experience repeated rejection from jobs, be angry at their landlord, etc, She said. She continued: Unaddressed, this can boil over and be projected onto a target that men are stronger than – women. Most men experiencing these will not go on to harm women butthese feelings are overwhelming go unresolved they can be damaging to the inidual and others around them, and could in extreme circumstances lead to aggression and even murder. If men are struggling with any of these issues accessing mental health support can help to work through them. Facilitate women’s access to protection and safety against domestic violence The WHO has revealed that there is an increased risk of perpetuating femicidethe aggressor has a history of intimate partner or family violence. A men with a history of domestic violence thereby is more likely to murder his partner. Domestic violence is reportedly not taken seriously in UK courts, as criminologist Jane Monkton-Smith toldthat her examination of  domestic abuse killings shows how sentences for manslaughter convictions were often mitigated by “ridiculous claims, like how much the perpetrator said they loved the victim”. Immediate things men can do to help according to a psychologist Dr Nilufar Ahmed said: Immediate things men can do are to be mindful to keep a safe distance from women when out walking or running. If you see a situation where a woman looks uncomfortable don’t be afraid to intervene either yourself or by making someone  aware .As a society we must all take responsibility for collective behaviours and actions. This means calling out comments and behaviour that are disrespectful to women whenever we encounter them.

A -second clip shows a balding man wearing a black hooded coat and grey jeans looking over his shoulder and pulling at his hood as he walks down a path. The Met spokesperson told the Mirror earlier today the force was not speculating about the appearance of the manaposs hands or reports of how Sabina may have been killed. Earlier today reports claim police sources believe she was pounced upon and attacked with a hammer just moments after leaving her flat on what should have been a five-minute walk across a park to her pub date.  Detectives have also released an image, captured in the Pegler Square area of Kidbrooke, of a silver car they believe the man has access to. The Met has appealed for anyone who recognised either to contact the force immediately. Detective chief inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said an extensive trawl of CCTV in the area continued and said information on the manaposs identity and whereabouts could be vital to the investigation. Sabina was walking to meet a date at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home at around .pm last Friday when she was attacked.  A member of the public found her body under a pile of leaves close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, in the borough of Greenwich, on Saturday at around .pm. The politan Police said a -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder. The suspect was arrested at an address in Lewisham on Thursday and is being questioned in custody. It is the second arrest Scotland Yard has made in connection with the attack. On Saturday, detectives arrested a man in his s on suspicion of murder before he was released under further investigation.  Ms Nessaaposs cousin Zubel Ahmed remembered her as a beautul soul who loved teaching, telling the BBC that she was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet. Lisa Williams, the head of Rushey Green Primary School where Ms Nessa taught, said staff and pupils are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news of her death and will be remembering the teacher privately. In a statement, Mrs Williams said: We have shared the details about the vigil with our school community and some people may be attending on a personal level to privately pay their respects.  As a school we are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news we received this week, and will be commemorating Sabina in our own way. The vigil is being held on Friday evening at pm at Pegler Square, and people who cannot attend are being encouraged to hold a candle at their doorstep at the same time. Reclaim These Streets, a campaign group involved in supporting the Kidbrooke communityaposs vigil for Sabina, said it is angry and heartbroken about her murder. Tower Hamlets Councillor Rabina Khan told BBC Radio aposs Today programme said she was attending the vigil this evening and hoped high profile people would also attend. I too, just like my daughters, I have a -year-old, I have a -year-old, we spoke up for Sarah Everard, she said. When we saw high profile people who attended , I was really pleased and proud that the Duchess of Cambridge attended the vigil... I hope, tonight, we see many profiled people attending Sabina Nessaaposs vigil.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Scotland Yardpolitan PoliceCCTVMurderCCTV footageSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Nessa, , was taking a five-minute walk to meet a friend at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on September  at around .pm when she was attacked. A member of the public found her body close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park on Saturday at around .pm. A -year-old man arrested in connection with the murder has been released under investigation, the politan Police said today.  The man was arrested on Thursday at an address in Lewisham, south-east London, and detectives are continuing to appeal for information about another man captured on CCTV in Pegler Square on the evening Ms Nessa was attacked. In a statement released to the PA news agency ahead of a rally at the East London Mosque, her sister Jebina Yasmin Islam said: We as a family are shocked of the murder of our sister, daughter and aunty to my girls. There are no words to describe how we are feeling as a family at the moment. We did not expect that something likewould ever happen to us. I urge everyone to walk on busy streets when walking home from work, school or a friendaposs homes. Please keep safe.  I ask you to pray for our sister and make duafor her. May Allahgrant her paradise. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, told PA: Speaking as a woman and a Londoner from the cityaposs Bangladeshi community, Iaposm heartbroken. Sabina is related to members of my extended family and everything I know about her speaks of a beautul, intelligent young woman who had so much le to live, and so, so much to offer in terms of making a positive dference to the peopleaposs lives she touched, not least her familyaposs and the young children she taught at school. Tragically, gender-based violence does not occur in isolation. I do not know how many more women will suffer before our streets are safe. What I do know is that Sabinaaposs death fills all of us with grief. Londoners, regardless of their gender, are hopeful that Sabinaaposs murderer will be found and brought to justice swtly.  Community leaders and Asian women, some of whom said they were too wary to attend a vigil for Ms Nessa on Friday night in south-east London but still wanted to show their solidarity in a location they feel safe, are among those who are gathering at the mosque. Fridayaposs events in memory of Ms Nessa come a week after she died and as the public spotlight is thrown on womenaposs safety and gender-based violence. Her death comes after the public outrage and protests over the abduction and murder of -year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard as she walked home alone in south London in March. Sufia Alam, of the East London Mosque and the Maryam Centre, said: This brutal murder of one of our shining stars is genuinely saddening and deeply shocking. I have three daughters, and I canapost even begin to express what I am feeling right now. Sarah Everard was one of our daughters, and so was Sabina Nessa - their lives were tragically cut short - at the hands of violence and brutality. We have much work to do against the violence faced by women in our society. We will not stop campaigning until our mothers, sisters and daughters are safe anywhere and everywhere. She said this state of affairs is not just about women and girls being vulnerable, this is about men and boys and educating them early on about respecting and honouring women and girls, and treating them with the dignity they deserve. Ms Alam, who is set to be at the east London rally where many women are due to attend, added: When a Muslim woman is murdered, this dampens the aspirations of other Muslim women and girls in education and employment - and this will be particularly hard for us to deal with and manage.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON House of CommonsMurderCrimePoliticsHate crimeSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What was the cause of death  A post-mortem carried out at Greenwich Mortuary proved to be inconclusive, police said on Monday. Detectives have said they believe she was hit with a heavy object and was taken to Cator Park, where her body was found. A Met Police spokesman said the force is not commenting on the reporting on the suspected murder weapon.Who killed her Police have said they were keeping an open mind on a motive to the killing, which has been widely reported as a suspected stranger attack Speaking at the scene where tributes had been laid to Sabina next to the police cordon at Cator Park on Thursday, Detective Chief Superintendent Trevor Lawry said earlier he is “keeping a completely open mind” on what the motive of the attacker may have been.  Asked whether detectives were worried the killer could attack someone , he said: “We have lines of inquiry that we’re pursuing at the moment. “It’s always a concern that it may happen, but that’s not something that we have any intelligence on at this time.” Asked whether he believed the killing was a stranger attack, DCI Lawry told reporters:“That’s definitely a line of inquiry that we’re looking at.” Sabinaaposs flatmate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters she feels unsafe after losing her friend. Her fearful housemate of four months said she had last seen Sabina when the pair hung out and took pictures together.She told: ‘I never thought something like this could happen to her. I had been texting her and it’s not like her to not reply to my messages.“I don’t feel safe living here now.”  Who is the man in the CCTV images  Police say CCTV images of a man seen walking through south London is another person they would like to speak to. The force says the unknown man was in the area at the time of the attack, as well as pictures of a silver car they believe he has access to. The images of the man, taken from CCTV, shows him walking in Pegler Square, south London, on the evening Sabina was attacked. Where is the mystery car captured on CCTV going  Police have also released an image of the car they believe the man has access to, which was also captured in the Pegler Square area. Police are urging anyone who recognises the man and vehicle to make contact immediately. They have not revealed any more detail yet about exactly where or when the car was seen or what direction it was heading. However they have said they are appealing for sightings of the man and car across the south London borough of Greenwich, including in Catford, Kidbrooke and Greenwich itself. Have arrests been made  A man in his s was arrested on suspicion of murder at an address in Lewisham on Saturday evening, and was later released under police investigation. The politan Police announced on Thursday that a second, -year-old man had been arrested at an address in Lewisham on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder and was being held in custody.  What you can you to help Police want to speak to anyone who may have seen anything that could help their investigation. Anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV images or has seen him in recent days is being urged to contact the Met. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said: Our team have been working tirelessly to find the person responsible for Sabinaaposs murder and this has included an extensive trawl of CCTV, work which remains ongoing. We would ask anyone - especially those in Kidbrooke and the wider area of Lewisham and Greenwich - to take a careful look at these images to check whether you know who this man is or have seen him over recent days. Any information as to his identity or whereabouts could be vital for our investigation so we are asking you to share this image far and wide to ensure as many people as possible see it.  Where to attend the vigil for Sabina Nessa Vigils are being held for Sabina in locations around London later on Friday, and people are being encouraged to light candles on their doorsteps.

To perform the test, try and walk up four flights of stairs. If you are able to trek up the flights without trouble, youaposre not a risk, a study says.  Experts and researchers from the University Hospital A Coruna in Spain believe those who can manage the feat in less than a minute have better heart . Lead author Dr Jesus Peteiro, a cardiologist at University Hospital A Coruna, Spain, said: The stairs test is an easy way to check your heart health. If it takes you more than one-and-a-half minutes to ascend four flights of stairs, your health is suboptimal, and it would be a good idea to consult a doctor.  The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are: chest pain, shortness of breath and pain throughout the body, as well as feeling faint and also feeling sick . Last week, it was revealed in a study during a follow-up of almost  years of adults with hearts disease that continued low physical activity was linked to  per cent lower risk of dying from any cause. And sustained high physical activity was linked to a  per cent lower risk of death compared to those who are inactive, the Nord-Trondelag Health Study found.Coronary heart diseaseis a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide. CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease. The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are:chest painshortness of breath pain throughout the body feeling faint feeling sick Coronary heart disease can develop when your heartaposs blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. The process - atherosclerosis - is when the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits, which are called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.

It’s important to note that everyone copes with grief in dferent ways, and there is no real right or wrong in the grieving process.With digital reminders of your loved one on social media s like Facebook and Instagram, things can get really tough. Although there are ways to turn off the profiles, you may still miss their online presence and knowing that they are a short message away for a quick chat.Reopening old text messages are bound to bring up many emotions, but what about those who continue to text their loved one  It’s now a common coping mechanism, and experts say it can actually be useful for those to deal with the transition. When considering why many people do this to cope with their loss, psychologist Ingrid Collins said: “When a loved one dies, we find it hard to adjust immediately to the fact that they are no longer physically with us. “In the first stages of grief, we tend to become emotionally numb as a result of the trauma of bereavement, often finding it dficult to accept that they are really gone.”FRisk is a wakeup call for the millions of people with no will or protection in place for their own death.

Get your FREE FRisk Score now by clicking here. It is in this phase that many find it comforting to ease adjustment to a loss by continuing on a conversation. Ingrid continued: “Be it imaginary, as some believe, or communicating with the lingering soul of the loved one, as others believe. “Either way, it is a way of softening the harsh reality of never being in their physical presence again.  As a culture, it’s no doubt that we are taught to cope well with bereavement, with a “stf upper lip” approach for many. To some, that may signy that the inidual may not be coping well at all, and bottling up any emotions from others. When talking about text messaging loved ones that have passed away, Ingrid said: “Any method that enables us to prolong the comfort of the relationship with the deceased or,the bond was challenging, to go some way to resolving the relationship, is to be welcomed. “Sometimes people cling on to their loved one’s physical possessions that serve as a reminder. “This is one way of adjusting. Some take up a campaign in order to bring some meaning to what might otherwise appear to be a random or supposedly preventable death.” In short, those who choose to communicate with a deceased person are “taking an effective shortcut to arriving at some measure of acceptance.” Comment MORE ON GrievingText messagesFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bradley Lynn, , and Connor Williams, , have been filmed carrying stacks of waste to leave at deserted roadsides. Environment chiefs launched an investigation to find the fly-tippers after they used fake number plates to carry out the crimes. CCTV footage shows Lynn and Williams apparently travelling in an untaxed and unregistered tipper van. The pair were spotted dumping rubbish at a former LG site in Newport, South Wales, in September and October last year. The site has been dubbed the Road to Nowhere as it has become a hotspot for fly-tipping.  Lynn, of Splott, Cardf, and Williams, of Trowbridge, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Environmental Protection Act . Magistrates in Newport fined each man £ and ordered them to pay costs of £, and a victimaposs surcharge of £. Newport city council said it worked with Gwent Police and Fly Tipping Action Wales to bring them to court.  After the case, Councillor Roger Jeavons said: I would like to thank the public for providing information that led to the identication of these two people. As well as fines, they could have faced being sent to prison for this crime and I hope this prosecution will act as a deterrent to others who illicitly dump waste. Residents should also note thatthey employ others to clear waste and itaposs not disposed of legally then they would also be liable and could be prosecuted.  We will not hesitate to take action against those who deliberately dump refuse on our land. It is a crime that blights our communities, the city and our environment and it will not be tolerated.

There will be three more days of sunshine - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - before the weather turns cooler next week. The mini-heatwave has only affected southern parts of the country, while northern areas have experienced strong winds and heavy rain. The best conditions and high temperatures will be felt in the east and central parts of the UK over the next few days, according to the Met Office. Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: “Plenty more sunshine across much of the country today.  “Much of southern Scotland and certainly most of England and Wales will have another fine day of September sunshine. “Temperatures are responding to that sunshine, heading up into the low twenties - C, maybe C across parts of the south east.” But the early autumn sunshine will only continue for a few more days before torrential rain and gales hit Britain and temperatures turn cooler. The Met Office said that at the beginning of next week Brits will see a sht in weather conditions.An active weather front will bring heavy rain and blustery winds as it pushes in from the west across the UK, forecasters said. Meteorologist Adam Thornhill said: For the rest of this week and for the weekend, we will continue to see low pressure systems bringing blustery weather to the north of the UK whereas further south the drier, warmer weather remains thanks to the influence of high pressure extending up from the Azores. However, a sht in the position of the jet stream brings a change in our weather next week, allowing a cold front associated with a low-pressure system in the North Atlantic to spread eastwards bringing wet and windy conditions across the whole country throughout Monday.  Behind the cold front, conditions will feel much more autumnal with a cooler feel and blustery showers for many. Next week, gusty winds will create a more autumnal feel across many areas of the country. The Met Office said the weather will turn cooler from Monday, but temperatures are expected to slowly recover to above average as we move into October. UK  day weather forecast This Evening and Tonight: Some rain crossing Scotland, with low cloud, mist and drizzle also spreading to some western areas later. Further south and east, some clear spells, and for southern and central England the chance of some fog patches. Windy in the north. Friday: Low cloud and drizzle continuing to affect some areas especially parts of the west and southwest, though some sunshine east of hills. Further east, a better share of warm sunshine. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Mainly fine and warm Saturday. Some rain for the northwest. Scattered showers overnight into Sunday, perhaps heavy in the southeast. Squally band of rain pushes east Sunday and into Monday.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeatherMet Office\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But it was the reason why one particular child couldn’t focus that changed everything for deputy head-teacher Rebekah Wilson.“A boy in my class didn’t seem his normal happy self and he couldn’t concentrate for scratching his stomach,” says -year-old Rebekah, known as Bex. “He told me he didn’t have a bed at home, and the cushion he shared with his brother to sleep on was infested with bed bugs.”This was the moment that Bex, who works at an inner city primary school in Leeds, realised the impact that hygiene could have on her pupils and their education. “Times are hard for some families who are having to choose what they can do without,” she says. “Hygiene items often get sacriced. We’re not talking luxuries here, just the absolute basics like toilet roll, shampoo, deodorant, shower gel and soap. “Going without these things affects kids’ self-esteem. Imagine what it’s likeyou can’t keep yourself clean or you don’t have clean clothes  It can really stop children learning, engaging and taking part at school and it can lead to bullying or them being singled out.” Happily there’s an organisation that’s helping to relieve the pressure. The Hygiene Bank, which stresses that being clean is a basic human right, collects new, unused, in-date personal care and household cleaning essentials and distributes them to families in need through schools like Bex’s and charities.  And Boots has been supporting The Hygiene Bank by hosting more than  banks in stores across the UK where customers can donate their own hygiene products. The retailer then donates four products for every kilogram that has been donated. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are two items Bex knows are particularly needed. “So many children are coming to school with tooth problems now,” she says. “Bad dental health can cause a lot of pain and distress and really affect children’s confidence.” But something as simple as shampoo or shower gel can also improve the wellbeing and happiness of those struggling to stay afloat. “I had a mum in tears the other day because we’d given her a hygiene package that included some shower gel. As little as a p bottle can make a dference. She said it felt like Christmas.” Another mum had just £ left for her weekly shopping. “She needed nappies, washing powder and washing up liquid. She didn’t know what to buy because she knew she couldn’t get it all.” Hygiene products provided through The Hygiene Bank across the UK help fill the gap. “We all deserve a certain minimum,” says Bex. “We need to ensure every family has access to these basics, and remove the stigma of asking for support, making sure that families are treated with respect.” Boots leads big donation drive Boots and charity The Hygiene Bank are working together to provide much-needed hygiene and personal care products to people living in poverty.  In the last year, Boots, which has more than  donation points in stores across the UK, has given more than , items – from toothpaste to shower gel, soap to shampoo – to hundreds of communities and charities across the UK. Boots donates hygiene products to The Hygiene Bank. And since it believes every child has the right to feel good when they go back to school, Boots has also worked with the charity to design educational resources for parents and teachers to help young people understand hygiene and hygiene poverty. In its ‘You donate  we donate’ initiative, Boots gives four products for every kilogram of items donated to The Hygiene Bank in Boots stores.You can donate at your local Boots donation point, through the boots e-voucher scheme, and directly to The Hygiene Bank.

It all got a bit heated.I was prepared to be called a hypocrite, a fascist and to be asked why I don’t go to China to be shot at . I’ve been managing quite well during the last few weeks to stay calm during the barrage of questions that have been coming my way. People have been quite rightly furious and upset by what we are doing and I accept that. What frustrated me on Wednesday was the refusal by the other people on the programme to accept the physical reality we are in. The reality that Sir David King means when he says, “What we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity”. That’s the reason I’m on the telly sitting through that rage and anger. It is because I really care about the country I live in and all the people who live here. Do you agree with Insulate Britainaposs actions  Have your say in the comments below  What the GMB presenters are not ready to accept is that climate breakdown isn’t primarily about survival of polar bears and dolphins, as important as they are, but about the survival of our economy, our NHS and of the very fabric of our society. This means many people will suffer.  What Insulate Britainis asking for is to conserve our society. To do that at this time means having to make some tough decisions, we understand that. The comparisons to Churchill on the programme upset Richard Madeley. I wasn’t saying that IB were the same as Churchill, what I was saying was that there were some similarities. The people that didn’t want to oppose Hitler were seen as appeasing Hitler. Churchill understood that you either faced up to the reality now or you paid for it later. He had the support of just six MPs. That meant that  million people lost their lives. It was locked in. There is a similarity now. If we don’t move as rapidly as Sir David King says we should, the suffering of millions of people in the next few decades will be locked in, unstoppable. What was happening on GMB on Wednesday was appeasement. A refusal to accept the reality, while also turning their anger of that reality onto me. Well we feel angry too. Angry that our government has ignored our letters, petitions and protests for  years.Insulating our homes is our line in the sand and we will not let them cross it. It gives the best value for money in terms of CO emissions, will provide hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs and will stop tens of thousands of our elderly from freezing to death each winter and means families can heat and eat. This isnapost aboutmy home is insulated or not. Itaposs not about whether Iaposm a hypocrite for calling for all homes to be insulated. Itaposs about how tackling the climate crisis will not only save our country from destruction, but also benefit millions of our citizens and bring them out of fuel poverty. Itaposs a win-win. What Richard and Susanna don’t seem to understand is thatthe government continues to ignore us, it will get much more heated.

Emma Cousins, , from Sheffield, has been living with one eye after being diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in April . She had noticed her left eye appearing to grow and bulge and shortly after her daughteraposs second birthday she went to AE to get checked out as she started to feel unwell. Emma, who is mum to an -year-old son and five-year-old daughter, said: “My eye felt stretched and I felt sick. “The doctor thought it was a small bleed so I saw an out of hours optician who askedI had any selfies on my phone.  “I had six years’ worth of pictures so I showed the optician, who asked to see pictures of me from further back. “It was at that point I thought ‘oh no something is wrong’. I managed to find pictures of me at . “The optician said he didn’t know for sure but that it looked like something had been growing behind my eye since I was .” Looking at the images side-by-side, Emma could see a subtle dference as her eye appeared to grow and bulge over time. She was booked in for an MRI scan which found a large tumour growing behind her eye and in April  a biopsy was taken to seeit could be salvaged.  Sadly, nothing could be done and she was diagnosed with a form of sarcoma cancer – and told she would lose her eye. Emma said: “I thought ‘no, it can’t be, I’m too young’ and the doctor was acting very nervous. “The doctor said ‘the eye will have to come out’ and told me I’m the only person in England with it, and that chemotherapy wouldn’t work.“He told me not to Google it but obviously that was the first thing I did when I was alone.“I wish I had listened as all I could find were pages saying it spreads to the lungs and you die. “After reading that it made me panic and the reality kicked in – I was going to lose my eye and I had cancer.” Over the following weeks, surgeons planned the tricky, warning Emma that, while they would remove as much of the tumour as possible, she would be left disfigured. Emma said: “I had to tell my children because, with my eye going, I couldn’t hide it from them. “I told them I needed to have my eye removed then I would be better.” In June , she had her eyeball removed in a terrying procedure. Emma said: “I was nervous but knowing I had cancer and how bad it could be made me feel better about it. “Losing an eye for a chance of saving my le was a risk I was willing to take. “I think one of the worst things was  minutes before the eye removal, one of the nurses drew an arrow on my forehead to highlight which eye it was – and for the rest of my time left with two eyes I was panicking they would take the wrong eye out by mistake. “My main concern was what would happen with the kids – my daughter was so young at the time, so she wouldn’t remember anything about me.” Thankfully, Emma made it through the tough surgery and started a six-week course of radiation therapy, which caused burns to her skin. Sadly, she had a reaction to the treatment and ended up in ICU connected to a ventilator as she fought off the debilitating symptoms linked to fulminant multiple sclerosis, which left her “completely paralysed”. She said: “I couldn’t even talk – it was like being completely locked in my own body, unable to communicate anything. “Doctors told my family I would die, but to their surprise I regained the ability to talk, my arms started to work, and I have slowly recovered to the point I can now walk myself – although not as well as I used to.”  Her medics were left equally baffled by the adverse reaction and much is still unclear about why Emma suffered so much post-surgery. As soon as she saw herself with one eye, Emma realised she looked “dferent to anybody ”. She said: “The first thing I can remember thinking was ‘wow it doesn’t look as bad as I thought’. “It was still a few months before it all settled and the bruising had gone down, but it looked so much nicer than I had presumed it would look. “I actually liked it because everything has been done now with hair and makeup, whereas everyone notices how dferent I look – and I try to live up to that with my eye patches. “After all, they are going to stare at me anyway, so why not give them something to stare at ” Later that month in June , Emma was referred to have a prosthetic eye made, but found it to look “fake” and be too much “faff”, so opted instead to wear glasses and eye patches. Over time, a small hole developed in her empty socket – which doctors believe was caused by the radiation – that has been widened. Emma said: “Because the radiation has killed veins in my socket they supply the skin with blood and because blood cannot get to the area the skin dies and that’s what the hole is. “I’ve waited over a year for the operation but now the hole is getting bigger simple things like having a shower or being in heavy rain can drown me. “As the hole is directly connected to my lungs – meaning anything going in my eye can enter my lungs. “I have to stay away from a swimming pool and baths as I could drown.” Her children have been incredibly supportive, as Emma explained: “They have been wonderful. When the hole first appeared to now, they have had to see it grow in size but have been great at adapting – even though it has meant no swimming, which they love. “I don’t think they realise just how good they have been throughout all of this. “They have had to grow up so fast and seen daily not only how big the hole is getting, but my daily struggle to recover.” Despite her suffering, she has received global attention on TikTok, after taking to the social media  to share videos of her empty socket. One video received  million views, with thousands of fans cheering her on. One person said: I would just like to say this is not scary but inspiring, unique and beautul. Because this is who you are. This is so powerful, another fan added. Someone  commented: No offence but it kinda looks like your eye is breathing but your beautul. [sic] Emma also showed off her unique party tricks – which include blowing out candles with the hole in her socket. Now, the mum is focusing on continuing her recovery, which should involve a procedure taking a chunk of skin from her leg to cover the hole in her eye socket.

Joanne Elmes said the mark looked like a textbook sign of cancer, prompting her to send a picture of it to the doctors.Her mum was then handed a two-week urgent referral for the mole to be removed, PlymouthLive reports.Doctors confirmed her mum had melanoma in situ - which is the earliest stage of skin cancer - and luckily the disease had not spread through her body. Joanne thought something might be wrong after noticing her mumaposs mole had a iation of colours with irregular borders. The dentist described the mole as looking just like the photographed examples of superficial spreading malignant melanoma.  Joanne and her fellow healthcare professionals have become the first line of defence in spotting skin cancer in patients after skin cancer charity Skcin rolled out an education programme in  aimed at those who work in the hair, beauty and healthcare industry. The thought process behind the roll out was that these iniduals would be spending a lot of time with customers or patients, meaning they would be perfectly placed to observe abnormalities or changes that may occur on their client’s or patient’s skin. Discussing how she was able to spot the early signs of skin cancer in her mum, Joanne said: I had seen a mole on the back of my motheraposs arm that looked dferent. I carried out closer inspection.  It was approximately mm in diameter, irregular borders, and iation of colours. I felt it looked just like the photographed examples of superficial spreading malignant melanoma given to me in my Pro training with Skcin. I took a photo of it next to a tape measure and my mother uploaded the photograph on an e-consult form to the doctors. She got a  week urgent referral and had it removed by dermatology. It has now been confirmed to be an aposin situapos melanoma and therefore has not spread thankfully. It was on the back of her right arm. Risk factors included: sun bathing when she was young, wearing olive oil and lemon juice on her skin, using sunbeds in her early twenties, and living in New Zealand for four years. Iaposve also encouraged my dad to go to the doctors which he now has a two-week referral as he has a suspicious lesion on his foot! Iaposve done so many more referrals as a dental therapist from before the training. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Since the early s rates of non-melanoma skin cancer has risen by % in the UK with cases expected to reach almost , by . The incidence of melanoma has risen faster than any other common cancer in the UK. According to Cancer Research UK,  in  males and  in  females will be diagnosed with melanoma during their letime and alarmingly, it is one of the biggest killing cancers in the - age group. However, the good news is that around % of all cases are preventable. It is also the only cancer we can physically see developing in it’s early stages, so with education, the hope is these statistics can reverse and save many lives. What Causes Skin Cancer Around % of all skin cancers are caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun and or sun beds. Sunburn, reddening, peeling and even tanning of the skin, is clear indication of sun damage. While many people associate a tan with looking healthy, a tan is actually a sign that our skin has been harmed by UV radiation and is trying to defend itself against further damage. Sunburn has strong links to melanoma. When we burn, the superficial layers of the skin release chemicals that cause the blood vessels to expand and leak fluid, causing swelling, pain and redness. Without sun protection UV radiation starts to penetrate deep into the layers of the skin, causing damage to the DNA in our skin cells. Damage from UV is cumulative and irreparable, therefore once the tan fades, the damage remains, which can result in serious consequences over time.  Is skin cancer risk determined by skin colour  We all have ying skin colours that respond dferently to UV radiation emitted from the sun. However, everyone, regardless of skin colour, can sunburn and accumulate sun damage, meaning we are all at risk from skin cancer. Melanin - the natural pigment that gives our skin dferent colours exists to help protect our skin from UV radiation. When we tan our skin is busy producing melanin to help protect it from the sun’s harmful rays. The darker our skin, the more melanin we have and the longer it takes our skin to burn. The paler our skin, the less melanin we have and the quicker our skin will burn. Although those with fairer skin who tend to burn more easily are at greater risk of skin cancer, the simple fact that our skin has changed colour is a sign of sun damage. Damage is permanent and cumulative, so the more we tan or burn, the greater our inidual risk of developing skin cancer. Whilst Caucasians are the primary victims of skin cancer - everyone, regardless of skin colour, can fall prey to it. It is a common misconception that people with darker skin colours are immune to melanoma. This is one reason why people of colour are diagnosed with skin cancer at later stages. Unfortunately, these delays mean that skin cancers are often more advanced and potentially fatal, whereas most skin cancers,detected early, are almost always curable. How should we protect our skin from UV radiation  Around % of skin cancers can be avoided by adopting simple sun safe strategies. Simply check the daily UV Index and when UV levels reach  or above take action to protect your skin by following Skcin’s Five S’s of Sun Safety:Slip on clothing Slop on sunscreen Slap on a sun hat Slide on sunglasses Shade from the sun What steps can we take to detect the early signs of skin cancer  Skin cancers seldom hurt and are much more frequently seen than felt. The sooner a skin cancer is identied and treated, the better a person’s chance of avoiding surgery, or in the case of a serious melanoma, potential disfigurement or even death. Getting to know your skin and regularly checking it thoroughly from head to toe, is the best way to spot any potential warning signs. Experts advise checking yourself once a month. There are lots of dferent kinds of skin cancers that can appear in many shapes, sizes and colours, so it’s wise to swot up on the ious forms and characteristics to understand what to look out for. However, as a general rule of thumb use the following checklist andyou detect anything of concern, seek immediate advice from your GP or dermatologist. If a new or existing skin, nail or mucosalpigmented or nonpigmented spot, lump, lesion, mole or freckle:Gets bigger and or changes in shape, particularly getting an irregular outline. Changes colour, gets darker, becomes patchy or multi-shaded. Becomes elevated, firm to touch and is growing. Starts to itch, gets painful, starts bleeding, gets crusty or becomes inflamed. Looks or is behaving dferently to the rest of your moles or skin lesions. Is evolving in any way, such as: changes in size, symmetry, surface characteristics or symptomsSkcin now have trained over  healthcare professionals, all who have embraced the opportunity to upskill and join Skcin’s in our fight to combat skin cancer and get skin cancers detected sooner and raise awareness and the profile of skin cancer in UK.To find out more about the work Skcin do you can visit their website here.

The Sussexes arrived in the Big Apple on Thursday, visiting a   memorial along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and the stateaposs governor, Kathy Hochul. While in New York, they have booked to stay at The Carlyle, known as New Yorkaposs “Tower of Power”, and have been spotted having a drink at the hotel’s bar. The Carlyle was known to be a favourite of Harryaposs mum Princess Diana, who often stayed there when she was in the city.  Diana first visited New York in February  as a royal for a three-day solo tour, and ed to the same hotel after her orce in , where she reportedly stayed in the ,-square-foot “Royal Suite” on the nd floor. According to the  documentary “Always the Carlyle”, the late Princess shared the hotel lt with Michael Jackson and Steve Jobs. Prince William and Kate Middleton also stayed at the hotel when they visited New York for a series of royal engagements in .  In another subtle tribute to the Princess of Wales, Harry and Meghan spoke about a subject that was also close to Diana’s heart. While touring the One World Observatory on Thursday, the couple spoke about mental health with Mr De Blasio. The New York City mayor said: “They’re good people and they’re really committed to the world. “I got a great vibe, particularly the work that they’re doing on mental health ... I think the prince makes a great point when he says, ‘mental fitness,’ calling it ‘mental fitness’ as a positive aspirational idea. That was one of the things we talked about. I really admire what they’re both doing on that.”  While she never set out to be an advocate for mental health, Diana had also broken royal barriers decades before by candidly discussing her own struggles with mental health, including postpartum depression, bulimia and self-harm. In a  interview with the BBC, she described her bulimia as “like a secret disease”. “You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don’t think you’re worthy or valuable,” she said. “You fill your stomach up four or five times a day — some do it more — and it gives you a feeling of comfort.” She added: “It’s like having a pair of arms around you but it’s temporarily, temporary.”  She went on to say that the immense pressure to keep her marriage together left her “crying for help”, but that others used her eating disorder as “a coat on a hanger. “They decided that was the problem — Diana was unstable,” she said. In February , Diana paid a visit to Henry Street Settlement’s Urban Family Center in New York, which offers services and shelter for homeless families with children. During her visit, she met with a group of formerly homeless women who worked at the centre as well as a family who was living there at the time.  The organisation tweeted: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in town raising mental health awareness. It reminds us of Princess Diana’s memorable visit to Henry Street in !Writing for Curbed in , the centre’s chief administrator of homeless and transitional housing at the time, Verona Middleton-Jeter, described the royal visit: “She was interested in the problems of homeless women and families, and the program that we had, but she asked more questions about women who were in abusive relationships.”Harry and Meghan are due to appear at Global Citizen Live on Saturday in Central Park to urge world leaders to adopt a vaccine equity policy to help end the pandemic. During their visit the Sussexes, who now run their own charitable foundation Archewell, also met with the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.Writing on Twitter, the ambassador said they had an “important discussion” that included the pandemic, racial justice and raising awareness of mental health.When asked about herto New York, Ms Markle told reporters: “Itaposs wonderful to be back, thank you.” Comment MORE ON York City Football ClubBig Apple CompaniesBBCMeghan MarklePrince HarryMichael JacksonPrincess DianaSteve Jobs  attacksDocumentariesRoyal FamilyEating disordersMental healthFitnessHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

High school sweethearts Joel Forchue, , and Mickey Pagan, , met each other in Rhode Island in  when Mickey started attending the school Joel was at. They quickly took an interest in each other and started dating, staying together after high school and starting a le together. Mickey had always known she was bisexual and Joel would joke around with her, saying he was going to have aposfive wivesapos and aposbabies everywhere, of every nationalityapos. One day Mickey called his bluff and suggested they find a girlfriend. In September , Joel met Jaida Cutino, , on MeetMe, an app that allowed people to chat and make friends.  As Mickey listened to them chatting, she realised she also had common interests with Jaida. Over time, the couple would wait for Jaida to come online to chat to her and Jaida would wait for the couple. On November , , Mickey and Joel asked Jaida to be their girlfriend and shortly after, Joel got down on one knee and asked Mickey for her hand in marriage. To combat the jealousy that can arise in their relationship, the trio say they stay true to themselves and their intentions and remind each other that no one is loved more than the other.  When they have a moment of jealousy, they always reassure each other and make sure those thoughts donapost escalate. Despite their love for one another, Jaida and Joel have lost contact with members of their families over the relationship. Jaidaaposs mother no longer speaks to her and Jaida says she feels like sheaposs been disowned. Joelaposs mother also stopped talking to him, however he says the younger members of his family have been much more supportive. My family donapost agree with it, they say a man is supposed to be with one woman and thereaposs not supposed to be extra partners, said Jaida.  I used to get really upset and hurt about it because Iaposm a big family person and there was a point where I was really depressed and unhappy about the situation. I still hope one day theyaposll accept Joel and Mickey but I donapost see it moving in that direction. Sometimes my family will invite me to a party but tell me to come on my own and that I shouldnapost bring the people I love. The throuple say people tell them that theyaposre aposgoing to hellapos or that theyaposre aposungodlyapos but the trio hit back and say they go to church and pray before they eat, when they wake up and when they go to bed and feel incredibly close to God.  Being in a triad is like having two best friends and le partners instead of one, said Mickey. Weaposre never alone and thereaposs always someone  to talk to. We donapost see our relationship any dferent and go through le just like everyone . Thankfully my mum is very open and accepting, she says that she has four children now - she always used to call Joel her son and now she calls Jaida her daughter. I want people to know that weaposre all lucky, not just Joel, me and Jaida are lucky too.  People say weaposre not godly because of our relationship but weaposre incredibly close to God and try to be closer and closer every day. If one of us gets pregnant, Joel wants to get the other pregnant so we have kids at the same time and can go through the pregnancy together. We havenapost got anything planned - but at the same time itaposs kind of planned. The throuple say thereaposs no favouritism in the relationship and they all treat each other as equals. Joel and Mickey donapost let the time theyaposve spent together prior to meeting Jaida impact their relationship now. People ask us for advice or a better understanding of a polyamorous relationship but the truth is we donapost know because we didnapost plan for this, said Joel.

I get called a pimp or people tell me Iaposm a big daddy or a big man when really thereaposs three of us in the relationship. There is no handbook, all polyamorous and throuple relationships are dferent with dferent rules. Itaposs about whataposs in front of you and living in the moment - we wanted something and we got it. Being in this relationship as a straight man, Iaposve started to understand what people in the LGBT community go through. It helps me be more empathetic and talk to more people about it.

A poor little Golden Retriever puppy, called Millie, only wanted to be included in her big sisters’ fun and games, but the little tyke struggled to get their attention due to her small stature.The clip, which was posted by the TikTok user @missygoldenretrievers, begins with Millie trying to get the attention of her much bigger sisters, who are busy play fighting, by jumping all over one of them.The puppy then attempts to get involved by biting at her sister’s leg, but this proves to not be enough to distract the larger dogs from their ongoing battle with one another.  Eventually, Millie resorts to jamming her face right into the middle of where her big sisters are attempting to bite at each other, before ing to her early tactic of leg nibbling. Sadly, Millie is unable to get the inclusion she is after this time, as her tiny frame simply doesn’t yet have the necessary size to get the attention she wants from her sisters. Viewers clearly felt sorry for the little pup, with one user commenting: “Poor Millie is being ignored.” TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal.

It also received countless comments, mostly from people urging Sam to quit - saying she should have practised more before committing to tattooing someone.What do you think about the tattoo  Let us know in the comments...In the video, Sam unveils the tattoo which is a minimalist outline of a womanaposs face with a rose over one eye, which was inked onto a red-haired womanaposs back. Captioning the video, Sam wrote: I have to say itaposs not bad for my first time tattooing on someone other than myself. I was nervous.

Sam then replied askingthe user had anything  to say, to which they wrote: Yeah, do not tattoo anyone until youaposre actually ready. In the clip, Sam reveals her artwork by wiping her clientaposs back with a paper towel - but that angered TikTok viewers too as people noticed she wasnapost wearing protective gloves. One user said: If you actually want a future in tattooing, take this down. No decent tattoo shop would hire someone blatantly ignoring biohazard safety like this.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said that she had been with her partner for three years and they were very happy together - but recently a problem had developed. She said that he had become irate about Chris Pratt, and hated the actor so strongly that he would go on hour-long rants about how terrible he is. The woman said that the problem reached a new height when her boyfriend discovered that the actor would star in the new Mario movie, and his reaction was so severe that she was now considering leaving him. What do you think about the boyfriendaposs actions  Let us know in the comments Taking to Reddit, the woman said: My boyfriendaposs unhealthy hatred of Chris Pratt is affecting our relationship.We have dated for years and he is so sweet and innocent. However, the one thing I canapost stand is how much he talks about hating Chris Pratt.He hated him in Parks and Recreation and even more in s of the Galaxy. Any mention of him always brings him in a bad mood and thataposs why he refuses to watch movies like Jurassic World, Lego Movie, and onward.Things went from bad to worse for the woman when the new animated Super Mario Bros film was announced, and it emerged that Chris Pratt would be the voice of the Italian plumber.She continued: He is a huge Nintendo fan and was looking forward to the Mario movie. When he heard Chris Pratt would be voicing Mario though he had a tantrum where he ended up breaking his Switch as a result. I tried to calm him down but he childishly accused me of supporting Chris Prattand ordered me to leave once I did not agree with his rants.

Heaposs sweet on other topics but Iaposm not sureI can deal with this behaviour anymore. After sharing her story online, other Reddit users were quick to offer advice to the woman. One said: There’s some sort of mental health issue going on here. This isn’t normal, but it is so out there and out of place otherwise that there has to be some sort of underlying condition. And another added: My uncle used to go on hour-long rants about trivial shit too, but he was bipolar and it was a facet of his illness. Your boyfriendaposs behaviour might be more understandablehe were struggling with some mental health issues. He either needs to figure out why this is such an intense issue for him and sort it out or stop talking about it entirely before he ruins his relationship.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

But one couple recently discovered a apossecretapos room hidden behind a wall in their house. Sarah King and her husband Toby were giving their property in Brighton a fresh lick of paint when they came across the faint outline of a doorway. Sarah, , said: We knew there was a void there, from the plans. The other houses along the road have got a cupboard therebut we had thought ours was completely bricked up.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.However, while prepping and sanding the walls of their dining room, they came across the outline and had to knowthere was anything more to the space. With Sarah still furloughed but Toby out at work as a technical support engineer, she had some free time on her hands. He went to work one day and I started chipping away the surface just to seethere was any way of finding out what was there, she explained. I just did a tiny bit then sent a photo to Toby - he was replying and happy for me to discover more. As I uncovered the lintel, I realised that it was not resting on the breeze blocks that were blocking the door. They weren’t supporting anything above.  Throughout the process, I was sending updates to Toby, who was cheering me on and friends and family too, who were getting excited to see what I would find in there! Sarah, who has recently launched her own interior design business, managed to chip through the wall and knew there was a room there, but held back until Toby finished work. Sarah said: I waited until Toby was home to make the final hit to smash down the breeze blocks – in case something was staring back at me! It was a tiny room with just a pull-out shelf desk, some knee pads and a car battery. It had electricity to it and believe it or not, hardly any cobwebs and thankfully no spiders. Once they found the room, the couple decided it was the perfect space for a bar area to entertain guests, as it sits just off their dining room. So they have transformed it into their dream bar for just £, mainly using materials they already had at home. The pair had just started work on renovating their dining room and decided to use the same paint in the bar. They then made cupboards for the wall with leftover wood they had from another project and also made a bar top from offcuts and wrapped it in marble effect vinyl. They added new handles to the cabinets and stuck mirror stickers to the back of the bar area to create a mottled glass look.To finish the whole thing off they managed to nab some glass shelves from Facebook Market place for free - bargain!Sarah added: We love it! We are so pleased with it and we love the story behind it of uncovering the space.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

You’ve got Harry Potter’s stag, Luna Lovegood’s hare, Albus Dumbledore’s phoenix and Ron Weasley’s...well...terrier. For those not in the know, a patronus is a defensive spell that produces a glowing silveranimal. Each wizard has their own unique creature although these can change in certain cases such as during bereavement or falling in love. For as long as Harry Potter has been in our lives, there has always been debate surrounding what Ron Weasley’s patronus actually is with the majority believing that it is a Jack Russell.A quick Google will even point you to a multitude of fan-run wiki pages and websites, many detailing this particular breed of dog as Ron’sso it’s no surprise that so many of us have simply accepted this to be the truth.But Ron’s actual patronus is, in fact, a Crup.  Ron is pure bloodand lives in a magical community so when you think about it, he wouldn’t have a domestic muggle animal as his patronus, he would have a magical one. So what is a Crup  In J.K Rowling’s world, a Crup is a wizarding breed of dog that looks deceptively similar to a Jack Russell, apart from one defining feature - a forked tail.According to the Fantastic Beasts website : “The Crup originated in the southeast of England. It closely resembles a Jack Russell terrier, except for the forked tail.“The Crup is almost certainly a wizard-created dog, as it is intensely loyal to wizards and ferocious towards Muggles. It is a great scavenger, eating anything from gnomes to old tyres. Crup licences may be obtained from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures on completion of a simple test to prove the applicant wizard is capable of controlling the Crup in Muggle-inhabited areas. “Crup owners are legally obliged to remove the Crup’s tail with a painless Severing Charm while the Crup is six to eight weeks old, lest Muggles notice it.” TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal. Make sharing the cutest photos of your dog your first job on the website and after youaposve done that, leave a tip to help fellow dog owners live their best lives as a proud pooch parent. Search through hundreds of recommended walks, treats, toys and places to stay when youaposre on an adventure together. From dog-friendly pubs to product reviews and the latest news, you can snf it all out at TeamDogs. So, you can see where the confusion lies - for what is the dference between a Crup with a snipped tail and a run of the mill Jack Russell. To add to the uncertainty, in the film adaption of the Order of the Phoenix, Ron’s patronus is portrayed as a Jack Russell Terrier. In the books it is only mentioned as ‘a terrier’. While J.K Rowling herself described Ron’s patronus as being ‘like a Jack Russell’ - notice the ‘like’. This leaves us with one outstanding dilemma, just how would a wizard be able to tell the dference between a Crup and a Jack Russell  It turns out, without the forked tail there is no dference. When shown in Hagridaposs Care of Magical Creatures class, the narrator describes it as aposindistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tailapos.

As a consequence, the  United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP, will welcome world leaders, ministers, and other high-level officials including The Queen, to discuss climate issues. The conference, which takes place from October ,  until November , , includes multiple events that attract people from the business sector, fossil fuel companies, climate activists and more.   The  Paris Agreement required Parties to help limit the increase in global temperatures to well below  degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to . degrees. This year, the COP could not have come at a more crucial time. What will happen at COP  The official website for the COP has underlined four key points to be addressed during the meetings: . Securing global net zero by mid-century and keeping . degrees within reach.With this in mind, countries will be asked to come forward with ambitious  emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century.  To deliver on these stretching targets, countries will need to:accelerate the phase-out of coal curtail deforestation speed up the switch to electric vehicles encourage investment in renewables.. Adapting to protect communities and natural habitats.This will mean Parties will need to work together to enable and encourage countries affected by climate change to:protect and restore ecosystems build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and even lives. Mobilising finance in order to deliver the COP’s first two goals.This will mean that developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least  billion in climate finance per year by . . Parties will be required to work together to rise to the challenges of the climate crisis.They will therefore:finalise the Paris Rulebookaccelerate action to tackle the climate crisis through collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society.  Why does COP matter  The world is now facing unprecedented dangers related to climate change, such as floods, storms, and other environmental hazards. Furthermore, the IPCC gathered the observations of scientists who have confirmed that the Earth’s climate in every region and across the whole climate system, was directly affected by human’s activity, leading to continued sea level rise. Nevertheless, the IPCC has also revealed that strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxideand other greenhouse gases would limit climate change. At the COP, participating Parties are due to finalise their national action plans to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement, and therefore limit global warming to C above pre-industrial levels to curb the climate crisis. According to Friends of the Earth , this year’s COP, which was delayed due to COVID- restrictions, is a vital event because the window of opportunity to remain under that crucial . degrees of planetary warming is getting smaller and smaller with each passing year.  FOEaposs director of campaigning impact, Jamie Peters, told Sky News: “Itaposs particularly important to the UK because, as host, all eyes will be looking at what the UK is actually doing,rather than what it says. As one of the nations most responsible for climate change, due to historic pollution, there will be a world focus on the UKaposs role in responding to it - as well as how these talks are chaired.” The th UN Climate Change Conference will take place at the Scottish Event Campusin Glasgow.

The Well of Barhout in Yemen is shunned by many locals who believe it is a source of eternal bad luck. Located in Yemen’s eastern province of Al-Mahra, the enormous hole in the desert floor spans ft wide and plunges a staggering ft below ground. The cave, thought to be millions of years old, is said to give of strange odours - with tales of the damned and aposnonbelieversapos being sent there in an afterle. A team of Omani explorers decided to explore what really lay at the bottom of the mysterious wonder - making the eerie descent to its floor. Mohammed al-Kindi, a geology professor at the German University of Technology in Oman, told AFP: There were snakes, but they won’t bother you unless you bother them. “Some say it is where apostates and nonbelievers are tortured after death. Others believe that their heads would be severed once they’re down there.” The team of cavers collected samples from its depts, and shed more light on what lay waiting for them at the bottom.  Prof al-Kindi added: We collected samples of water, rocks, soil and some dead animals but have yet to have them analysed. “We noticed strange things inside. We also smelled something strange … It’s a mysterious situation.” Stunning images from inside the cave show millions of years of sedimentary rock circling its walls. Light pouring in from the entrance also appears to illuminate the caveaposs surface, creating a shimmering, luminescent effect. A report of the teamaposs full findings is due to be made public when finalised.

Marcie and Brad Ball said the cost of hotels drove them to look for an alternative, and Marcie estimates that they will save at least £ per night on holidays and a huge £, per year. The couple, currently living in Las Vegas, US, purchased the old yellow school bus in March last year for £ [], before spending another £, on renovations. Their children, Addison, , William, , Abram, , Oliver, , Logan, , Preston, , and Carson, , were thrilled to see their dad pull up in the bus. The stay at home mum-of-seven said: Our bus signicantly reduces the costs of our family trips. We love to travel but with so many kids it is really dficult to get a hotel room for us all, and we are usually forced to have to pay for two rooms. Which is so much more costly and also means we have to split up as a family. Since having the bus that we can travel in and all sleep in, it means we can all stay together and save at least £ per night on hotels, sometimes, even more, depending on the area. We currently take probably two cross-country trips and several closer-by trips equalling about  nights each year. So we save at least £, a year in total or even a bit more than that.  Our bus takes away the stress of booking and paying for hotels, we can just jump in and go. The kids have a blast and it gives us such great quality family time together. Brad, who works in construction in the US Air Force, spent four months renovating the bus so it was fit for his familyaposs holidays. The bus now has a space for each of the family members to sleep, including three hammocks for some of the children.  Marcie said: I was sceptical when Brad first mentioned buying a bus because I just couldnapost picture what it would end up like, but I just let him run with the idea and I am so glad I did. I absolutely love the bus now and I love using it. People always ask about it and want to take pictures. They canapost believe we all fit in it.  The kids are also crazy about it. They love to sleep in the hammocks, they fight over who gets to sleep in them. The bus is also so helpful because we like to go camping too, and setting up the camp and tents takes such a long time because there are so many of us. So the bus takes away that stress too. Marcie, who home schools her children, says that the bus also gives them more freedom as they can get up and go.  She added: If we want to go on a trip we can just pack up and getaway. And I can take the kidaposs books with us and we can do homeschooling on the road. It just gives us the ultimate freedom. When my husband retires from the Air Force we would love to go travelling as a family for a year. Iaposm so happy we decided to do this, itaposs saved us time and money, and we have made the best family memories.

The two plastic containers are similar in size, and as neither of them were wearing their glasses at the time, it was reported.  At the time of the incident, Regina tilted her head back and opened her eyes wide as her boyfriend squeezed what he thought was her eye drops directly into her eye. She said: The moment the drops hit my eye, I felt an intense burning sensation. I thought my eye was going to explode.  She was taken to a local hospital, where doctors used a serum and cotton to try to alleviate her pain. Ophthalmologist Liana Tito told UOL: When chemical products such as superglue, or even alcohol gel, which happens quite frequently, fall in the eye region, the eyelid can be affected by chemical burns. She added that the burns can also affect the cornea and conjunctiva. Regina was discharged the same day, but she said the pain made it impossible for her to sleep. She said: I had tears running down my cheeks all night. The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions. If for some reason these lesions evolve, they cause bacterial ulcers and then become lesions with imminent risks of perforation and blindness. She then paid another visit to the ophthalmologist, who reopened her eye and used scissors and tweezers to try to remove the traces of superglue. The doctor explained: The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions. It is not clearshe will suffer any long-term damage to her eye.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Hospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jitender Gogi, one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters who was involved in several criminal cases and jailed at Tihar since last year, was one of those fatally shot inside Rohini court. He was transported to hospital, where he was declared dead.According to reports fromNDTV India , the two other men killed in the crossfire involving the gang members and police , were gangsters who had come to the court intending to kill Gogi.Both the attackers, reportedly named Rohit and Morish, had dressed as lawyers before barging into an ongoing hearing in Court Room No.  to shoot Gogi, who was from a rival group going by the name ‘Tillu gang’. As soon as Gogi entered the same room, both the attackers started firing at him. Police then retaliated, shooting and killing them on the spot. According to an eyewitness, a female law intern also sustained bullet injuries as a result of the crossfire. Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana told NDTV that two people from a rival gang had opened fire at Jitender Gogi, prompting police to retaliate and shoot the two assailants. “The police acted swtly and killed both the assailants. Total three dead, including Gogi,” said Mr Asthana. The incident marks a huge security lapse on court premises. Questions had incidentally been raised about whether metal detectors at the court were working andthey were, how the armed men could get past. “We are already investigating the case and we shall not spare anyone who is involved in this shootout. No one will be spared,” Mr Asthana said. He added: “Delhi Police is doing its job seriously. We were effective and focused and that is why the shooter was successfully neutralised. We will say more after a detailed investigation is carried out.” Tillu gang and Gogi’s gang had reportedly been at war for years. More than  people had reportedly died in their clashes. Gogi, born Jitender Mann, was arrested in March last year and was considered a big catch for the Delhi police.

followed by a stratospheric rise from one of the most successful singer-songwriters ever to emerge from Scotland.Indeed, such was the impact Emeli Sande made on the music world when her first single was released a decade ago that she was performing at the opening and closing ceremonies at the London Olympics less than a year later.Not bad for the self-confessed #very shy, nerdy and extremely well-behaved# pupil who attended Alford Academy and developed a love of music and creating her own work.There have been myriad honours, prizes and accolades from her peers, the public and the glitterati, both in Britain and across the globe, and an MBE for her services to music, after she honed her talents while growing up in Aberdeenshire in the s.But she has never strayed too far from the down-to-earth philosophy of composing her own songs and collaborating with others to make a joyful noise.It helped that she was encouraged to pursue her dreams by her parents, Joel and Diane, after they moved to the north-east of Scotland from Sunderland when she was a child.Those who remember the youngster in her formative years describe her as quiet but conscientious, introverted but creative# a person who took her studies seriously but whose fascination with making music was obvious.She penned her first song at the age of  for a primary-school talent show and later recalled: #I always knew that I wanted to be a musician and I knew I wanted to write because the people I was listening to all wrote.#I never thought it was an option to sing anybody #s songs.#However, at the outset of her professional career, Emeli seemed to prefer working with other artists than striking out on her own, not that it did her any harm.She first rose to prominence after being featured on the  Chipmunk track Diamond Rings.It was their first top  single, then she was featured on Never Be Your Woman by the rapper Wiley, which was another major success in the following year.Still only in her early s, there are pictures of her on the keyboards at a gig at The Lemon Tree in Aberdeen, where she received a rapturous reception from the crowd.She was clearly in her element, whipping up a storm with a series of catchy melodies, which were part of her efforts to take centre stage and build her own repertoire.And, once Heaven was released in the autumn of , the torch paper had been lit. A new star was in the ascendancy and she was about to take the world by storm.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed yQqdOaLg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenA single-minded inidual, Emeli decided to go to university in Glasgow rather than rush into pursuing what could have been ephemeral popularity in the pop world.She also chose not to use her original birth name, Adele, given the fact she had noticed another talented woman had rather claimed it as her own.She explained: #I changed it as soon as Adele . I just thought: #You#ve kind of taken thenow#, so I went with my middle name.#She was just getting bigger and bigger, so I thought I really need .#Her first solo single was the start of an astonishing period in Emeli#s le.Heaven was showered with positive reviews and the momentum around her built up like a snowball rolling down a hill and sparking an avalanche.Within the next three months, she achieved her maiden No  single in the UK singles chart when Read All About It entered at the very top of the pile.Then, on November , she performed at the LG ARENA in Birmingham, was named as the Brit Awards Critics# Choice for  the following month and her hit-studded debut album, Our Version of Events, reached No  shortly after its release in February .Even notoriously hard-to-please critics were positive in their reviews for the work, which eventually sold more than five million copies # a remarkable number in the age of streaming # and was described as a collection of richly melodic, classically powerful, and retro-futurist soul-pop songs, with nods to Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and others.And, as the phone kept ringing and her reputation soared, there was communication between her representatives and the organisers of the London Olympics.It seems like an awfully long time since a genuine feelgood factor engulfed Britain during the triumphant staging of the Games, which offered a warm welcome to an international audience and provided abundant moments of joy.On July , Emeli rose to the occasion when she sang Abide with Me at the opening ceremony, while the ubiquitous Heaven was used to accompany the section with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the man who invented the Internet.It was a stunning illustration of her meteoric rise and she subsequently performed Read All About Itat the closing ceremony a fortnight later, while a video montage of emotional scenes from the spectacular event was screened in London.She also recorded a version of John Lennon#s classic song, Imagine, for the BBC, who used it for their climactic montage at the conclusion of their Olympic coverage.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed Yamo-PtWVo featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenIf anybody imagined that Emeli was a transient phenomenon, she dispelled that concern by continuing to expand her horizons and conquering the US market.The latter accomplishment was celebrated in style when she performed at the White House as one of the featured artists at the award ceremony in  when Barack Obama presented Carole King with the Library of Congress Gershwin Medal.A few months later, she started writing her second album, Long Live the Angels, whose painstaking progress reaped idends when it debuted at No  in the UK chart in .Given the scale of her success worldwide and especially in the UK and the US, Emeli has been a presence in many important campaigns.Whether through her performances at fundraising concerts or launching initiatives of her own, she has backed up her lyrics of social change and equality with direct action.Following her performance at Sir Elton John#s Aids Foundation Event back in , she has offered whole-hearted support in raising money for and awareness of the HIV Aids blight, which is still a massive problem in many countries throughout the African continent, including her father#s birthplace in Zambia.But she has never forgotten her roots and talked about how her le had changed and her response to tackling social issues when she ed to Aberdeen in .Emeli responded to the horror of terrorist attacks at several music events and arts festivals in  with a sense of mounting incredulity and shock.But, as she prepared to make her first-ever appearance at Aberdeen’s old AECC venue four years ago, her message was: “It’s a scary world, but let’s all make music together.”She was as horried as everyone  by the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert, which killed  people in Manchester in May , but she told me she was convinced that music had the power to heal ision and break down barriers.“These things are horric, but as a musician, I hope I can bring people closer together.“That’s why we do what we do. And, by starting this tour in Aberdeen, I also hope I can say thanks to so many of the people who helped me get to where I am today.”In  Emeli announced the release of her third album, Real Le, following what was described as an intense personal journey of self-doubt and discovery.It was more reflective and downbeat than her previous works, but the track Extraordinary Being was part of the soundtrack for the film X-Men # Dark Phoenix.She was also involved in a BBC Scotland show, Emeli Sande#s Street Symphony, meeting and collaborating with a iety of artists in a four-part documentary series.Everything was placed on hiatus during the Covid pandemic, but she hasn#t been idle behind the scenes and has just confirmed that a new album is on the way.Oh, and there#s a fizzing single, Family, which shows she hasn#t lost her groove.mdash Emeli SandéSeptember , Emeli Sande is the most internationally-renowned singer-songwriter to emerge from the north-east since Annie Lennox burst into the spotlight with The Tourists and Eurythmics  years ago.They share some of the same characteristics: both are fiercely independent, passionate about championing causes close to their heart, and creating idiosyncratic music.Yet while Annie has moved far from where she grew up in the s, Emeli has maintained her connection with her roots and makes no apology for doing so.Hopefully, as the world opens up again in the future, we can all get the chance to commemorate her decade of achievement at the PJ Live!For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/Stuck-in-rent-featured-image2-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":"We’ve put together a collection of daily updated charts to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.

It certainly helps that he knows the team well, and everybody knows him.“There’s a big respect there. It’s now just all about sticking together and working hard to try and get the results we want for the coming season.”As well as continuing to play, former Inverness Caley Thistle and Dundee man Meekings is keen to contribute as a coach.He added: “I’m looking forward to trying to give a bit of experience that I’ve had to the players.“We’ve got a few young boys on loan from Ross County and Inverness, so hopefully I can give them my experience and try to help them throughout training.“I’m looking forward to it, it’s exciting times.“I love football – that’s the main thing.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

which runs the sites.Around one in six adults in Britain said they were not able to buy essential food items at some point during the past two weeks due to products not being available, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics.The Transport Secretary has tried to dissuade drivers from panic buying petrol, although there have been chaotic scenes at petrol stations across the country.Grant Shapps said on Friday that motorists should ldquocarry on as normal.ldquoThe advice would be to carry on as normal, and that is what BP is saying as well, he told Sky News.On Friday morning, queues started to form outside some filling stations in the UK.Photos from Maidenhead and Leeds showed cars trying to reach the pumps.Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ldquoHGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together.ldquoWithout them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops.ldquoCurrently, the UK faces a shortfall of around , HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences.ldquoUnless a solution can be found in the next  days, it is inevitable that we will see

with hundreds of business leaders this week, itrsquos clear therersquos a total mindset sht from growing to coping. This is now a major threat to our recovery and the Government needs to step up its response to a new level of both speed and boldness.ldquoWhile many of these challenges are global in nature, the solutions we need are local.He added: ldquoGovernment is right to keep up the pressure on companies to adapt and not rely on immigration long term, but temporary visas are the only way to alleviate the disruption of shortages in critical skilled parts of the economy in weeks and months instead of years.ldquoGetting skills programmes right immediately is key to ensuring that these measures are only needed temporarily.ldquoOn energy, itrsquos imperative the Government provides a facility to enable well-capitalised suppliers to absorb new customers, and energy intensive companies, which underpin critical UK supply chains, are well supported throughout the winter.ldquoEstablishing a crisis management task force to move quickly ndash with both business and Government around the table ndash will ensure Government is far more informed about the nature and scale of the challenges can formulate responses fast and is able to get the support of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to take action required.

shows that loss of smell and taste are still the most common indicators of Covid across populations from the UK, US and Israel.According to the study, someone who has lost their sense of taste and smell is  times more likely to test positive for Covid than someone without these symptoms.The analysis also showed that a high fever and shortness of breath werestrongly linked to positive Covid tests.According to the NHS website, loss of taste and smell arealsosymptoms of the common cold.Unfortunately there is a lot of crossover between the symptoms for both the common cold and Covid.If you have any symptoms related to Covid you should isolate and book a test.The NHS lists the following symptoms for the common cold:The Zoe research suggests that the most common Covid symptoms in people who have had both doses of the vaccine are:The Zoe research highlights  symptoms of Covid to look out for:Evidently Covid shares a lot of symptomswiththe common cold.The most important thing to doyou

Calmac, too, tells ferry users that they should \"only travelnecessary\". What one person regards as \"necessary\", another regards as indulgence. Nationalised services are under great pressure, and I wonder what will happen when Scottish railways are nationalised. With rail services being reduced, perhaps there will be banners at train stations saying: \"Is your journey really necessary\" Supporting services is about choices and priorities. For island dwellers, ferries are, often quite literally, a leline. In any case, why should islanders not be able to travel between home and mainland at will  We hear a lot about how Scotland could be like Denmark. Are there aged and inadequate ferries plying the waters between Danish islands, or for that matter between Scandinavian countries  I donrsquot think so.The Scottish Government spends millions on \"hubs\" in foreign countries which already have British embassies that represent Scotlandrsquos needs. Building up these hubs, and employing ministers to supervise them and the rest of SNP \"foreign policy\" is a device to build a base for a separate Scotland and to give the impression abroad that Scotland is a separate polity. What with that and providing Gaelic language instruction for the police force, among other things, a lot of money could be saved to spend on the priorities that Scots actually want, such as a ing AE service and reliable ferry links to Scottish islands.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.* IT becomes very wearisome to hear leading figures in the Scottish Government repeatedly claim or suggest that the crisis in the ambulance service in Scotland, as well as in the NHS in general and much , are all, or mostly all, attributable to the pandemic. This is utter nonsense.For more than a decade the SNP has been in charge of running our health service. In the same period it has opened \"pretendy\" embassies overseas at staggering costs for a matter that is reserved handed out a series of populist freebies and indulged in much nationalist window-dressing, such as having Gaelic signs printed on all public service vehicles buying a redundant airport nationalising a shipyard that is now a basket case on and on it goes, all of them vanity and fantasy projects, and critically absorbing our taxes, which could have gone towards properly funding our councils and providing better health care and welfare for the most vulnerable in our society. The SNP could have cut the toll of the worst drugs death rates in Europeit had put aside nationalist fervour and prioritised where our taxes are spent.This administrationrsquos record is Scottish nationalism write large: \"all fur coat and nae knickers\".Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.WHY SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE CAN I ask why independence supporters were out on the streets last Saturday Letters, September   If I asked any of them to explain to me what the economic policy for a successful independent Scotland is, what currency would be used, how a central bank would operate, what would the defence policy of an independent Scotland be, how could an independent Scotland join the EU, how would Scotlandrsquos massive deficit be reduced and the myriad of other constitutional issues, would they be able to tell me My suspicion is no, so it begs the question, why do they support independence  I know why but I would like to hear from them. When I asked an activist delivering a leaflet prior to the election what has the SNP done for Scotland, his reply was ldquobaby boxes. I was astonished. So I suspect those ldquoout on the streets would say free prescriptions, free bus travel, free this, free that, free us from Westminster, give us our freedom, Nicolarsquos wonderful ndash all emotional nonsense and not a scooby about the real and serious issues.Then Stewart Falconerwrite that an independent Scotland ldquowould be the th richest country in the world. Why settle for th when we currently are part of the fth richest country in the world ndash the best independent nation in the world, the United Kingdom  Independence would take decades to settle down , will provide high taxes, austerity never previously experienced and unemployment. The majority will save us from all of that.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.SCOTLANDS NAVY RECALLEDLIKE the rest of the UK, Scottish taxpayers pay for the British Army, whose personnel will soon be driving some of our ambulances. Neil Stewartmakes the silly comment thatScotland were independent ldquothis would not have happened, presumably because the British Army or whatever it was subsequently called, would no longer operate in Scotland. An independent Scotland would have its own army backed by a long history of military service pre and post-Union, and freed from pretensions of strutting the world stage as a bit player. Mr Stewart seems to be in a fantasy unionist world believing an independent Scotland would be a unique country by not having an army or air force for that matter.It would also have its own navy as it had from the th and th centuries, built up by James IV to  ships, around the same number the Royal Navy currently has, including the Great Michael which was reputed to be the largest ship of the time. In  during the reign of James V, the Royal Scots Navy captured the Mary Willoughby, a ship of the English Tudor Navy, which then accompanied our fleet in Europe and visits to Scottish isles, although it was re-taken by the English in . Scotland may not have been a world power but it had strong connections in Europe and was no forgotten backwater as it is today.After the Union of , the Royal Scots Navy was consigned to the historical bin. A fascinating and interesting part of Scottish history about which many of our own people remain ignorant and which in the re-telling, would provide material for producers of historical drama ndashonly they knew or even thought about it.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.WE WILL HAVE OUR OWN SOLDIERSTHERE are many valid arguments against Scottish independence, but citing the support from the British Army by Neil Stewart should not be one of them.Does Mr Stewart think that all the soldiers driving Scottish ambulances are English, Welsh or from Northern Ireland  In the event of Scotland becoming an independent country there will still be Scottish soldiers who can be called upon to support the civilian authorities in times of need. Indeed the Scottish soldier, following independence, is more likely to be based in Scotland rather than be found soldiering far away on foreign hills pursuing the imperialistic dreams of the UK Government.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh.* NEIL Stewarts letter on the merits of the British Army highlights a major issue.In the past, the force was used by the British Government to influence and negate strikes in large public sector labour disputes.The mobilisation of the British Army in the NHS crisis might yet be seen in the same context: why bother training staffthe Army can do the work at a lower cost and without any messy employment issues Allan McDougall, Neilston.RALLIES AND THE ROYAL PREROGATIVEI SEE All Under One Banner is marching in Edinburgh on Saturday to Holyrood.It reminded me of the  march when someone full of their own importance at Historic Scotland banned AUOB having a rally in Holyrood Park after the march, because it was seen as a political meeting and such meetings are not allowed in Holyrood Park.This is despite the Queen having garden parties and there being good old miners galas in the park. Both could be described as political.Anyway, I recently came across a report in an old brochure and lo and behold in  there was the biggest political gathering ever in Scotland in Holyrood Park, which, according to the Scotsman of that day, attracted a crowd of , to discuss the Parliamentary Reform Bill.If political gatherings were okay with Queen Victoria, I donrsquot see why it would be a problem today. One has to be very careful,but the current Queen surely doesnrsquot involve herself in politics, does she IB Archibald, Edinburgh.BRING SOCIAL CARE INTO THE NHSIT is not surprising that Donald Macaskill, chief executive of the commercial care industry, should argue for ldquoself-directed support for those with dementia ndash in other words, the mentally sick being funded so they can pay his mostly profit-centred members to look after them . It is this which is ldquogrotesque, to borrow his expression.I trust the Scottish Government will see through this, and will move as quickly as possible to having institutional care provided by the NHS, in publicly owned facilities.Michael Otter, Kinlochbervie.Read more: Oil once saved the UK.

In addition to our four teams, the pitch is regularly used by the universities and junior clubs in the Glasgow area. Having worked very hard to ensure we met all the protocols to allow ato Covid secure training and then Covid-secure matches at Peterson Park we were informed, just before the start of our season, that the facility was not to reopen.Fortunately, we have been able to come to a short-term arrangement with the council to allow this seasonrsquos matches to be played there and have now embarked on a longer-term plan to take over responsibility, with others, for the management of Peterson Park as a People Make Glasgow communities project.

Under Carneiro, with whom the players have clearly established a mutually admiring partnership, the arc of the whole symphony was crystal clear and details sparkled, particularly the unison string ensemble around half-way through and the brass figure towards the end that echoed both the Bach and Lindberg of the first half of the concert.Pekka Kuusito at Glasgow City Halls - credit BBC - Alan PeeblesOn paper it may have appeared that it was Kuusistorsquos show, with the second part more Carneirorsquos, but the reality was much subtler. The symphony was preceded by Beethovenrsquos Leonora No. Overture, providing an alternative bridge between Bach and Sibelius, and featuring a very perky obligato from flautist Charlotte Ashton and a reminder that this is the Scotlandrsquos best venue when offstage brass is a feature of the score.All of this also spoke to the newest work of the evening, Lindbergrsquos Violin Concerto No. of , most of which is a dialogue between soloist and the strings ndash initially a much more vexed conversation than it becomes ndash with punctuation from the reeds and horns. It has a big Sibelian moment from the latter late on, as the composer nods to his countryman, and Kuusisto was on predictably glorious form for the virtuosic cadenza.As a statement of intent from an orchestra of enormous range, this was a perfectly constructed, and immaculately played, evening that spoke volumes about how much we have been missing since March of last year.

It also provides guidance for mums and dads on testing, self-isolation, and vaccination.Read the letter in full, below. Dear parents and carers,With schools having been back for nearly four weeks, I want to commend the care, commitment and courage shown by everyone in playing their part in keeping our communities safe. The number of cases of COVID- across Orkney have been rising of late and have affected a small proportion of adults and young people who attend at some of our schools.On Monday this week, there were  positive cases linked to Stromness Academy and we now also see six positive cases at Kirkwall Grammar School.We have worked closely with Public Health colleagues in Orkney and, together, we have managed local clusters very effectively. This was only successful thanks to the diligence of parents, pupils and staff in following the mitigations in place and for managing these situations positively but cautiously.Whilst so much has changed over the past  months, the fundamentals within our schools have remained the same. Children and young people still come to school to learn, play and socialise with their friends.The easing of restrictions has left some relieved and others anxious. I want to reassure you all that staff are doing everything they can to make your child’s experience a positive one, in particular by implementing Scottish Government guidance to keep us all as safe as possible.I do understand that there will be a level of nervousness among some of you with regard to the recent transmission rates, on this basis, the Education team felt it may be helpful to share the following information with you: Mitigating measures include:• Distancing between adults and between pupils when required.A detailed list of the mitigations is published below.There has also been some confusion around testing and the dference between PCR and LFD tests. Only request a PCR test :• You are contacted by Test  ProtectLateral Flow Device Tests:• Please ensure that you log the results of your Lateral Flow Devicetest onlineyou test positive or negative, this helps give an indication of whether or not the virus is spreading. Parents who are concerned their children might have contracted Covid can complete a self-help guide on NHS Inform that will help them determinethis is the case.If you develop symptoms or you have a positive LFD test, then you must request a PCR test through the COVID Assessment Centre . To request a vaccination call:   . The COVID Assessment Centre opens at .am and closes at pm . After a positive LFD you must isolate until your PCR test confirms you are negative. If your PCR is positive there will be isolation protocols that you will have to follow the NHS Orkney team will help folk every step of the way.Unless exempt, current mitigations are:•Hygiene, Ventilation and Face Coverings • All hand and respiratory hygiene mitigations will continue to be encouraged, and an enhanced cleaning regime will continue to apply in buildings and vehicles.• Windows should continue to be opened regularly to maximise ventilation.• Face coverings will continue to be a requirement at all times for all staff and learners in secondary schools.• In primary school, all other establishments, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, children or young people.• In nurseries, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, including parents.• In primary schools, adults will also need to wear a face covering whenever they are moving around communal areas of the school, including corridors.• Only pupils aged  and over will be required to wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated school transport. Groupings and Distancing• The grouping of pupils and adults into discrete bubbles will no longer be required, but assemblies and other large gatherings will continue to be kept on hold for the time being.• There will be no requirement for children and young people to maintain physical distancing between each other, although this will continue to be encouraged in secondary schools.• The distance that adults are required to maintain from other adults, children and young people has formally been reduced to one metre, however schools will continue to encourage pupils and staff to maintain two metre distancing wherever possible. Nursery children are not required to keep a distance from adults or children in the setting.• Pupils using dedicated school transport will not be expected to maintain distancing between each other, but there will remain an expectation that drivers remain at least one metre distance from all passengers.• Parents and carers will continue to be discouraged from attending school premises except in cases where this is agreed with the school as being absolutely necessary. Vaccination, Testing and Self-Isolation• Adults and secondary pupils will be encouraged to take twice-weekly LFD tests and to record their results online.• Any adult, child or young person who develops the symptoms of COVID-, or who test positive must self-isolate immediately in line with NHS Guidance, and noty their school.• Anyone who is fully vaccinated identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any young person aged between  years and  years four months, who is not yet fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any adult aged over  years four months, who is not fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test.  They should continue to self-isolate for ten days from onset of symptoms eventhe test result is negative. • Children and young people aged from five to  will no longer be subject to a blanket requirement to self-isolate for ten daysthey are identied as a close contact by Test and Protect. Instead, they should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant. Children aged under  will be exempt from this testing.• Schools and Early Learning Childcare settings will not be required to stand down classes in the event of a positive case being identied.  They will, instead, send parents and staff a #warn and inform# letter advising them of the facts and reminding them that there is no need to self-isolate unless contacted by Test and Protect and advised otherwise.• The Chief Medical Officer advises that children and young people on the highest risk list can now follow that same advice as the rest of the population.

If people aged  and over haven’t opted out of donation, they will be considered a possible donorthey die in circumstances in which they could donate.Under the opt out system everyone has a choice — to be a donor, or opt out of donation — but it’s important to make that decision known.In Scotland, there are an average of around  people currently waiting on an organ transplant, however only around one per cent of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible.Scotland#s public health minister, Maree Todd, said: “Over half of adults have now recorded their donation decision — the highest percentage in the UK.“Donation remains a personal decision and everyone has a choice.  We are committed to continuing to raise awareness of the choices people have under the opt out system and the importance of making their donation decision known.“I would encourage people to make a decision about donation, record their decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register and tell their family and friends, so they know what you would want to happen.“We have made tremendous progress in increasing donation and transplantation in Scotland over the last decade, with the move to opt out part of a package of measures to reduce the number of people in Scotland waiting for a transplant at any one time.”Folk can register here: https:www.organdonationscotland.org .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is now a major threat to our recovery and the Government needs to step up its response to a new level of both speed and boldness.ldquoWhile many of these challenges are global in nature, the solutions we need are local.He added: ldquoGovernment is right to keep up the pressure on companies to adapt and not rely on immigration long term, but temporary visas are the only way to alleviate the disruption of shortages in critical skilled parts of the economy in weeks and months instead of years.ldquoGetting skills programmes right immediately is key to ensuring that these measures are only needed temporarily.ldquoOn energy, itrsquos imperative the Government provides a facility to enable well-capitalised suppliers to absorb new customers, and energy intensive companies, which underpin critical UK supply chains, are well supported throughout the winter.ldquoEstablishing a crisis management task force to move quickly ndash with both business and Government around the table ndash will ensure Government is far more informed about the nature and scale of the challenges can formulate responses fast and is able to get the support of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to take action required. We stand ready to support the Government to do this.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On st April , Lachie was appointed as the first member of staff and director and went on to become the chief executive officer.: #At that time, the association had built four houses for affordable rent in Glendale. It now has a housing portfolio of  affordable rent and  shared equity properties.#In addition to the affordable housing stock, Lachie has expanded the association’s range of services beyond our tenants to the wider community by taking over the responsibility of the care and repair service from Shelter and establishing the handyperson service — the first in Scotland # to assist our elderly folk in Lochalsh and Skye remain at home for as long as is reasonably possible.#He also established our innovative energy advice service for the wider community to reduce household fuel costs.#He added: ”Through Lachie’s leadership, the association has grown from one to  members of staff who all have the highest regard and respect for this man.“I have never heard a bad word said about Lachie, either from the staff, the board or within the community in which he serves.#While unaware of Mr McIvor#s praise, Lachie was quick to commend his colleagues for their important contributions to those achievements.#We have a fantastic staff team # we really are blessed. None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’. I will take a rest and recharge my batteries but then I will have a look at what the future holds.”Mr McIvor added: #On a personal note, I am proud to have known Lachie for over  years as my director and then chief executive officer.#He is also a true friend, as are his family, and through his guidance, support and good humour, I am a better person for knowing Lachie MacDonald.#I have no doubt in my mind that this could be said by anyone who has met this remarkable and modest man.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flora-Mac-Innes-with-husband-Norman-and-other-family-members.jpg","title":"hebridean history families reunited by the sound of a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn one astonishing example, that happened just after the launch of Tobar an Dualchais, a man whose father had died in the Second World War before he was born was able to hear his father’s voice for the first time.For most of us, we can only imagine what that must have been like: strangely recognisable phrases and subtle mannerisms or turns of phrase, along with deeper thoughts of how things might have been dferent…Whatever the case, we can be sure that for those who are able to reconnect or gain greater insight through the recordings of friends and family members long after they have passed is truly extraordinary and deeply personal.My mother, IsabelMacKenzie, had one of these experiences when she attended an event hosted by TAD in Lochboisdale in ..She of course immediately recognised her voice, although it had been some  years since her mother’s death.I never got to meet my grandmother. She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing.

It also covers people’s post-pandemic plans for their dog such as are they hoping to take them into the office with them or will they employ a dog walker,they are ing to their workplace.The survey, which can be completed online at www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk, also asks people to say how having a dog improves their le, what advice they would give to people looking to welcome a dog into their family and what one thing could Dogs Trust do to help them and their dog live happily together.Conor adds:“We always love to hear tales from owners who have adopted from us, and every single one of them has a dferent story to tell.

An emphatic yes,” said Secretary Clinton.“I’ve always enjoyed being on university campus, talking with students and faculties, learning about their experiences and perspectives, but Queen’s is special, a university with global reach and local impact. A first class research institution, a centre for innovation and entrepreneurship in technology, business and health, an incubator for artists and activists. I’m looking forward to learning much more about this university’s exciting story and about the future you will create together.“But there was another reason why I agreed to become a member of this community,” she continued.

Bill and I were here to do what we could to support the search for peace, and to light the Christmas tree at City Hall.“It was also the first time I visited Queen’s for a reception right here in Whitla Hall. Representatives of the ious factions were here too. As I remember, the Catholic leadership stood by the band, Protestants stood by the food. It is fitting that today we are all together honouring a group of women who reached across those long-held isions to help make peace real, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition.Women like Bronagh Hinds, Professor Monica McWilliams, Jane Morrice, Pearl Sagar OBE. They formed their own political party in  in order to participate in the formal peace negotiations. Women did not have a seat at the table. A quarter century of bloodshed and stre and embedded sexism had discouraged most women from politics, but they were relentless in their commitment to peace. They had a great slogan too, ‘Wave Goodbye to the Dinosaurs’.“Throughout my career as First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, some of my most cherished memories are moments spent with the remarkable women of Northern Ireland, all waving away those dinosaurs.“Women like the late Pat Hume, a gracious, determined force behind the peace deal.“Women wanted the same things,” said Secretary Clinton.“Good jobs, good schools for their children, streets you could walk down safely, a future you could believe in.“But even here in Northern Ireland, the peace and progress so many worked tirelessly to achieve is incomplete.“The work of integration in housing and schools is far from finished.“Neighbourhoods remain ided. Poverty and unemployment persist. The dficulties of the past continue to threaten the present.“Divisions over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol and proposed amnesty legislation might very well undermine a peaceful future.“A future that people voted for, fought for, and even died for.”Mrs Clinton said it remains for the people of Northern Ireland to shape the future.“I don’t pretend to have the political answers to resolve this impasse. That is up to the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But I do know this, the future of Northern Ireland will be determined by the power of communities coming together, like the one here at Queen’s.“Many of the students here today were born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed. They study together, play sports and join clubs together. They have long, deep conversations late into the night. These may be simple interactions but when considered in the context of Northern Ireland’s history, the idea of young Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists, loyalists and republicans being one another’s friends, classmates and mentors shows it’s clear these relationships are transformative.”Mrs Clinton said the Good Friday Agreement remains a testament to the courage and faith of the people of Northern Ireland.“But we cannot take it for granted,” she warned.“Seamus Heaney said that sometimes people leave aside their cynicism, their bitterness, their hatreds, and hope and history rhyme. That is the choice the people of Northern Ireland made in .“I sincerely hope it is the choice you and countless others around the world will continue to make.“Peace is a process, not an event. Seamus Heaney also told us to believe a further shore us reachable from here.“The work here at Queen’s is far from finished but we can see that further shore,” she said.“Let us reach towards it together and prove to the world once again that we still live in a time when hope and history rhyme.”Mrs Clinton was appointed to the role for a five-year term in early  but her official installation was delayed due to the Covid- pandemic.As Mrs Clinton took part in the installation procession, a number of anti-war protesters, who had gathered outside, hurled insults and abuse.The ceremony also saw honorary degrees awarded to  leading figures in the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education in Northern Ireland.Among recipients were Derry Girls writer and creator Lisa McGee, former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Sir George Hamilton and Ireland’s highest-capped female athlete, international hockey player Shirley McCay..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumDr Gail McConnell pens poetry book about coming to terms with father’s Troubles death PremiumRelentless cyber attacks on NI Civil Service uncoveredPopular writer Stewart Love who penned one of the first Troubles-related plays dies at Coronavirus NI: Students getting vaccinated will help ease disruption to their lives, says health minister as ‘jabbathon’ continuesTrial from Queen’s University leads to improved and money-saving way to treat eye diseaseMost Read‘Take the green glasses off’: Sinn Fein and DUP clash as debate over airshow gets heatedVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontVaz did enormous harm to me and my career, reveals NI victim of bullying MPAnti-gay ex-IRA man Gerry McGeough punched at Pride parade to protest at new LGBTQ event in OmaghRihanna’s Reign: The farmer, the topless dancer, the boxer who never threw a dig and that wrap party –  years on from infamous NI video shootTop VideosPlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopeLatest Northern IrelandNI woman who received first ever vaccine is given booster jabLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasSwann calls in the troops: Health Minister’s request for army assistance grantedHiggins has ‘set back north-south relations’ by not attending centenary serviceGrandmother who had world’s first Covid jab receives booster shotLatestDuchess ‘saddened’ at death of ‘another innocent young woman on our streets’Jurors begin deliberations in R Kelly sex trafficking trialFirms will ‘sell lead off their roof’ before letting people go, says Manufacturing NI bossVaradkar: % mica redress scheme remains on the tableHuawei boss could be freed after deal with US Justice Department,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two things I would consider successful would be to have a normal weight and children. I don’t have either.”As he ages, Nolan revealed he is more and more worried about his health. Several years ago, the presenter managed to reduce his weight from  stone to , but has since put most of it back on.“I’m a complete failure with my health. Weight has defeated me and continues to defeat me,” he said.“No matter how hard I drive myself in other things, I’m a total and absolute failure with my weight. It gets me down, it worries me. Now I’m getting older, it worries me even more. I can’t beat it.

I don’t think people in London should just be on the BBC’s Top Ten earning list. You should be able to sit in Northern Ireland, or in any of the nations, and punch in big figures,” he said.He also revealed libel suits have been filed against two more iniduals he claims abused him online.Nolan, recently awarded large sums totalling more than £, after successful actions against two other internet “trolls”, vowed he will spend money going after people he believes are trying to destroy him.A writ has been issued in the High Court in Belfast against a Northern Ireland-based businesswoman, while the second claim will be in the High Court in Dublin against an estate agent based in the Republic of Ireland, Paul Tweed, his solicitor, told the Sunday Times.Mr Tweed also represented former First Minister Arlene Foster, who was awarded £, damages over a tweet by Christian Jessen, the presenter of Channel ’s Embarrassing Bodies“I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to be this rich guy going after people, but I’m as vulnerable as anyone ,” he said. “Rather than buy a new car I will spend my money going after somebody who has set out to destroy me.”He added: “I get a lot of abuse about my presentation style. That’s acceptable. I get a lot of abuse about my weight. I talk about it, so there we go.“But when someone threatens to put a bullet in your head ... I let that go for a while, then I thought, ‘No’. When there are people setting out to destroy me, and that is their sole aim ... In the past I would have turned a blind eye to that. I’m proactively going after them now.”His vow comes ahead of the second reading of a bill to update the law to bring it more into line with England, where reforms were introduced in  amid concerns London had become a libel destination for plaintfs from ious parts of the world.

Staff pictured inside the North West Regional Colleges redeveloped Springtown campus.  John Cartin, deputy head of training and skills at NWRC said: “This signicant investment in Springtown by the Department for the Economy has created a modern and vibrant learning environment for the benefit of all the college’s students, staff and stakeholders. “NWRC has a long tradition in developing the careers of men and women working in traditional crafts and skills, forging strong partnerships with local schools, groups and industry.     “But despite our rich history, we continue to be forward thinkers as we continually develop our curriculum, responding to the demands of industry and the ever-changing world of technology. “We are delighted that as part of the redevelopment of Springtown to have recruited a number of new staff members to complement our highly skilled lecturing team. These staff join us after years of valued experience working in their respective industry areas, ensuring the delivery of all aspects of the college curriculum is always up to date. “This investment in Springtown is a huge step forward and everyone at the college is enthusiastic about our new and modern estate, which has a fresh and vibrant appeal. It is not only fit for purpose, but it also meets the expectations of students and employers alike. “The work on site has seen the campus transformed. Springtown now has new workshops for each vocational area which are fitted with the latest technology and equipment that provide an enhanced learner experience. “Other exciting developments include the new CNC technology in both engineering and construction robotic welding capability, electric vehicle training rigs and charging stations, electrical testing and inspection rigs and much more.” With a wide and ied curriculum, Springtown has guided thousands of local learners studying both part-time and full-time courses, into careers in the crafts and skills sector.

Ruairi Gallagher practices with the chop saw while being supervised by lecturer Gavin Campbell.  Mr Cartin continued: “Interest in apprenticeships in all areas continues to grow and we are regularly in contact with employers across the North West whose businesses are in urgent need of skilled workers in areas such as fabrication and welding, bricklaying and carpentry and joinery. “Recently, the college ran another hugely successful Welding Academy which had almost  applications for just  places. “The college is working with local companies Fleming Agri, GES, Crossland, AE Global and SGS NI Ltd, who provided training to the participants, and such was the success which led to each of the  participants who finished the Academy with the offer of employment. “The Assured Skills Welding Academy is just one example of how training at NWRC offers a fantastic opportunity for new talent to progress in industry by addressing the skills shortage.Their success in turn, can have a positive impact on the North West City Region’s local economy by feeding into local business anchors.” Highlighting the college’s achievements at competition level Mr Cartin said the college’s huge success at Worldskills , had been very motivating for staff and students. He added: “Not only has Springtown, and our colleagues at our sister campus in Greystone Limavady, celebrated students who have gone on to the world finals and travelled across the globe to compete, many of our lecturers have also been recognised for their world-class expertise in teaching in their fields. “It’s testament to our success that a number of our staff have worked as training managers for the World Skills Team UK. “With the challenges that  has brought to all colleges – NWRC is looking ahead to the - academic year and getting back to what it does best – teaching students on site. Karen Moore, head of quality enhancement at NWRC and chair of the NI FE Colleges Covid Champions Group said: “From the beginning of September, signicant work has been undertaken across the college estates to make the necessary changes to ensure the safeto campus.

We are also encouraging students to use lateral flow tests as an extra precaution. Over the next weeks, staff will be onsite to provide students with advice and information about the vaccine and how to remain Covid safe while on campus. “We have been working in partnership with the Public Health Authority and local health trusts to ensure students have the best access to the vaccine and the ‘Jabathon’, with over  further education sites available, means students will not have far to go to get jabbed as the new academic year begins. We are very pleased to be playing our part in the Covid- fight back and look forward to welcoming our health colleagues onto our campuses to help get the jab done.” “Our new industrial training facility at Springtown is an extremely positive and welcome development of industrial apprenticeships in the college, city and region,”  Plastering student Mark McCorkell at work in Springtown.

The decision comes following allegations of the former Derry  Strabane councillor of spreading misinformation regarding the Covid- pandemic. Although she had retired from practicing medicine back in , she ed to work to help NHS staff during the Covid crisis. googletag.cmd.push However, during that time, she had posted online about her scepticism of lockdowns and how serious the virus was to peoples lives. One post likened the vaccines administration to that of work done by the Nazis who experimented on humans in concentration camps. Dr McCloskey also featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been “coerced, bribed or bullied” into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were “malevolent”. The GMC said: “The tribunal directed an -month interim suspension but all such restrictions are kept under regular review while a full investigation is carried out. “Doctors are unable to practice medicine in the UK while interim suspended. “These tribunals do not determine the facts of what happened, but undertake a risk assessment of whether temporary protection is needed.” The GMC investigated former Aontuacute councillor Dr McCloskey following a complaint made by Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP. She said: “I requested the General Medical Council to consider two social media videos posted by a Derry GP. It is essential that medical professionals provide patients and the general public with the best possible advice with regard to vaccinations. There is overwhelming evidence that vaccinations provide protection against the worst effects of Covid.     “I am extremely concerned that anti-vaccination and Covid denying propaganda is discouraging some of our population from being vaccinated. That is extremely damaging to the health of our population. “Derry continues to have a very high rate of Covid infection and the North of Ireland as a whole continues to suffer from a comparatively low vaccination rate. The medical profession obviously has a key role in tackling these issues.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Thursday, rd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

The decision comes following allegations of the former Derry  Strabane councillor of spreading misinformation regarding the Covid- pandemic. Although she had retired from practicing medicine back in , she ed to work to help NHS staff during the Covid crisis. googletag.cmd.push However, during that time, she had posted online about her scepticism of lockdowns and how serious the virus was to peoples lives. One post likened the vaccines administration to that of work done by the Nazis who experimented on humans in concentration camps. Dr McCloskey also featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been “coerced, bribed or bullied” into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were “malevolent”. The GMC said: “The tribunal directed an -month interim suspension but all such restrictions are kept under regular review while a full investigation is carried out. “Doctors are unable to practice medicine in the UK while interim suspended. “These tribunals do not determine the facts of what happened, but undertake a risk assessment of whether temporary protection is needed.” The GMC investigated former Aontuacute councillor Dr McCloskey following a complaint made by Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP. She said: “I requested the General Medical Council to consider two social media videos posted by a Derry GP. It is essential that medical professionals provide patients and the general public with the best possible advice with regard to vaccinations. There is overwhelming evidence that vaccinations provide protection against the worst effects of Covid.     “I am extremely concerned that anti-vaccination and Covid denying propaganda is discouraging some of our population from being vaccinated. That is extremely damaging to the health of our population. “Derry continues to have a very high rate of Covid infection and the North of Ireland as a whole continues to suffer from a comparatively low vaccination rate. The medical profession obviously has a key role in tackling these issues.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Thursday, rd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Thursday, rd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Mickey attended St Columbs College, as did many from the south Derry area in those days.Like his siblings, he had a keen interest in all things GAA but his playing career was cut short following a serious motorcycle accident at the age of  years leaving him in a coma for six weeks. On his recovery, he worked as a shop man in Ballinascreen and later in Dunloy so was well known to many in those areas. Mickey and his we Nan later ran the shop in Moydamlaght, Moneyneana.After a number of years living in Magherafelt, to facilitate work in Enkalon in Antrim, Mickey ed to his beloved we Nans roots in Tamnaherin where they continued to raise their family. At his funeral, Fr McDermott noted that the gospel message of modesty was very apt with how much pride and love he had for his family.He was the loving father of Marie, Brian, Martin and Carmel, father-in-law of Fiona and Bronagh, the much loved grandfather of Lorcan, Darragh, Conor, Kian and Shea, son of the late Thomas and Mary and dear brother of Patsy, Margaretand the late Tommy and John.Mickeys other love of GAA continued throughout his long le and he travelled the country to watch Ballinascreen, Slaughtmanus and his beloved Doire, often accompanied by family and friends. On hearing of his passing, a friend said Mickey was a wonderful character. A true Gael. He never forgot his Ballinascreen roots. We will all miss him.Like all Derry Gaels, his best memory was the countys  All-Ireland triumph.Slaughtmanus paid tribute to him saying Mickey was a letime member and stalwart supporter of the Slaughtmanus GAC club, he was very knowledgeable about all things Gaelic football. He would always stop to talk to any fellow Gael about weekly results and news from teams and clubs around the countyMickey is my wes uncle and I can vividly remember our first conversation, a Sunday evening call to check the days results, performances and talking points. It didnt take long to realise he had a photographic memory. No detail was ever missed.“What Mickey didnt know was not worth knowing. a great and interesting conversationalist,” commented local GAA writer Bernie Mullan to me.In his later years Mickey worked in the car parks in Derry City, a role that allowed him to chat to many people, often leading to a few queues at the exit.When Derry released a yearbook in the mid-eighties Mickey penned an article on his memory of attending the final in Dublin, entitled: ...and they even came from Tobermore.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Thursday, rd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has notied MLAs of her intention to approve the long-awaited major new development. The news has been welcomed by Foyle SDLP MLA, Sinead McLaughlin who said: “I am delighted that we are now making progress at Fort George. googletag.cmd.push “I have been engaged in extensive discussions to enable planning approval to be given for new developments at the site. “These discussions have involved the council, government departments, Catalyst and others.  “The Fort George location is one of the most important in Derry, with a commanding and beautul view of the River Foyle. It has long been intended to be one of the transformative development sites in the city, but has been held back by a series of dficulties over the last two decades. “We are now on the journey to realising important regeneration schemes on the site. “As well as the construction of a second Catalyst business innovation centre, there is to be a major health facility at Fort George. Additional private sector proposals will be considered for other parts of the site. These developments will be supported by new road infrastructure. I hope and expect we will see signicant job creation flow from the projects.” Ms McLaughlin concluded: “Getting approval across the line has been very challenging, and I would like to thank Minister Mallon, other parts of government and the council for working together and with myself to resolve dficulties.”     In a letter to MLAs, seen by the Derry News, Ms Mallon said: “I have considered the report and advice from my officials and I have decided that reserved matters consent should be approved for the proposed development. It is my intention to announce that a Notice of Opinion to approve will be prepared and issued in the near future.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Thursday, rd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre has fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, councillors hope the complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the

completely destroyed anything in sight with crow bars and sledge hammers.Police believe the attack was carried out by professionals who are more than likely from outside the area, probably Belfast,

first he knew about the decision to remove his daily home help cam when the woman who has been attending him for the past number of years informed him two weeks ago she would not be back.He said he now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free travel for the elderly scheme during a meeting with Strangford MP Iris Robinson.Down councillor Peter Craig and Strangford MLA Kieran McCarthy have been at the forefront of the free travel for pensioners campaign.Describing the ferry crossing as a ldquovital service, Mr Campbell said he ldquofirmly believed free fares should be offered to senior citizens, in keeping with the Department for Regional Developmentrsquos policy to target concessions at users of public transport.The travel scheme will only be available to passengers over  years-old who are travelling by foot and will not be

steps towards healing damaged relations with local people.BT Cellnet representatives last week dismantled a mast at the Castlewellan Road in the town in an effort to appease the action group, Residents Against Masts , which was established to fight against the structure.The pressure group was formed last Monday night, just hours before the mast was erected against the wishes of local people who believe that it may put the health of children at risk.Following repeated calls by residents, BT Cellnet officials removed the -metre lamp post just two days later.The removal of the equipment has been hailed as a breakthrough by members of the RAM who have vowed to continue to fight against similar proposals in the town.A BT Cellnet spokesman this week confirmed that the mast had been taken down as a ldquogesture, but added that this was a ldquotemporary move.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Work to provide a new storm drain at a housing estate on the outskirts of Castlewellan is due to to

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery. Patients are at the centre of everything we do, and it is always lovely when patient families choose to get in touch.ldquoWe are humbled she decided to support the of wonderful work of Air Ambulance NI through her equestrian competition and campaign.ldquoAs a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep the medical team in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland. Without this type of support, the team simply couldnrsquot fly. The past year has been especially challenging for fundraising and wersquove seen a dramatic downturn in our income.She added: ldquoI want to take this opportunity to personally thank Joanne and her good friend, Rosie, who is helping with the campaign, for their unwavering commitment to their fundraising and I would encourage everyone to support their lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign in any way they can.If you would like to support Joannersquos Horse Powered Take Off competition please visit https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off  ORyou would like to support the Horse Powered Take Off campaign, please contact horsepoweredtakeoff@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Actors.jpg","title":"Local actors Shine in short movie filmed around East Down  ","story":"LOCAL actors have been lighting up the big screen in a short film that has recently scooped a notable cinematic award.lsquoShinersquo wrapped up filming last November after cast and crew spent months shooting in a host of local areas such as Bright and Kilmore, and now it has been crowned the lsquoBest Online Short Filmrsquo at the Dublin Underground Film Cinema Festival.The movie has also been listed as a semi-finalist at this monthrsquos Cannes World Film Festival, whereits success is to continue, will make it through to next yearrsquos final.The dramatic tale tells the story of Nick, a young man who lacks confidence in expressing his dreams to his traditional family, and who is tasked with balancing his work le with helping his father on their family farm.Part-time director, writer and actor Declan Curran from Attical, drafted in favours from family members and friends to help bring his debut production to le.The film was an unfunded, therefore it was created with a very limited number of cast and crew.Declandescribed filming in his unclersquos ldquohundreds of years-old cottage in Bright as an ldquoouter body experience, but it was just one of the many things included in the -minute long flick which was close to his heart.ldquoI couldnrsquot be more grateful to my family and friends for their commitment, time and effort of the course of making this film, he said.ldquoI would never have been able to make this dream of mine a reality without them, therersquos loads of personal touches included in the film.The upcoming talent had the help of Bright natives Jimmy and John McIlmailwho star in roles as lsquoFather Hughesrsquo and lsquoJohnnyrsquo.Speaking about Jimmyrsquos role as the priest, Declan says despite his great uncle being completely new to the acting world, ldquothere was no better man for the job.ldquoI actually had Jimmy in mind when I wrote the character of Father Hughes, so it just made sense to me that he was the one to portray him, he said.ldquoThe priest appears in a bus with myself [Nick] during the film, and I actually was wearing my late granddads cap in that scene while my mother Dolores made the priest collar Jimmy was wearing, so it was very family orientated.ldquoDue to Covid- we faced a dficult year in filming, so we had to try find ways around things for shooting. For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

We are saying that he didn’t raise them with us.”Sir Jeffrey said the church leaders’ statement showed that there was “no known diplomatic attempt” to alter anything about the event.He added: “The rejection of this event by the Irish head of state signals to unionists that the presidential office does not respect Northern Ireland as an entity and has little or no interest in a shared future with unionism.“Such a stance demonstrates how far the office under Michael D Higgins has drted from the shared future principles it once espoused. This disrespect for the existence of Northern Ireland indicates that Michael D Higgins’ office is really a united Ireland champion rather than a leader of reconciliation.”The DUP leader continued: “This saga has been a sad reflection on many years of outreach by unionists like me and others. I have travelled theand breadth of the island showing respect and explaining unionism.“I have stood in gardens of remembrance with my head bowed to show respect for people who were opponents of the Union. But I recognised that to take those steps was important to heal ision.“Rather than reciprocate on this occasion, Michael D Higgins has not only devalued and undermined such steps, but he has set back north-south relations to the detriment of the office which he holds.”Last week Mr Higgins said his decision to decline the invitation to the service had come after six months of consideration.He said: “That’s the beginning, so it isn’t a sudden decision, the decision is the outcome of a consideration.”He also challenged the DUP criticism of his decision.“It’s a bit much, to be frank with you. I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events,” he said.“There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now.”More from the News Letter: Click here: Devout Christian and ex-DUP councillor Alan Graham says he was “haunted” Rihanna’s ‘We Found Love’ as he recalls shoot  years on Click here: DUP minister - We must urgently let more immigrants come to work in Ulster’s food industry Click here: ‘British scum’: BBC Nolan caller from Belfast explodes at former top Tory over Universal Credit Click here: Both praise and scorn as DUP minister Michelle McIlveen caught in ‘gender neutral tampons for schools’ quandary Click here: DUP minister launches scheme for ‘pupils who menstruate’ – avoiding any mention of females Click here: Top Orangeman: Michael D Higgins is an irrelevant foreign head-of-state Click here: Investigation of dissident republican-linked charity still unfinished three years onA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We install energy-efficient boilers, which will help you save money on your energy bills whilst achieving our goal to reduce carbon emissions in the UK.\"Check your eligibility and start the simple process by clicking hereWho is First Choice Energy Limited First Choice Energy Limited is based in Dafen Industrial Park, Llanelli.It is passionate about creating a more sustainable world by improving energy systems for homeowners in Wales and is extremely proud to be certied ECO installers helping residents live in more energy-efficient homes - while making our environment more sustainable and eco-friendly.Director Aaron Davies took on the business from his father, who has been in the trade for nearly  years and is still very much hands-on with the team.First Choice Energy Limited is a registered on the Gas Safe Registered Engineers list, it is endorsed by Trustmark Government Endorsed Quality and is Blue Flame approved.What benefits are considered Eligibility for a free boiler grant will depend on several factors. Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is now a major threat to our recovery and the Government needs to step up its response to a new level of both speed and boldness.ldquoWhile many of these challenges are global in nature, the solutions we need are local.He added: ldquoGovernment is right to keep up the pressure on companies to adapt and not rely on immigration long term, but temporary visas are the only way to alleviate the disruption of shortages in critical skilled parts of the economy in weeks and months instead of years.ldquoGetting skills programmes right immediately is key to ensuring that these measures are only needed temporarily.ldquoOn energy, itrsquos imperative the Government provides a facility to enable well-capitalised suppliers to absorb new customers, and energy intensive companies, which underpin critical UK supply chains, are well supported throughout the winter.ldquoEstablishing a crisis management task force to move quickly ndash with both business and Government around the table ndash will ensure Government is far more informed about the nature and scale of the challenges can formulate responses fast and is able to get the support of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to take action required.

She was loving mother of daughter Julie mother-in-law of Colin , and devoted nanny of Lily, , and Isla, seven. Tandragee-born Sally and Bessbrook man Billy lived at Knockview Drive, Tandragee and were married for  years.The funeral service was on Monday at Tandragee Presbyterian Church where more than  mourners gathered in the church and adjoining church hall to pay a final lasting tribute to Sally. The service was conducted by the minister the Rev Mark McMaw, assisted by the Rev Stephen Kennedy, minister of Buckna Presbyterian church, Broughshane, and nephew of Billy.Danny Kennedy, brother-in-law of Sally, paid a fulsome tribute to a woman, who, he said, was respected and loved in Tandragee and in the wider community.He said: “This tribute was, in large measure, composed by Billy himself and I do want to convey the deep emotions expressed in it. Sally and Billy were married  years and Billy has described her as ‘a highly principled woman’ with very sterling qualities and positive attitude to le.“Sally was the youngest daughter of three to Daniel and Elizabeth Berry, of Scarva Road, Tandragee. Her sisters Jean , Tandragee and Betty , Loughgall and their families featured strongly all through her le, to the very end. “Sally’s father sadly died at the age of  when Sally was just . After leaving school, she worked at Sinton’s mill before working at Tayto where she was a much-valued member of staff for  years, forming close friendships with colleagues that endured long after her retirement.“Sally and Billy met on the local dance scene in around . They both enjoyed dancing to the Irish showbands and Billy was attracted to Sally’s natural good looks, radiant smile, and always well-dressed appearance. They had good and happy times together tripping the light fantastic!“They got engaged in October , and were married on July , , in Ballymore parish church, Tandragee. Sally, from the Church of Ireland Billy a Presbyterian. It was a mixed marriage! Sally became a Presbyterian and was a communicant in the Tandragee congregation.“For a short time, they lived with Sally’s widowed mother at Scarva Road, before moving to Cornmarket Street where they resided until moving to the newly built development at Knockview Drive in . By then, they had a young daughter, Julie, who was just six months when they moved to Knockview. “The Kennedy’s of Knockview were a close family of three, with Julie very attached to her mum especially. Sally and Julie were soul mates, and the bond became closer when Julie, after her marriage to Colin Beattie, had two daughters Lily and Isla. Sally loved her grand-daughters they were her pride and joy and, in recent times, when they visited the care home to see their nanny after Sally’s stroke, her joyful reaction was obvious. The girls would sing and converse lovingly with their nanny.“Sally was intensely proud of her home it was her castle and she enjoyed making it a special place for her family. She was very supportive of Billy in his career as a journalist with the News Letter, working long hours as news editor in Belfast during years of the Troubles. Sally, as a loyal Tandragee lady also encouraged Billy in his role with the loyal orders in the Bessbrook area.“Even though she had little interest in sport, Sally was also supportive of Billy’s considerable football interests with Linfield Football Club, as a director for  years. But she could read Billy like a book and when Linfield lost, she would quickly ask when he arrived home occasionally looking disconsolate from Windsor Park - ’Well, did the Blues get bate today ’ “Sally had a dry wit and enjoyed a laugh. She also was very supportive of Billy’s frequent travels to the United States for several decades for research for  books he wrote on the Scots-Irish Ulster-Scots migration and settlements. Sally, indeed, was in America with Billy on the day of the   attacks in New York and Washington in . They were in Knoxville in East Tennessee with an Ulster-Scots group.“Sally enjoyed good food, best holidays and she liked to dress in fine clothes. Over their time together, many happy holidays were spent in Portrush, Bournemouth, Scotland, Spain, Italy , United States and Canada. The  Canada holiday was particularly enjoyable as they travelled over the Rocky Mountains by train from Calgary and Toronto to Vancouver. It was the holiday of a letime!. “Sally, like Billy, also loved American country music and enjoyed going to concerts in Belfast to hear the leading American singing stars. She was also a fan of Daniel O’Donnell, and, of course a big Elvis Presley fan.“Sally’s stroke on April , , was a harsh, le-changing blow to not only herself, but to Julie and Billy also. She lost her speech and was immobilised down the right side. Her time spent in hospital and in Rosemount care home in Portadown lasted two and a half years, but the medical and nursing staff there provided top quality care which complimented the love and devotion of her family. “She became an integral part of Rosemount, and the family is indebted to everyone there for their   work with a special lady, who was a model patient in challenging circumstances.”Danny added: “Most importantly, Sally was a woman of simple dedicated Christian faith who every night got down on her knees to pray to God, her Saviour and friend. Her values were of the highest standard. Sally will live on in our hearts and her memory will be cherished by all who knew and loved her as a devoted we, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, sister and aunt, and friend to all those who came to know her. In Billy’s words - ‘Sally was a class act, loved and respected by everyone in her own family and wider community. “Sally loved her family her family loved her. We thank God for her le and His goodness to her. We believe that Sally, as a person of faith, the scripture verse from nd Corinthians, printed at the bottom of her death insertion is appropriate - “absent from the body, present with the Lord”.”Danny expressed thanks to the Rev Mark McMaw and the Rev Stephen Kennedy for conducting the service and the organist. Ryan Harris. Thanks were also offered to care home staff at Rosemount home for caring so well for Sally over the duration of her stay.

bidders, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough is set to re-release the tender for the management of Portadown town market.By The NewsroomFriday, th September , : amUpdated Friday, th September , : am  \"       \"  Following discussions of the matter at a meeting of Council’s economic development and regeneration committee on Tuesday, September  a Council spokesperson told the local democracyreporting service the tender will be advertised the week ending Friday, October .“The tender will be advertised until Friday, October  and Council would ideally like to have an operator in place by January , , subject to statutory approvals,” said a Council spokesperson.“Once the tender has been advertised, interested parties will be able to apply through theeTenders NI portal.”During the committeemeeting, members were provided with an update on the regeneration of Portadown town centre and the role a high quality local market will play in this.They were advised that following Council’s decision to bring its service level agreementwith the market’s former operator, Portadown , to an end, five expressions of interest were receivedfrom parties interested in operating and managing a market in the town.Following a public consultation a tender was advertised on Friday, May  and closed on Friday, June , no tenders were receivedas part of the procurement process.Since then, Council has been in ongoing consultation with traders in Portadown to reassure them of Council’s plans to locate the market in a section of the Magowan West car park.It is understood Council is keen to see the market operate two times a week with optional daytime or evening operational times.Commenting on the report, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath askedCouncil had consulted with the former market’s traders.Council’s head of regeneration, Nicola Wilson said Council has had a “busy summer” talking to traders and businesses through its consultation hub but had not been involved in direct consultation with the previous market’s traders.“In relation to the consultation with the existing market traders, we have not done that as we did not think it was an appropriate thing to do,” said Ms Wilson.“They are looking for a covered market space and that is not something we are going to be able to provide for them.“We have spoken to a lot of the town’s traders and a lot of the traders along Woodhouse Street as well to clary what we really want.“We will soon be in a position to go out with a tender that is more precise and detailed, I think that was probably one of the stumbling blocks in our first attempt to get a market provider in.“We are looking for an appropriate organisation to come in and provide the market service and that agent will be the one that will be liaisingwith the markets traders to try to develop what they need within the offering they have.”Read this - Club rallies round after child’s bike stolenEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Any decisions made then will not be introduced until a week later, making October  a signicant date. In a statement released tonight the Executive said they would “seek to finalise [the plan] at our meeting on  October. “On the areas of: numbers at domestic settings the ban on large house parties and raves the need to be seated to consume food drink and the need to be seated at indoor music events we will review the relevant data at October, not introducing relaxations in these areas before October. “Over the next few days we will undertake further work on what mitigations and measures would bring us to a position where we can make relaxations in the area of social distancing. With the case numbers still high, and the economic pressure on those businesses impacted by the remaining restrictions still being felt acutely, particularly across the arts, culture and hospitality sectors, we want to work to enable them to reopen to their maximum capacity as safely as possible and to remain open. “To facilitate this we are going to have further focused discussions with sector representatives on how we can work together to achieve this in line with the autumn winter planning needs. The sectors have some ideas we want to explore in more detail. We will meet again on Monday to discuss this issue further. “On international travel, we have decided to remove the requirement for Pre-Departure Testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries. This will come into force at am on  October.” The Executive statement continued: “Earlier this week we visited a hospital, and whilst there we listened to the medical and healthcare workers. We heard their worries and concerns and their pleas for us to take action now to avoid adding to the pressure they are already under, which we anticipate increasing signicantly over the winter period. “As we enter this period, which is traditionally a tough time for our health sector, we ask you to please, get your first and second vaccines,you are eligible for a booster please avail of that when it is offered to you. Every single person taking the vaccine makes a dference. “Continue to wear your face coverings, to wash your hands, and when meeting people indoors ensure the space is well ventilated. “Help us to help our medical and healthcare staff to get through this winter by keeping yourselves safe.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caabbcdbbcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfeacaaebbbdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632489256307.jpg--covid_19___fri_24th_september_figures.jpg?163248925600","title":"covid  fri th september figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows eight further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

These changes will bring all Western Trust Hospital sites back in line with the regional Department of Health visiting guidance for the first time since the beginning of the fourth COVID surge in mid-July. Commenting on the new guidance, Western Trust Executive director of Nursing, Primary Care and Older Peoples Services, Dr Bob Brown, said: “As a Trust we recognise the importance of visiting patients in Hospitals and that it can be a great support, particularly for older people. “We want to be able to facilitate safe, secure visiting in as controlled and risk managed a way as possible and for that reason, looking at the transmission rates and evaluating risk assessments from across all of our Hospitals, from Monday, September  we will implement consistent visiting arrangements in all Trust facilities for one visitor per patient for one hour, once a day. “Some exceptions will be made in special circumstances, for example, given the clinical vulnerability of the patient group, particularly in the haematology setting, visiting in the North West Cancer Centre will continue to be restricted to assessment on an inidual basis involving the patient, family and team.” It has also been announced that these conditions will also apply to both COVID and ICU wards, where in the interests of patient safety visitation will be by inidual negotiation with Ward Managers on a case by case basis. More frequent visiting in exceptional circumstances, such as at the end of le will continue to be permitted, as will visiting for birthing partners to maternity services, each in an inidually risk assessed way. Paediatric wardsin Altnagelvin and South West Acute Hospital will continue to permit a parent to be at the child’s bedside, again ensuring this is risk assessed and in a COVID- secure way. This position will be reviewed again on Friday, October . The Western Trust is also encouraging members of the public to complete lateral flow tests before visiting any of its premises to provide confidence to both visitors and staff that visitors are not COVID positive and to help the Trust maintain COVID safe environments for all. These visiting arrangements will remain under constant review and may change in response to any further increase in infection rates impacting on any particular department, eg an inability to retain a COVID- secure environment of care. The safety of patients and staff will always be to the forefront of any decision made, the Trust says. Patients have been reminded only to attend AE alone, where possible. Children and vulnerable adults can be accompanied by one person.\",\"keywords\":\"Western Trust,visiting,restrictions,--\",\"articleSection\":\"News\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE Western Trust has announced that all of its Hospital sites are to move to the same lsquo--rsquo visiting restrictions, , with effect from Monday, September  .\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.
