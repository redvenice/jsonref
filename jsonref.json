In addition, we immediately took down the advert for the space pending sorting this issue out.\u0027It is unfortunate that, in this instance, this homeowner (who is not a JustPark customer) took matters into their own hands and impounded the driver\u0027s car and demanded a fee for its removal.\u0027We have rigorous checks in place to ensure that driveways that are advertised on our platform are done so in a proper way.\u0027The advert for this space was submitted to us back in 2019 and our fraud team did highlight this space as potentially fraudulent, but I can see that a number of weeks later the advert was set live - this was human error on our part and we can only apologise for this.\u0027Like all companies, we are sometimes the target of fraudulent activity and our fraud teams work hard to detect this and to protect our customers.\u0027We have thousands of adverts submitted to us every month and the vast majority are genuine - we pride ourselves on being able to help homeowners generate an additional revenue stream, as well as being able to help drivers find affordable and pre-bookable parking spaces in locations that are convenient for them.\u0027We park over 1.5 million cars every month and generate over £50 million each year in parking transactions for our space owners, and have overwhelmingly positive reviews from customers.\u0027On the very few occasions that there are complications between drivers and space owners due to a misunderstanding, we can usually resolve these quickly and amicably.\u0027In situations like this, we would always ensure that the homeowner is compensated appropriately.\u0027However, this incident escalated disproportionately because the homeowner, who isn\u0027t a JustPark customer, reacted inappropriately and completely disproportionately and took the law into their own hands, impounding a vehicle which was parked by a driver who believed that they had a genuine booking.\u0027The booking in question was of course fully refunded last Wednesday.

With Felixstowe nearing capacity, we have faced some challenges in returning containers to the port.\u0027The port authorities in Felixstowe, which handles 40 per cent of container deliveries to the UK, said a shortage of drivers means it is taking about ten days before cargo can be taken inland to be unloaded, up from the usual four-and-a-half days.Last week, the port imposed restrictions on receiving empty containers from Maersk and Evergreen but it has now restarted accepting them.It said: \u0027The pre-Christmas peak, combined with haulage shortages, congested inland terminals, poor vessel schedule reliability and the pandemic, has resulted in a build-up of containers at the port. \u0027Empty container levels remain high as import containers are returned and we are asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible.\u0027Alex Veitch, deputy director of public policy at Logistics UK, which represents the freight industry, warned that the congested ports could become a \u0027serious issue for UK supply chains\u0027.He said: \u0027The current issues being experienced at Felixstowe port are partly due to the HGV driver shortage. Our members are reporting that some are struggling to source drivers to pick up and deliver containers, which is causing a backlog in the port which prevents new loads from being landed. There are also issues with finding drivers to work in the port itself.\u0027Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group, said: \u0027What has exacerbated the situation are some of the well-known supply chain issues inland here in the UK – the HGV driver shortage is the most prominent of them.\u0027The UK is said to be short of some 100,000 HGV drivers.

They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents.

The carbon centre of gravity is calculated by taking an average of each country’s latitude and longitude, weighted by their annual emissions. The most polluting countries exert the strongest gravitational pull on the centre of emissions. At the beginning of the 20th century the industrial powerhouses of the US, UK and north-western Europe were responsible for the majority of emissions. By the end of the second world war, the global centre of emissions was located a mere 25 miles off the east coast of the US. Since then, rising industrialisation in Asia – led by China – has dragged the centre of emissions more than 7,000 miles eastwards. It is now located on the Tibetan plateau in western China. This representation should not be interpreted as suggesting that the population of China produces a disproportionate amount of CO2. On a per-capita basis, 36 countries had higher carbon emissions in 2020. But the centre of gravity does highlight the importance of getting large emitters such as the US and China to commit to stronger climate policies at the Cop26 summit. New modelling from the International Energy Agency suggests carbon emissions have peaked in the world’s wealthiest economies –⁠ including in Europe and the US –⁠ but are likely to rise in less developed countries over the next decade. This is under a stated policies scenario, which considers current and announced climate policies from governments around the world. To limit global warming to 2C, governments would need to drastically raise their ambition, shutting fossil fuel power plants while ramping up investment in renewable energy and electric cars.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Dr Glynn  gave a briefing to senior officials on Wednesday  warning that the Covid-19 pandemic had taken an unexpected turn for the worse. Photograph: Julien BehalWith decisions due imminently on the final reopening of society planned for next week, the trends around Covid-19 are decidedly mixed.Not surprisingly there is widespread fatigue with the pandemic, alloyed with some disappointment at the “bang for buck” mass vaccination has delivered in Ireland.Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, we currently have one of the highest incidences of the disease in Europe. While many of our neighbours are speaking of the pandemic in the past tense, the talk here is of a possible fifth wave.As usual there is no certainty about what will happen, and no unanimity among experts, but we are starting from a high base in terms of case numbers. We find ourselves in a worse position than countries that locked down less – or hardly at all – and who have fewer people vaccinated. Currently, the incidence of Covid-19 in Ireland is about three times what it is in France, Germany and Denmark. We are four times the level in Sweden, five times the level in Italy and almost six times higher than Spain.The gap has been there for months now, but has never been adequately explained. It is clear Ireland has suffered from its proximity to the UK, where case numbers have been higher than here for much of the pandemic.Officials point to Ireland having bigger and more multi-generational households where transmission can occur. Critics of official policy maintain we are not doing enough to reinforce the impact of vaccination by, for example, demanding higher ventilation standards or masks on young children. Critical care bedsSo Ireland goes into the winter tackling Covid-19 from a higher floor than almost anywhere in Europe but the UK. Meanwhile, our ceiling is lower because we have fewer hospital and critical care beds even after improvements made during the pandemic.This limited room for manoeuvre informs the caution behind much of our pandemic policy. There is a genuine fear of the health system being overwhelmed if things change quickly which, with Covid-19, they often do.The proportion of positive tests has been edging up since last September, and now stands at 8 per cent. Counties such as Kerry and Waterford, which were less affected earlier, are now at the top of the list. It seems the rise in cases is due less to specific outbreaks and more to wider trends relating to the reopening of society, and it is happening across the State.Many other countries are experiencing surges in cases, most of them mild and short-lived. This is true here too now that so many are vaccinated, yet even that small minority of cases leading to serious illness is increasing pressure on the health service.The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital has been climbing steadily for months, and is currently almost 10 times higher than at the start of July. ICU numbers are five times higher.Most of these people are unvaccinated, but thanks to breakthrough infections, there are almost as many vaccinated Covid-19 patients in ICU now as there were Covid-19 patients in ICU a year ago. As many people have died with the virus in the past month as did in the run-up month to Christmas last year.Surges and localised outbreaks can be expected at this stage of the pandemic. We have been warned to expect them as society opens up. The key questions are: Are they expected? What is driving them? Can they be contained? NervousnessUncertainty about these answers is driving the latest bout of nervousness among officials. Daily case numbers have exceeded 2,000 three times in the past week but we don’t yet know why.Up to now modelling has done a reasonable job of predicting trends, albeit at the optimistic end of the scenarios laid out.Officials forecast a rise in cases among young people, and a subsequent settling down, and this happened. Now cases are increasing among older people, of which a greater proportion will fall ill.Logic would suggest we look at the performance of the vaccines, which experts say are still about 80 per cent effective after six months. In June, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan was hailing the “near-elimination” of Covid among the vaccinated, but for all the heavy lifting the vaccines are doing, the cracks in the defences they provide are evident now. The clamour for boosters, starting in over-60s and healthcare workers, will only get louder in the weeks ahead.At this point it appears that plans for further reopening may have to be tweaked, rather than having them ripped up or new restrictions imposed, so that this wave can be kept to the proportions of a bad flu winter.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2022 main points what s in it for you","story":" journalists look at the political and economic impact of the multi-billion-euro Budget 2022.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersA top US Democrat with powers to sign off on trade deals said the UK backtracking on the Northern Ireland Brexit deal “doesn’t send the right signal” when it attempts to strike other deals. Congressman Richard Neal told The  he was surprised by the “much harder line” taken by the UK government in recent days in the dispute with the EU over the Brexit trading agreement for Northern Ireland “when goodwill ought to be able to break the logjam.”Responding to the call from Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost for a new protocol, Mr Neal criticised the UK for attempting to “reinvent the circumstances around the negotiation” of the Northern Ireland protocol and then calling for a renegotiation of the deal they signed up to. “The idea that they could blame the European Union for its interpretation when the truth is they have already acceded to the agreement that has been implemented,” he said.On Tuesday, Mr Frost called for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one and a reversal of the UK’s previous agreement where the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court, holds an oversight role on EU-UK disputes over the implementation of the protocol.“If the argument is that you can just unilaterally abridge an agreement, it doesn’t strike me as being a very solid remedy for future trade agreements or trade partnerships,” said Mr Neal.The Massachusetts Democrat will have ultimate sign-off over any future US-UK trade deal in his capacity as chair of the powerful House of Representatives ways and means committee.His remarks came after Tánaiste Leo Varadkar warned other governments doing trade deals with the UK that it has shown that it is a nation that “doesn’t necessarily keep its word and doesn’t honour agreements that it makes.” Mr Neal said that Northern Ireland “should not be held hostage to the whims of an agreement that many predicted would be one of the outcomes of Brexit.”The UK as “a sovereign nation” had made “their own determination” of the protocol by agreeing to it, “but they also made it sound as though it was going to be easy,” he said.Praising the Northern Ireland peace agreement, he said the goodwill that pact had “where everybody had to give up something, ought to be the template for the measurement of success.” Mr Neal repeated his view that the US could not agree a trade deal with the UK if the 1998 Belfast Agreement was jeopardised by the fallout from Brexit. This view was backed by US president Joe Biden and the speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, he said.Asked about comments by Boris Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings that the UK had always intended to tear up the Northern Ireland Brexit deal signed in 2019, Mr Neal said he rejected outright the idea that international agreements should be broken. “If the argument is actually being made in some quarters that you don’t have to worry about reaching agreements because you can arbitrarily break them afterwards, that doesn’t send the right signal,” he said. He said if this was his position as the lead negotiator on the recent trade agreement reached between the US, Mexico and Canada then nobody would agree trade deals with the US.“If we had gone into that negotiation by saying: ‘Well don’t worry about it we will just not adhere to the parts of it we don’t like after we have agreed to it,’ I don’t think there would be many people in the world that would be interested in having a trade agreement with us,” he said.

Photograph: Aris OikonomouAFP via Getty ImagesThe nod from the member states came late. Hours before the release of the proposals to adjust the Northern Ireland protocol, it was still unclear whether all capitals would give their approval.The move to eliminate 80 per cent of checks on goods from Britain destined for Northern Irish supermarket shelves, to slash customs formalities, and exceptionally to allow unfrozen meat products into the single market due to reasons of national sensitivity, arguably opens up a gap in protecting European Union agriculture and, officials admit, creates an opportunity for cross-border smuggling.To offer it, the EU’s Brexit point man Maros Sefcovic had to overcome the reservations of member states including France, long wary of the risk of plant and animal diseases entering the single market via Britain and threatening its agriculture industry, and already in a stand-off with London over fishing licences that makes it reluctant to be seen to reward British brinkmanship with concessions.\u0026nbspSefcovic also had to overcome resistance within the European Commission, among officials who work on food, animal and plant safety and on fair competition under the French internal market commissioner Thierry Breton.“The lawyers have been at it for months,” a diplomat recalled, describing “blood on the floor” in the confrontations over the matter. “The commission is pushing at the very edge of what is accepted by member states.”The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has trashed its relationships on the continent. Even Irish officials, who once enjoyed special insight into Whitehall due to long personal and cultural links, are estranged from the true motivations of London.Cummings tweetA throwaway line explaining how Britain could agree arrangements for Northern Ireland only to ditch them later in former Downing Street svengali Dominic Cummings’s latest Twitter screed crystalised the impression London has given its allies: “good faith blah . . . cheating foreigners is a core part of the job”.To win the support of member states, the EU’s package was presented not as a cave-in to this deeply unpopular regime, but as an adaptation to a very different group, one seen as much more sympathetic and pragmatic: the people of Northern Ireland themselves.The four papers began life in Sefcovic’s engagements with Northern Irish stakeholders, particularly the industry collective the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group, and in a trip to Northern Ireland in September to listen face-to-face.What the commission heard was appeals for practical adjustments to ease the implementation on the ground, for stability and predictability. To work within the protocol – a hard-fought solution to the conundrum posed by a Brexit that a majority in Northern Ireland did not ask for – not to jettison it.Industry figures have indicated that they recognise in the EU proposals a response to their demands, and that indeed the measures go further than what they could have hoped for.Unfortunately for them however, these fixes are not the sole gift of the EU to give. They require London: British authorities must implement aspects of the protocol that were agreed but never enacted, such as sharing real-time customs data, labelling NI-only goods with stickers, and building permanent border infrastructure, as part of the package.Equally, proposals by the EU to formalise direct links with Northern Irish authorities and stakeholders and involve them in oversight of the package through parliamentary and committee structures require the British government to acquiesce.ECJ issueIn a speech on the eve of the EU’s announcement, Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost repeated a demand he knows that Brussels cannot concede: that the role of the European Court of Justice be removed in overseeing the EU regulations that apply in the North.This was seen in Brussels as a piece of political theatre, arranged last minute in a bid to blunt the impact of the EU’s proposals.British sources insist that the ECJ goes to the heart of the problems with the protocol. Yet it did not feature as a problem when the text was negotiated and agreed, and only emerged as a demand this July, long after the deal came into force.The adoption of the principle of opposition to the ECJ by a handful of the unionist politicians closest to the Brexiteer camp – described as “latter-day converts” to the issue by one person close to the talks – is viewed as a risky strategy.“History shows Boris Johnson can change his mind very quickly, and defend his new position as if he had never believed anything else,” one official mused.“When will the DUP realise they shouldn’t tie themselves to Brexiteers?

That concession gave the EU continuing power over a part of the United Kingdom, destabilised the fine balance in Ulster that had been achieved by the Good Friday Agreement, and gave the EU a formidable negotiating lever for the rest of the process. It eventually led to the fall of her administration, and the Protocol that implemented it has posed an insuperable problem ever since.That is why Lord Frost described the Protocol as “the biggest source of mistrust between us” and the EU. It not only threatens business and the flow of goods, but also the hard-won peace in Northern Ireland and the fabric of our national unity.  This wholly unsatisfactory arrangement has resulted in 20 per cent of all customs checks in the whole of the European Union being undertaken in Northern Ireland. That is three times higher than at Europe’s busiest port, Rotterdam. The EU’s operation of the Protocol is unnecessarily bureaucratic, unbearably burdensome, and verging on vindictive. It is certainly not even-handed in the way that the Good Friday Agreement envisaged. David Trimble, who put his life on the line and won the Nobel Prize for the Agreement, has said that the tensions created by the Protocol represent a danger to the lives of people living in Northern Ireland.Sadly, the disruption caused by the Protocol is representative of the larger problem of the EU always having viewed Northern Ireland as a source of political leverage. That is the only thing that explains its pattern of behaviour, including the attempt to trigger Article 16 in a spiteful response to our vaccine success in January. That behaviour put exercise of the leverage afforded by the Protocol above any interest in the consequences for the people of Ireland, north or south.Now the EU has conceded the case on border checks, possibly because it realised that its position was untenable. When listening to the ill-informed commentary on the needs for border checks, people should remember that before the Protocol was even imagined, both the heads of Irish and British Customs authorities gave evidence to their respective parliaments that no visible checks were necessary at the Irish border to maintain single-market integrity – but that was before the politicians got involved.Nevertheless, in the final analysis Brexit was about a democratic decision to control our own affairs. So most British citizens would be surprised to hear that the Protocol gives the European Court of Justice continued power over Northern Ireland. This back-door concession of the UK’s sovereignty perhaps is the most egregious aspect of the Protocol, and correcting that is one of the central demands of the British Government.As I said to Theresa May back in 2017, this goes to the heart of the whole Brexit argument: it is a matter of sovereignty. While progress on trade can be welcomed, ultimately a palatable Brexit won\u0027t have been achieved until Northern Ireland is no longer subject to EU law. And what would it cost the EU to soften its position? As Britain’s negotiator made abundantly clear this week, the answer is “very little”. Lord Frost said: “We are not asking to change arrangements within the EU in any way. We are not seeking to generalise special rules for Northern Ireland to any other aspect of our relationship.”  Yet the EU has rejected this request, which tells you how constructive it is really being in this. It desperately wants to avoid a trade war – wisely under current circumstances – but still wants to penalise us for abandoning its project. Well, my advice to Lord Frost is: keep pressing on.We do not want to relive this history of the past five years and endure more rancour and resentment, we merely want an acceptable solution for Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. A strong democracy like Great Britain should be content with no less.More from NewsNorway bow and arrow attack: At least five people killed in KongsbergGPs ‘named and shamed’ if they fail to see patients face to faceWhite House set to force healthcare plans to cover gender reassignment proceduresSally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People printed by state-owned Chinese publishing houseCambridge University ‘Terf-spotting’ guide condemned as a ‘witch-finder’s charter’The Good Life becomes the high life as stars smoke cannabis in stage revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid lab leak theories must investigated says world head organisation","story":"All theories must be investigated in the hunt for the origins of Covid, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said in the first indication that engineered virus and lab leak theories will be officially scrutinised.In a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, and two colleagues wrote that lab hypotheses must be carefully examined with a focus on institutions in Wuhan. They added: A lab accident cannot be ruled out until there is sufficient evidence to do so and those results are openly shared. Unlike previous interventions by the WHO, they do not say that an animal spillover is the most likely scenario.It comes as the WHO announced a new Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago), which will examine the emergence of Covid in greater detail.On Wednesday, 26 scientists were nominated to join Sago. They included Dr Yungui Yang, the deputy director of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr John Watson, England\u0027s former deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Stuart Blacksell, a professor of tropical microbiology and biosecurity expert at the University of Oxford.There will be a two-week consultation period in which WHO members may challenge inidual appointments.While the team will continue to investigate the potential for an animal spillover through wildlife sold in markets around Wuhan and other natural scenarios, it will also look into the possibility of a lab accident.Earlier this year, an investigation by the WHO concluded that the Covid pandemic was likely to have had a natural origin, probably jumping from animals to humans. But the inquiry was criticised after it emerged that Chinese scientists had declined to discuss the lab leak scenario unless the final report dismissed any need for further investigation.Since the outbreak, China has also refused to grant access to lab records which would show whether natural or engineered viruses were being held at Wuhan. It has also failed to allow access to blood samples of the earliest Covid infections.It has since come to light that Wuhan scientists were collaborating with US teams on research to make coronaviruses more infectious to humans.The editorial said it was clear that politics had hampered efforts by scientists to get to the bottom of what had caused the global outbreak.The previous WHO investigation team included Peter Dazsak, a British zoologist who worked closely with Wuhan and US researchers on tracking down deadly viruses and engineering them to be more infectious. He has been left out of the list of nominees for the new team.Writing in Science, Dr Tedros and colleagues said it was crucial to learn the true origins of Covid to avoid another deadly Disease X. The editorial said: Laboratory hypotheses must be examined carefully, with a focus on labs in the location where the first reports of human infections emerged in Wuhan.All hypotheses must continue to be examined and, as WHO has said from the outset, a fully open and transparent scientific process is essential.The editorial authors, who also include Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO Covid technical lead, and Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, called for lab protocols around the world to be monitored and strengthened.Detailed investigations of the earliest known and suspected cases in China prior to December 2019 are still urgently needed, including analyses of stored blood samples from 2019 in Wuhan and surrounding areas and retrospective searches of hospital and mortality data for earlier cases, they said.Globally, at least 4.8 million people have died from Covid-19. They and their families are owed answers as to where and how the virus originated. It\u0027s in everyone\u0027s interest to better prepare for the next Disease X.On Wednesday, China said it would analyse up to 200,000 samples held in blood banks for traces of Covid, a long-standing demand of the WHO and the international community.More from NewsNorway bow and arrow attack: At least five people killed in KongsbergGPs ‘named and shamed’ if they fail to see patients face to faceWhite House set to force healthcare plans to cover gender reassignment proceduresSally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People printed by state-owned Chinese publishing houseCambridge University ‘Terf-spotting’ guide condemned as a ‘witch-finder’s charter’The Good Life becomes the high life as stars smoke cannabis in stage revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu concedes border checks optimistic brexiteers last vindicated","story":"Pro-EU commentators are baffled as to why Lord Frost gave his keynote speech on the Northern Ireland Protocol from the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. It may not have occurred to them that Portugal is our longest-standing ally (since the signing of the Treaty of Windsor in 1386), and that there was a world before the hegemonic behemoth that is the European Union.These are the same commentators and former politicians, some now well paid advisors to big business, who cheered on Theresa May\u0027s disastrous decision to sequence the Article 50 talks after the 2016 referendum entirely in the EU\u0027s favour – placing negotiating the Northern Ireland Protocol and a generous deal on citizens rights and a financial settlement before trade talks. These folk also gave us the unloved, incredible and unworkable Chequers deal, which would have locked the United Kingdom into a permanent customs union and single market for goods, and into a subservient role as a client state, rule taker and milch cow for Brussels, lacking democratic accountability or the means to escape such purgatory.  There is not the slightest hint of a mea culpa, however. The very fact that today the EU will resile from its hitherto absolutist and inflexible approach to the Protocol by agreeing to practically barrier-free access from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (\u0027tweaks is the technical term), easing customs checks, standing down diktats on sausages (bizarrely described as \u0027identity products\u0027) and medicine supplies, and agreeing to proper and regular consultations via the Joint Consultative Working Group, gives the lie to the idea that the negotiated Protocol was inviolate and set in stone. Perhaps the EU has also properly comprehended the realpolitik around the Good Friday Agreement, something absent in their pronouncements since 2016. In fact, in September 2018, during the interminable Tory Brexit civil war, the European Research Group published proposals, based on EU precedents and examples such as the Norway-Sweden border, for so called Max Fac technical solutions to avoid a hard border in Ireland, allowing remote physical checks away from the border, the use of trusted trader schemes, data sharing and computer-based customs procedures, and an All Ireland Biosecurity Zone, which would protect the customs and regulatory integrity of the European Union\u0027s single market while safeguarding the political and constitutional position of Northern Ireland as a constituent part of the United Kingdom. Of course, they were ignored by the May government.I might add that the rejection of this sensible policy was the reason David Davis quit the Cabinet as Brexit Secretary in July 2018, but, as in so many ways, he has been largely vindicated. Even the born-again Eurosceptic and putative French presidential candidate Michel Barnier was honest enough to concede the merits of such an approach.Meanwhile, we were told that we had a weak hand and the EU had all the cards and early capitulation was imperative.That hasn\u0027t really turned out to be the case, has it?Brussels now faces the real prospect that the Johnson Government will invoke Article 16, effectively ripping up the Northern Ireland Protocol. It has the legal bona fides to do so, as a number of legal scholars concede after perusing the treaty text. Even with concessions on customs and border issues, the continued supreme jurisdiction of a foreign legal entity, the European Court of Justice, over the 1.8 million British citizens in the province, which renders Northern Ireland a de facto EU colony, remains anathema and a firm red line to many Brexit supporters. It is unresolved and must surely be addressed, perhaps by the creation of a judicial body separate to the British Government and the EU, which could adjudicate between the two parties in the operation of the revised and improved Protocol.Hard-liners in France and Germany may threaten to terminate unilaterally the UK\u0027s trade deal – the Trade and Cooperation Agreement  – in response, but that leads down a dark road of animosity and mistrust which ends in a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and withdrawal of UK defence, intelligence and security assistance, such as the UK military help given to France in policing its former colonies in Africa. We\u0027re not yet at crisis point. The EU has shown that it can be flexible and imaginative, and Lord Frost clearly wants a deal. Recent history shows it\u0027s the most likely outcome, even if it means (for once) playing hardball with our \u0027friends and partners\u0027 across the Channel.Stewart Jackson is founder and director at UK Political Insight and was a Conservative MP and Chief of Staff to former Brexit Secretary David Davis MP 2017-18More from NewsNorway bow and arrow attack: At least five people killed in KongsbergGPs ‘named and shamed’ if they fail to see patients face to faceWhite House set to force healthcare plans to cover gender reassignment proceduresSally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People printed by state-owned Chinese publishing houseCambridge University ‘Terf-spotting’ guide condemned as a ‘witch-finder’s charter’The Good Life becomes the high life as stars smoke cannabis in stage revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"good life stars enjoy high life modern day stage revival","story":"It is a stage revival of The Good Life which perhaps should be renamed The High Life.The new production has updated the Seventies television series by having Tom and Barbara Good smoke cannabis.The stage version finds the eco-friendly couple, played by Rufus Hound and Sally Tatum, getting high at home before taking some marijuana-infused bread to a dinner party hosted by their neighbours, Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, played by Preeya Kalidas and Dominic Rowan.It is not something that the characters in the original show, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal, ever contemplated.In the play, Tom and Barbara turn to drinking pea pod wine to cope with the stress of their new life, and resolve to grow pot in the potting shed.Their “dealer” is a local pig farmer who turns up and hands them two ready made cannabis joints, which he nicknames Surbiton Specials.Kalidas said the stage show offered something new and would appeal to audiences too young to have seen the BBC sitcom.“We aren’t just doing impressions of the original characters. We are taking them on a new journey which hopefully will be enjoyable for the audience, whether or not they are already fans,” she told The Stage.She added that the character of Margo, memorably played on screen by Penelope Keith, “reminds me of some of my Indian aunties”.Hound said the play could teach modern Britain a valuable lesson about getting on with people regardless of ideological and political differences.“At the moment, we are more than aware of our differences. Every front page, every time we open our phones, we’re aware of how different we are from people,” he said.“And yet The Good Life, deep down and underpinning it all, is this idea that even though they’re different, there’s something about how similar they are that means they are never going to fall out.“They start from the point of view ‘Well, we’re neighbours, we can’t fall out’. Whereas, in 2021, the point of view is a bit more ‘You’re my enemy, so you stay over there’.”Hound suggested that there would be plenty of people out there who identified with Tom and Barbara’s desire to leave the rat race.“What is it about this nearly 50-year-old story that still resonates with people?” he told the BBC. The original show ran from 1975 to 1978.“Ultimately, it’s a man who gets to middle age and turns to his wife and says, ‘What is this all for? We’re doing work we don’t like to buy things we don’t need’.“And it just so happens that his wife feels exactly the same. And from there, they realise if they live their own lives and go for self-sustaining, maybe they can cast off the shackles of modern life and go their own way.”The TV sitcom was written by John Esmonds and Bob Larbey, who previously had a hit with Please Sir! The idea was inspired by Larbey turning 40 and joking about his midlife crisis.It was said to have started a craze for allotments. It also turned Kendal into a pin-up, and the actress summed up Barbara’s appeal as “nice, a bit naughty and 100 per cent wholesome”.The Good Life is at the Theatre Royal Bath until October 16, then tours nationwide.

It’s mystifying.“To build something completely the wrong way is a major cock-up. How can a national developer make such a major mistake?“If a builder makes a mistake, they have to bear the consequences of that. It’s gone through a long process and a number of iterations to get where it is today but obviously they now need to build it to the agreed plan.”Persimmon Homes has previously come under fire for other blunders, including a leaky sewage system that allegedly left a family in Derby covered in rashes.In another alleged mistake, a homeowner in Cardiff forced the company to knock down and rebuild his walls that apparently contained damaged bricks.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said that some alterations had already been made to the homes in Colchester. He added: “We have made some limited alterations to the position of some windows during the early stages of construction, in line with our planning consent.”More from NewsNorway bow and arrow attack: At least five people killed in KongsbergGPs ‘named and shamed’ if they fail to see patients face to faceWhite House set to force healthcare plans to cover gender reassignment proceduresSally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People printed by state-owned Chinese publishing houseCambridge University ‘Terf-spotting’ guide condemned as a ‘witch-finder’s charter’The Good Life becomes the high life as stars smoke cannabis in stage revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day tightrope walker practises wells cathedral festival","story":"Tightrope walker Christopher Bullzini from Evercreech crosses Wells Cathedral this week as part of the Festival of the Moon, the Moon is by Bristol artist Luke Jerram.

Sorry, sorry! I swear I won’t do it again. Just seeing it on the page gives me a visceral feeling of fingernails-down-a-blackboard horror. Not funny. Sorry again.I only did it to make a point, namely that grammar really matters. Those who care about it, do so deeply. Those who don’t used to be in the ascendancy – but no longer, thanks to a court case in Australia where a costly civil trial pivots on an apostrophe. How fabulous is that? I couldn’t be more cock-a-hoop if Lynne Truss herself came to tea – even if she eats, shoots and leaves.Interestingly, the nub of the issue is an apostrophe causing mayhem in absentia. To whit an estate agent posted remarks on Facebook about his former employer. These included a reference to the expensive properties on the firm’s books, followed by the qualifier “but can’t pay his employees superannuation. Shame on you Stuart!!! The estate agent claims he meant to write “pay his employee’s superannuation”. This cut no ice with his former employer, who felt the implication was that he had failed to pay “his employees’ superannuation” and wants to sue for defamation. The judge agreed there was a case to answer, saying: “To fail to pay one employee’s superannuation entitlement might be seen as unfortunate to fail to pay some or all of them looks deliberate.”Frankly, I’d sentence him to life for all those exclamation marks, but the salutary plight of the Apostrophe One is the ultimate endorsement of traditional education with its nitpicking emphasis on correct practice. After years of sloppy indifference towards punctuation et al, a new primary grammar curriculum was introduced in England in 2014 – whereupon parents like me raised a cheer. Catholic guilt gets a bad rap, but to their credit, back in my day the Irish nuns (holy) waterboarded us with concepts including subjunctives, the gerund and never using a preposition to end a sentence with.Once the fundamentals are mastered the truth is that there’s great delight to be had in language. Its structural rules are no more onerous and every bit as sensible as those laid down for cricket, Monopoly or flying a plane. Quite simply, syntax is the scaffolding that enables others to understand what we mean and thus makes language accessible and universal.As for those stereotypes about “grammar Nazis”, frankly it ill behoves the wilfully illiterate to equate entirely justified attention to detail with authoritarianism. Last time I checked, Fowler’s Modern English Usage bore vanishingly little resemblance to Mein Kampf, not least because the latter was riddled with grammatical errors.Language, of course, evolves. Why, I have learned to joyfully embrace the split infinitive. I can even find it in my heart to forgive (or at least not judge) those untroubled by – which is to say blissfully unaware of – the who-whom pitfall and I-me conundrum. But having said that, the Oxford comma makes me cross and as for the egregious apostrophisation of plurals – if it sets off what Truss called “a Pavlovian ‘kill’ response” for you, then rest assured, I share your linguistic anguish.All journalists relish a clever play on words but apostrophe apostasy is nothing but a crime against clarity.More from NewsNorway bow and arrow attack: At least five people killed in KongsbergGPs ‘named and shamed’ if they fail to see patients face to faceWhite House set to force healthcare plans to cover gender reassignment proceduresSally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People printed by state-owned Chinese publishing houseCambridge University ‘Terf-spotting’ guide condemned as a ‘witch-finder’s charter’The Good Life becomes the high life as stars smoke cannabis in stage revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings says no10 always","story":":root Dominic Cummings says No always planned to ditch Brexit deal after electionBoris Johnsons former aide said Downing Street always intended to tear up the agreement the PM told voters was \"great\" and \"oven ready\"Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson never understood his own Brexit deal Image: Getty ImagesByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | comments Downing Street always planned to ditch parts of the Brexit deal it didnapost like after it whacked Corbyn at the polls, Dominic Cummings has claimed. The isive former No aide said Boris Johnson always intended to tear up the agreement - which he hailed as a great deal during the  election.But Mr Cummings said the PM never had a scoobydoo about what the agreement actually meant, as he continued his war of words against his old boss. Irish Deputy PM Leo Varadkar said the comments were alarming and warned world leaders against making trade agreements with the UK. He told RTE: Surely the message must go out to all countries around the world that this is a British government that doesnapost necessarily keep its word and doesnapost necessarily honour the agreements it makes.  And you shouldnapost make any agreements with them until such time as youaposre confident that they keep their promises, and honour things, for example, like the protocol.The UKaposs Brexit chief Lord Frost has piled pressure on Brussels to rewrite a key part of the deal governing trade in Northern Ireland. But he confessed on Tuesday that the Government only signed the pact so they could tell voters they had got Brexit done. Mr Johnson repeatedly boasted that the agreement negotiated with Brussels was a great deal that was oven ready to be signed.In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings said: What Iaposve said does NOT mean aposthe PM was lying in General Election apos, he never had a scoobydoo what the deal he signed meant.He never understood what leaving Customs Union meant until November . Mr Cummings, who was a key player in the Vote Leave campaign, has become a ferocious critic of his former ally Boris Johnson, who he often derides as a shopping trolley careering from side to side. He said the Government wriggled through with best option we could and intended to get the trolley [Boris Johnson] to ditch bits we didnapost like after whacking [Jeremy] Corbyn. Mr Cummings was a key player in Downing Street until November , and remains a isive figure for his combative stance in No and his famous lockdown trip to county Durham. The EU is expected to set out plans later today to cut checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain after increased red tape led to disruption for businesses. But European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has made it clear that the EU would not accept Lord Frostaposs demand for powers of oversight to be stripped from European judges. The Northern Ireland protocol was designed to protect the peace process by preventing a land border on the island of Ireland. Instead, regulatory and customs checks and processes were shted to the Irish Sea. It has caused new economic barriers on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, creating disruption for businesses and tension among unionists.

The Shadow Business Secretary branded Insulate Britain activists’ tactics “counterproductive” and warned they risked “alienating” the public.Speaking at a Green Alliance think-tank event, the former Labour leader told the Mirror: “I think it’s deeply counterproductive, some of what has been happening, I really do.“Part of the task of peaceful protest is to win people to your cause, not alienate them.”He compared Insulate Britain’s methods of bringing traffic to a halt on the London orbital motorway with the  school strikes waged by Swedish teen eco-warrior Greta Thunberg and her supporters.“One of the points I would make is the comparison with the pupil climate strikers,” he said.  “Some people will have said, ‘Should they really be off school Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter“But it pricked people’s consciences, it drew attention to the issue, it super-powered government action, but it didn’t alienate huge swathes of people - and that is my real worry, honestly, about what Insulate Britain have been doing.”He was speaking hours after motorists and Insulate Britain activists clashed in Essex.A mother berated protesters for stopping her from driving her -year-old son to school. Lorry drivers blasted their horns and a female protester was nearly run over by a frustrated motorist as the environmental campaign group blocked roads for a th time.  Multiple confrontations occurred at around .am, with demonstrators dragged off the roads by drivers near a busy industrial estate in Thurrock. Insulate Britain, an offshoot of environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, has now staged protests  times in recent weeks. The group has blocked parts of major roads around London, including the M and M, to draw attention to climate change. Mr Miliband said the “whole agenda of retrofit and insulation is a very important agenda” - and committed to Labour to borrowing money to make homes more environmentally-friendly. “We have said we will borrow to invest,” he said. Speaking before next month’s COP climate change summit in Glasgow, he warned the world would be watching Boris Johnson for leadership as top politicians descended on Scotland.Calling on the Tory chief to have a “laser focus” on the talks, Mr Miliband added: “The role of a Prime Minister is really crucial in this - it is on him. “It’s his reputation on the line, as well as the fate of all of us.” Mr Miliband also urged the Government to issue banks with a deadline for setting out how they will help limit global temperature rises to . degree celsius. Government should ask all financial institutions not just to report on climate risks, as they plan to, but to bring forward by  credible transition plans that are consistent with a . degree pathway,” said Mr Miliband.  “This would make a profound dference in the flow of finance out of fossil fuels and into green energy. We should ask all our FTSE  companies to do the same and have their own climate transition plans, consistent with . degrees, by  - and furthermore, we should be asking in Glasgow that all major economies follow suit. Mr Miliband also left the door open to slapping a windfall tax on energy firms, saying: “All options should be looked at during this period.” It came as the PM’s COP spokeswoman Allegra Stratton told the Institute for Government think-tank the success of the climate summit would be judged on getting to the end and feeling that . has been kept alive.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ed MilibandBoris JohnsonClimate changePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

NEDs are supposed to be independent officials who “oversee performance and delivery” in a government department.Ben Goldsmith was made a NED at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsby then Environment Secretary Michael Gove in .But he failed to give up the job, which pays £, for  days work a year, when his brother Zac was made a DEFRA minister by Boris Johnson the following year. “Under the Tories the doors of government departments have been wide open to dodgy lobbyists, Tory donors and friends of Ministers,” Ms Rayner said.  “The role of Non-Executive Director is being routinely abused by Conservative Ministers to hand out jobs to their mates, who are £, a day of taxpayersapos money to apparently scrutinise their chums who gave them the cushy gig in the first place. Zac was allowed to keep the job despite being voted out as MP for Richmond Park in the  election, after the PM made him a Lord. DEFRA does not believe there is a conflict of interest in Ben Goldsmith’s role.People are not barred from NED roles because of political activity, as long as it is declared.There’s no suggestion either Ben or Lord Goldsmith have broken any rules.The Mirror revealed this week that Mr Johnson was soaking up the sun at a luxury Marbella hideaway owned by Lord Goldsmith, as the UK remained in the grip of a cost of living crisis.  Ms Rayner added: After the scandal of his last luxury getaway and the dodgy funding for his Downing Street flat refurbishment, the Prime Minister should simply tell us who is paying for his holiday. “The rules are clear - but Boris Johnson has a habit of breaking them. “If he is getting another freebie then the public have a right to know who is paying, how much theyaposre paying and what theyaposre getting in .

The abandoned three-bedroom semi-detached home in Stafford has become overgrown with shrubbery and weeds after its owner died  years ago and now it will go on the market for less than £,.After a wave of complaints from neighbours about its crumbling condition, the property in Tixall Road, Stafford, will go under the hammer with a reserved price of £,, reported StokeonTrentLive.The property auction is set to take place in November and a condition of the sale will be that the buyer brings it back into use within a set time-frame. Council officials tried to track down a next of kin after the previous owner died but without success.  Stafford Borough Council applied to the secretary of state for Communities and Local Government for consent to make a Compulsory Purchase Order– which allows the local authority to take control of the house. Cabinet member for Communities and Health, Councillor Jeremy Pert, said getting the CPO was the last resort. He said: In the first instance we look to work with owners of empty or run-down properties to help bring them back in to use - and last year we assisted more than  homeowners to successfully do this. Empty properties are a wasted resource which can quickly become a blight to the community – but we have a range of measures where we can help the owner, or their next of kin, make their property habitable. Obtaining a CPO is always a last resort as it can be a y legal process which is why we would much rather work with people to remedy the situation in other ways.” He added: This has been an exceptional case in which we have gone to extraordinary s to ensure we can get this property back on the market and I am sure with the right investment and works it will make someone a nice home in the future.

The UK’s biggest Covid swab testing study shows cases increasing among under-s but falling in those aged  to . A top public health expert has warned that a “reservoir of Covid infection” in teenagers is now seeping through to older age groups. Imperial College London’s REACT- study tested more than , people in England between  and  September. Scientists calculated an R value of slightly above  for the general population, but an R value of . among under s.  The Government has lted almost all restrictions despite official testing data showing there are now . daily Covid- deaths per million people in the UK. This is more than twice the rate in France and Germany and five times that of the Netherlands. Yesterday the UK reported , more confirmed cases and  more deaths within  days of a positive test. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the REACT study, said: “Our latest data show that infections are high and rising in school-aged children. “Households with children also had a higher prevalence of infection, suggesting that children may be passing on the virus to those that they live with. “These trends reinforce how important it is for children aged  and above to get vaccinated and help curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education.” After one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world other countries have now caught up with the UK. France, which has vaccinated more children than Britain, is among those countries with a higher proportion of the population as a whole vaccinated.  Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: “These data demonstrate that while our vaccination programme continues to make a huge dference, the pandemic is not over. “While cases remain high, the vaccination programme is ensuring that this does not translate to a similarly high number of hospitalisations and deaths. “We are urging everyone who is eligible to come forward for vaccination. It is the best way to reduce transmission and protect ourselves and those we love.” Official data shows just % of  to  year olds had been vaccinated in England as of Monday. Take up among  and  year olds was %. In Israel more than half of those over  years old and some younger children have had a single dose of Covid- vaccine. By October some .% of children aged  to , and % of  to -year-olds had received a first shot. Even at the point the UK approved Covid jabs for children last month Denmark and Spain had already vaccinated most of their  to  year olds. France too had moved quickly with % of those aged  to  then already single jabbed, and % fully vaccinated. The UK has only approved a single dose for  to  year olds following extremely rare side effects reported after second doses. The Government has lted all other restrictions in England that could limit the spread of the disease in schools and is relying solely on the success of the vaccines roll-out.  Prof Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University, said: “It is a huge experiment. “We have a reservoir of infection in this country and it’s largely in teenagers, and I think that’s the bit of the jigsaw, which is really causing big problems at the moment because of course those cases are seeping through now to older age groups.” It comes as one regional health leader said they are considering ing schools to remote learning. Southend has transmission rates among teenagers almost three times that seen in the general population. Director of public health Krishna Ramkhelawon said: “People aren’t testing, and parents aren’t checking them. “We’re not sure how they’re going to run remote learning alongside usual school running. If % of the class is self-isolating or unwell, they should move to remote learning. “We don’t want any days lost within education, butwe need to move to remote learning then we should.” Vaccine passports in countries such as France and Italy are also thought to have helped to boost rates. The UK’s infection rate is more in line with that of the east of the continent, where slower vaccination rollouts and easing of social distancing have caused cases to surge.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “The phenomenal progress of our vaccination programme has built a strong wall of defence across the country, allowing us to live safely with this virus.“These findings shows how important it is for young people to get the jab to protect them from COVID-, and for those eligible to get their booster vaccine to prolong their existing protection.” Comment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was rushed to hospital, where doctors found he escaped with minor injuriesAlan Bale was trapped beneath a pile of bricks when the wall collapsed Image: BPM MediaByStephanie BallooChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA bike helmet saved the le of a man after he became trapped under a pile of bricks when a ft wall collapsed on him. Alan Bale, , said he screamed for help after the incident near his home in Pershore Road, Stirchley, Birmingham, at around am on Monday.His leg was pinned beneath his bicycle until passers-by, paramedics and paramedics arrived to help him, Birmingham Live reports.He was rushed to hospital, where doctors found he escaped with minor injuries. Alan said he owes his le to his sturdy helmet, but after the incident, he became worried about what could have happenedthe wall had come down on his two children.  The incident took place in an access corridor for four terrace homes through which all residents have to pass to leave, Alan said. The wall was previously part of a home but was left standing when developers demolished the property, he added. The man, who has a four-year-old daughter and a -year-old son, said: The thing that freaked me out is my child had been out the gate the evening before. I was lying there thinking itaposs just dumb luck that my child - who is like a stick - wasnapost under that wall last night. He would have been crushed by the wall. He said other residents could have been seriously injured or even killed by the collapsed wall.  Alan said he has been haunted by the thought that his son had been pushing his bike just where the wall collapsed the night before the incident. He explained: I was shaken by what happened. The wall had a large metal gate on it and was very high, ft tall, two layers. They demolished the house to create access and they left that wall standing. The wall has been gently leaning over for some years and on Monday morning it was leaning on the gate. I opened the gate which is a heavy metal gate, and it needed a bit of a shove because it was holding up the entire wall.  I opened the gate and walked through and within about five seconds the wall came down on me, trapping me between the wall of the house and the wall that was falling on my head. I stepped back against the house wall as far as I could and turned on my side. I had a bike helmet on, which probably saved my le as well. The wall collapsed on me and knocked me down and my bike was trapped under a pile of bricks and my leg was trapped under the bike. I was twisted up pretty badly and had bricks all over me. I pulled the bricks away from my hands and body as quickly as I could and called for help. Two passers-by came and pulled more bricks off me until I could breathe properly. Fire and ambulance turned up and continued so I could get my legs out.  My we ran out into the street, she was really freaking out. I couldnapost walk very well as my hip had been twisted, I managed to limp away. In the hospital, doctors found he had injuries to his arms as well as bruises. Alan said he is now struggling to move around and has pain, but is otherwise okay. Alanaposs we, Stephanie, praised quick-thinking neighbours who rushed over to help after hearing his calls to be rescued from beneath the bricks.  She explained: As soon as it happened I couldnapost get to him. I heard a noise it sounded like something blew over in the garden, then I heard Alan screaming. I went to the back gate and all I could see was a wall of brick. I had no idea how bad it was. Neighbours immediately jumped in to help and people weaposd been engaging with through our community projects, we knew they were able to help with our daughter. We had a lot of people pull together for us which weaposre really grateful for. West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics were called to the street just before am. A spokeswoman for the service said: “We were called at .am to reports of a wall that had collapsed on Pershore Road, Birmingham. One ambulance, a paramedic officer a Hazardous Area Response Team paramedic and a BASICS doctor attended the scene. On arrival, we found one patient, a man, who was assessed at the scene and had sustained non-le threatening injuries.

Richard, , and Danielle, , who wanted to be known only by their first names, were told their son had to be delivered eight weeks early to save his le. They said their babyaposs heart rate was dropping after Danielle went to hospital with stomach pains. Medics discovered she had a suspected ruptured placenta and needed an emergency caesarean so baby Owen was just lb oz when he was born - the weight of a pineapple.Richard, from Wallasey, Wirral, told the Liverpool Echo : Danielle had started having pains and we went straight to hospital.  They told her they thought it was a suspected ruptured placenta - which is what it turned out to be - and Owenaposs heart rate was right down. She had emergency surgery to get him out. It was terrying, completely heartbreaking. We were toldwe had left it another hour, he wouldnapost have made it because his heart rate was so low. Tiny Owen was just lb oz - the weight of a pineapple - when he was born on October , but his dad said he is going from strength to strength.  Richard, who is also dad to Cain, , Lewis,  and stepdad to Jack, seven, said: When he was born we heard him cry like a kitten and then he was given straight to Danielle and then I held him for a bit.

We canapost thank all the staff at Arrowe Park enough, they saved his le and made everything so much easier for us. Owen has not yet met his brothers and sisters due to Covid restrictions on the hospital wards at Arrowe Park. Richard said: They are made up and they canapost wait to meet him. We expect he will have to stay in until his due date in December, but he has been doing so well, he might be able to come home a little sooner.

The owner of the parking app that led the rogue parker to the driveway has slammed the move as “morally bankrupt”, but police have said itaposs legal. Barry Newton and his girlfriend Zoe Hameston were baffled when they found the blue Peugeot parked at their home in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, without their permission last week.The pair took to Facebook in an attempt to track the stranger down and demand they move their car, but upon having no luck with this they took matters into their own hands.The pair blocked the car in with their other vehicles and upon the owner’s , told them it would cost £ to release it. But when police were called to the scene they determined that aposno crimes were committedapos by either party and so could only offer guidance on the matter.  The caraposs owner, apparently the victim of a parking app scam, is believed to have paid the £ cash fee to be able to leave with their vehicle. JustPark, a parking app called on which areas are listed as parking spaces for hire, confirmed that the rogue parker had used their app but had fallen victim to a apospotentially fraudulent listingapos. The company apologised to them for having to fork out the money. Zoeaposs original Facebook post read: Could the owner of this car, registration [redacted], please remove your vehicle from my private driveway within the next  mins or I will remove [it] myself, thanks. But after  minutes, Zoe and Barry closed their gates and blocked the end of the drive before demanding a fee - in cash - from the driver.  The driveway had reportedly been listed as a parking space for hire without the home owneraposs knowledge and the Peugeot owner parked there believing they had a legitimate booking. Despite claiming to have aposrigorous checksapos in place to ensure adverts are legitimate, the parking app admits that this listing was highlighted as potentially fraudulent when it was submitted back in  but was set live by aposhuman errorapos. Hours later the unaware owner of the car finally ed to find their vehicle aposimpoundedapos - and Zoe claimed she was refusing to release the vehicle until they coughed up. Zoe said in Facebook comments: [Itaposs] still f***ing here and apparently they have [been] on an app called [JustPark] and have [paid] to park on my sheltered drive with CCTV and lighting. When I have had a look [at] the description [for the advert] they would [have] known something wasnapost right. They are now sat at [the] bottom of my street as I [canapost] find [the] key to [the] gates and [canapost] release [the] car [until] they now pay me.  When a commenter asked for an update, Barry replied with a photo of multiple notes being handed over to him - prompting people to react in shock. Officers attended the address in Haltwhistle and offered advice to both parties but in the end it is believed the owner of the aposimpoundedapos car was forced to pay up the £ cash fee to be able to leave with their vehicle. As the incident unfolded live on public Facebook posts, stunned locals commented aposwhat a cheek to park on someoneaposs driveapos urging the residents to aposclamp itapos and aposcharge themapos to release the car. But others warned that the owner of the car was the aposinnocent victimapos of a scam themselves and insisted that demanding a fee was aposmorally bankruptapos. However Barry defended his actions and said he had no proof the car owner was telling the truth as aposshe couldnapost prove itapos when he asked for a receipt. He said at the end of the day, itaposs private property. Police have advised that the payment of a £ fee is a civil matter not for police to rule on and have said, should the car owner wish to, they can pursue this to seethey can retrieve the money back through the civil courts. A spokesperson for JustPark said the homeowners had been apologised to while company employees had made attempts to contact both the driver, and the person who had advertised the parking space. “In addition, we immediately took down the advert for the space pending sorting this issue out,” they said. It is unfortunate that, in this instance, this homeownertook matters into their own hands and impounded the driver’s car and demanded a fee for its removal. The advert for this space was submitted to us back in  and our fraud team did highlight this space as potentially fraudulent, but I can see that a number of weeks later the advert was set live - this was human error on our part and we can only apologise for this. We have thousands of adverts submitted to us every month and the vast majority are genuine - we pride ourselves on being able to help homeowners generate an additional revenue stream, as well as being able to help drivers find affordable and pre-bookable parking spaces in locations that are convenient for them. On the very few occasions that there are complications between drivers and space owners due to a misunderstanding, we can usually resolve these quickly and amicably. However, this incident escalated disproportionately because the homeowner, who isnapost a JustPark customer, reacted inappropriately and completely disproportionately and took the law into their own hands, impounding a vehicle which was parked by a driver who believed that they had a genuine booking. The booking in question was of course fully refunded last Wednesday. We have additional rigorous checks in place before any space owners can withdraw their earnings, which further prevents any fraudulent activity on our .” The booking in question was fully refunded last week, the spokesperson said, while JustPark had been in touch with the driver to determine what steps would next be taken to resolve the situation.

More than , people in the UK own a Ring doorbell, meaning the ruling yesterday could pave the way for similar cases across the country. The neighbours were peaceful until recently when the doctor claims Mr Woodard became aggressive when she told him she was unhappy about the doorbell, Oxford County Court heard. Judge Melissa Clarke told the court yesterday Mr Woodard had breached the Data Protection Act  and UK GDPR laws. The ruling now entitles Dr Fairhurst to compensation and Mr Woodard is banned from recording her with his surveillance cameras. Any images or audio files of Dr Fairhurst stored on the devices are now considered her personal data. The judge also found that Mr Woodard - considered a data controller by the Information Commissioner - failed to store Dr Fairhurstaposs data in a fair or transparent way. He had also sought to actively mislead Dr Fairhurst about the way the cameras worked and what data they captured. Judge Clarke said Mr Woodard had collected the doctoraposs personal data by recording her beyond the boundaries of his property.  Another camera was installed in Mr Woodardaposs driveway - which he claimed was a dummy. The judge disagreed and said this camera captured images and audio on Dr Fairhurstaposs property including her gate, garden and car parking spaces. She also said crime prevention was achievable with something less than the Ring device. Judge Clarke added the cameraaposs audio range canapost be considered reasonable for crime prevention. Mr Woodard told the Mail after the remote hearing he was extremely disappointed and shocked by the ruling. He told the Mail: I purchased a ring doorbell and ring motion activated camera in , in good faith to protect my property and vehicles. To now be told these are harassment devices feels like a joke and I myself feel like I am being harassed. Many of my neighbours have cameras and smart doorbells.  He added the ruling contradicts police advice. Forces up and down the country are known to appeal for the public to hand over smart doorbell, CCTV and dashcam footage to help bolster evidence to assist arrests for thieves, dangerous drivers, and violent criminals. Mr Woodard also said he worries that tens of thousands of homeowners with similar devices may now be targeted in the same way. Amazon-owned Ring has now asked its customers to make visitors aware they are being recorded in response to the landmark ruling. A spokesperson for the Calornia-based company told The Mail: We strongly encourage our customers to respect their neighboursapos privacy and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device. Weaposve put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security, and user control remain front and centre - including customisable Privacy Zones to block out aposoff-limitapos areas, Motion Zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off. Damages payable to Dr Fairhurt are expected to be revealed during a November court date, but she could be awarded £,. The ruling means that anyone with the same Ring doorbell who is accused of filming people outside their property could be subject of a similar lawsuit over breaching the privacy of their neighbours.

Learn moreLike so many of us Brits, I can safely say that I have a slight issue with maths anxiety.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it started in primary school I had somewhat of an amicable relationship with maths, I wasn’t exactly top of the class but I grasped the concept and did quite well on the whole.I would have chosen writing a short story over times tables any day but I wouldnapost exactly say that I hated the subject. The same can be said when I first started at secondary school, but as time progressed, my eventual dislike for the subject gradually started to creep in over the years.It wasn’t until the dreaded GCSE years of school that I developed a real anxiety towards the subject.Flashbacks of a strict teacher firing questions around the classroom springs to mind. So does the insistence for you to repeatedly answer despite succumbing to the pressure and failing in front of everyone. It’s enough to give you clammy hands at the mere thought of it. Hence why in the nine years since I walked out of that maths classroom for the final time, I’ve steered clear of using subject. We of course use maths in every day le on a basic level but I haven’t since spared a thought to more detailed fractions, nor algebra and certainly not Pythagorasapos Theorem.In fact, I dread the day thatI do have children and find myself in a position where I need to help them with their maths homework.Itaposs fair to say that I donapost have a great relationship with maths now, so in the lead up to finding out my maths age, I was pretty nervous, as silly as that sounds. The testA maths age is something that is calculated by Maths-Whizz, a tool that simply measures your childaposs mathematical knowledge via fun activities and non-pressurised assessments. And here I was, at age , giving it a go. You can take the test for yourself here. The test is broken down in to five neat sections and topic areas:Written Numbers Addition and Subtraction Multiplication and Division Fractions GeometryaposEasy peasyapos I thought...spoiler alert, I was wrong! I thought I was doing okay in the Written Numbers and Addition and Subtraction sections for a fleeting moment I even thought that I might even enjoy the test. I found the Multiplication and Division sections harder before the Fractions section almost knocked me for six - and not much more can be said about my experience with Geometry.Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by you can do that here. If you want to sign up for a month at a time or even a year, you can do that here but donapost forget to use the promo code aposMATHSapos.  The entire time I had a notebook in front of me to write down my working out, which posed as a slight embarrassment when a certain question hinted that aposyou may want to write down your working outapos, when my pen had barely left the paper for the duration. At the end of the test, even the paper in front of me was witnessing my frustration with not being able to answer certain questions, scrawling things like What IS an improper fraction     ” on top of my calculations. What I will say though, is that I really appreciated the format of the exercise, with colourful and engaging graphics filling the screen. I can see how these would delight children and certainly are a far cry for the exceedingly aposgreyapos basic s we used to use for schoolwork. At one point I even found myself bobbing along in unison with the colourful little alien character...was I aposenjoyingapos an actual maths test ! It seemed so.  My maths age In some ways, despite my deep-rooted anxiety with maths, I was half expecting a fairly decent score because of my enjoyment of the exercise. Although I found a few questions challenging and had to skip a few, it seems unfair to refer to it as being a test, it was more of an engaging exercise, thanks to the relaxed nature of it all. There was no going back however now, the scores were in and my maths age was revealed as being…. and  months.... Now, I like to think of myself as a somewhat ing member of society despite my maths anxiety but it does shock me that I’ve been wandering around as a -year-old equipped with the maths knowledge of an almost -year-old. Sure, not everyone has top notch maths skills and there is nothing wrong with that but this experience has truly inspired me to brush up on my mathematical ability because I worked too hard in school for all of that knowledge to just elude me. My biggest takeaway from the experience is that, shock horror, I did quite enjoy myself and I can honestly say, even from a brief introduction to Maths-Whizz, using a  like that when I was back at school wouldaposve been highly beneficial and maybe even stemmed some of the negative attitude I have towards the subject.

But how  do they make money  And what other deals have they signed  Here we take a look...Netflix deal Harry and Meghanaposs biggest deal so far appears to be with Netflix, which they will work with to create content that informs but also gives hope. It is unknown exactly how much the deal is worth but it has been reported it could be worth  million.Programmes in the works are a documentary about the Invictus Games that Harry founded and a childrenaposs series about a young girl called Pearl and her adventures, where Meghan will act as executive producer.Their productions will be exclusive to Netflix, which has over  million subscribers worldwide. Insiders previously revealed that content centred on social messages, racial justice, gender equity and the environment feature heavily in Harry and Meghanaposs shows.Meanwhile, last month, it was reported that Harry was spotted with a mic during his and Meghanaposs tour of New York.The black wire could be seen sticking out his trouser pocket and into his shirt and it has been suggested the couple may have been recording content for their Netflix deal. Spoty partnership Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Another big money deal signed by the Sussexes is with Spoty, which is said to be worth £million. It will see them produce podcasts that promote “erse and inspiring voices” under the coupleaposs brand Archewell Audio. Since signing the deal, only a short trailer and a Christmas special podcast have been released. It featured interviews with Sir Elton John and James Corden as well as a short clip of their son Archie wishing listeners a happy new year. Apple TV venture Earlier this year, Prince Harry teamed up with billionaire chat show queen Oprah Winfrey to produce a docu-series on mental health. The programme – Harry’s debut as an executive producer – was screened exclusively on Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+ and was called The Me You Canapost See.It is unknown how much Harry was paid but Apple is understood to have wanted to tie him into a long-term deal worth millions before he signed his exclusive agreement to produce for rival Netflix. Start-up investments Last year, Meghan also enlisted the help of Oprah to help sell a vegan brand of coffee she had invested in. The Duchess backed the firm Clevr Blends – a start-up that makes instant oat-milk lattes – as she reportedly “begins to build a portfolio of startup investments”. However, the value of the deal is unknown.The business plans to use the investment to scale its business, which currently sells four dferent kinds of instant lattes retailing for £ per packet. Customers buying a pack also get a milk frother and a travel mug. The brand also donates one per cent of its revenue to food poverty charities in the US. Authoring books  Both Harry and Meghan have entered the world of publishing with both either working or have worked on books. Meghan wrote a childrenaposs book called The Bench, which was inspired by a poem she wrote for Harry shortly after son Archie was born.It is unknownMeghan received an advance for the book, but a branding expert told MailOnline an advance could have been worth £,. Meanwhile, it was announced earlier this year that Harry would be releasing a wholly accurate and truthful memoir, which will be published next year.Announcing the new book, Harry said: Iaposm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man, I have become. Iaposve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned - I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. However, it has been revealed that proceeds from the book will be donated to charity. Harryaposs job In March, Harry revealed he was taking a job with a San Francisco-based start-up whose app uses a aposTinder-styleapos system so users to scroll through and aposmatchapos with counsellors and le coaches. Harry has become the Chief Impact Officer at BetterUp, which provides employee coaching and mental health assistance. In his new role, Harry will help promote mental fitness and expand BetterUpaposs roster of coaches and customers, among other duties, a company blog post said The companyaposs chief has kept his lips sealed on the sum paid for his celebrity hire.However, a US-based apps investor, told the Mirror the royalaposs star appeal to clients could bring handsome compensation of £, to £million a year at a minimum including salary and equity.Ethical investments  Now the coupleaposs latest venture is with a sustainable investment firm called Ethic. Yesterday, they revealed they have become impact partners and investors in the fintech asset manager, which has .billion under management. It is believed that the couple were introduced to the firm, which only invests in companies that they deem to have acceptable environmental and social goals, by friends. It is unknown how much they have invested or what they are being paid. A statement from the couple said: When we invest in each other we change the world… Be it through the investment of time , investment in community , or the investment of funds , our choices—of how and where we put our energy—define us as a global community. We believe it’s time for more people to have a seat at the table when decisions are made that impact everyone. We want to rethink the nature of investing to help solve the global issues we all face. Our impact partnership with Ethic is one of the ways we put our values in action.Meanwhile, in a joint interview with Harry, Meghan told DealBook : “From the world I come from, you don’t talk about investing, right ”“You don’t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy. “My husband has been saying for years, ‘Gosh, don’t you wish there was a place whereyour values were aligned like this, you could put your money to that same sort of thing apos” Comment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, six, collapsed with fatal injuries at a home after he was forced to spend marathon stints in front of the front door, Coventry Crown Court heard. It was also claimed little Arthur was made to sleep on the floor in the living room despite the fact there were empty beds upstairs. Prosecutors say it was part of a campaign of cruelty he was allegedly subjected to before being unlawfully killed. Arthuraposs father Thomas Hughes, , and his partner Emma Tustin, , deny murder and multiple counts of child cruelty. Tustin has admitted one child cruelty offence.  During the fourth day of the trial on Tuesday, prosecutor Jonas Hankin alleged the couple assaulted Arthur, isolated him from the family, forced him to stand up for prolonged periods of time, denied him food and drink as well as poisoned him with salt. Mr Hankin told the jury about the events leading up to Arthuraposs collapse on June  last year. On June , Arthur spent a total of  hours and  minutes in the hallway, the court heard. CCTV of Tustin eating a McDonaldaposs in the living room was shown to the court as Arthur ate lunch a few feet away in the hall.  At one point, Tustin allegedly sent Hughes an audio clip of him crying along with a text message reading: P***ed me off he has. Paused Corrie. Hughes allegedly replied: Kid is a selfish little c*** Iaposll dash my food off his head. Arthur then spent a further  hours and  minutes in the hallway on June , the court heard. The jury watched CCTV from the home of the couple eating ice cream cones as well as sitting in the hot tub.  Earlier that day, Tustin allegedly texted Hughes accusing Arthur of making my le hell and claiming she was slowly but surely cracking. By the afternoon, it appeared Hughes was trying to seduce Tustin to the bedroom by messaging her saying he was naked and waiting for you to take my soul. Mr Hankin then read a text message to the court from June  that was sent from Tustin to Hughes, which said: Still screaming. He said he hates me. Heaposs gonna spit his sandwich out on the floor when he has it. Loves his nan more than you.  Heaposs just said he donapost f***ing care now saying haha because I said Iaposm telling you. He said you wonapost believe me, you will believe him like before. Now screamed heaposs gonna tell his mom to kill me. Just on the phone to Affy. He said: aposGlad we arenapost going because I was going to be naughty all day for you. Mr Hankin told the court Tustin was the only possible perpetrator behind the alleged fatal assault on Arthur on June  because she was the only one at home looking after him. He argued Hughes shares culpability because he intentionally encouraged the killing.

Social media is seeing users increasingly talking about having caught a “Super Cold” as Covid- tests come back negative. Prof Neil Mabbott, expert at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This highlights the power of the lockdown, mask wearing, social distancing and sanitation measures introduced in response to the pandemic.“Not only was this very effective in reducing transmission of the coronavirus within the community, but at the same time it had the additional benefit of reducing the spread of colds and other common transmissible diseases.“As these measures are eased and people start mixing more indoors and travelling on public transport we can expect to see a signicant rise in colds and other respiratory diseases.”  Retail worker Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth, caught what she calls “the worst cold ever” at a festival.A normal cold for her would have “a runny nose, sneezing, a bit of a sore throat and feeling a bit rundown”.“Nothing like this,” she told the BBC. “I barely slept, I’d wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired,” she adds. Rebecca did lateral flow tests and got negative results, but has been ill for more than a week, and was left wondering “ it’s ever going to end”.  Prof Alex Richter, of Birmingham University, said: “It is impossible to tell the dference between a cold and Covid- clinically. “They present so similarly that only PCR testing can dferentiate between the two. Lateral flow testing can help with screening, butsomeone has symptoms then they should go for a PCR swab test.” “It is unlikely we are seeing the circulation of a aposSuper Coldapos,” Prof Mabbott added. “Rather our immune systems have had limited exposure to colds over the past  months, so our immunity to these diseases will have waned during this period and will be less effective against colds than would be expected normally.” Prof Alan McNally, is Professor of Microbial Evolutionary Genomics at the University of Birmingham and was Infectious Disease lead at the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. He said: “If you have any symptoms of respiratory infection you should stay at home to prevent transmission and get a test done for Covid- to rule in or out. Trying to self-diagnose is a sure fire way to send Covid- case rates soaring again.” Comment MORE ON EducationHospitalsHeart diseasePublic transportCoronavirusNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr John McCauley says spiralling cases in China, India and Croatia could indicate an earlier wave of infections in the UK this year. It comes amid a warning that immunity against bugs is so low after Covid lockdowns that the flu could kill , people. The UKaposs flu season usually begins in September and ends in March but the NHS usually starts to feel the pressure in January. However Dr McCauley - a prominent flu scientist based at Londonaposs Francis Crick Institute - says Brits should prepare for an earlier surge in cases due to a rise in infections overseas. He told MailOnline that Croatia, China and India had all experienced a rise in infections.It’s over the next few weeks that we will be able to tellwhat we are seeing now is sustained. If it is, we might expect an early flu season, he added. There is flu being picked up in some places, but whether it is spreading in some of theseis not known for certain. His warning comes as Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, fears Brits will face a deadly double act of Covid and flu this winter due to waning immunity. Dr Harries said the public should be worried about the flu each winter. Speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky she warned that those who catch both illnesses at the same time are twice as likely to die than patients with Covid alone. She said: On average over the past five years, around , people have died [per year] with flu-related conditions.  The important thing about this winter is that weaposre likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. The risks of both together still remain. The early evidence suggests youaposre twice as likely to die from the two together than just Covid alone. Last week Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy chief medical officer, warned that immunity against bugs is so low after lockdowns that the flu could kill , people. He said: “Not many people got flu last year because of Covid restrictions, so there isn’t as much natural immunity as usual. “We will see flu circulate this winter. It might be higher than usual and that makes it a signicant public health concern. Covid- will still be circulating and with more people mixing indoors, sadly some increases are possible. For the first time we will have Covid- and flu co-circulating. Urging people to get the Covid jab, he added: “We need to take this seriously and defend ourselves and the NHS by getting the annual flu jab and the Covid- booster when called. Both these viruses are serious. They can both spread easily, cause hospitalisation and they can both be fatal. “It is really important that people get their vaccines as soon as they can.” Comment MORE ON NHSFluNorovirusCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The community of just over  people on the west coast at Knoydart have been so successful with a bold fundraising campaign to purchase the distant drinking hole that it called time on its share offer a week early - by which point they had raised £, from  members! Have your say on this story in the comment section  Now, the locally formed The Old Forge Community Benefit Society, has announced it has been awarded £, through the Scottish Land Fundto support the purchase and redevelopment of the pub, which is listed by the Guinness Book of Records as the remotest on mainland Britain. Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet has put it on the market at offers over £,.  Jacqui Wallace and Rhona Miller, co-chairs of the society’s management committee, said in a statement: “We are delighted that the SLF has chosen to support our community-ownership bid of The Old Forge. This project is of huge importance to Knoydart and we are now in a strong position to make it a reality.” The group’s structure as a community benefit society ensures that locals and supporters will be in control of the pub’s future, and the businesses operations are defined with community benefit at the forefront.  Profits are reinvested back into the business and other local projects, not distributed among shareholder members. Davie Newton, management committee member, said: “The Old Forge is on the market for offers over £,, but that figure does not include the owner’s asking price for goodwill of the business. “We are currently working with the owner to undertake an independent valuation of the goodwill, and once this has taken place, we will be able to assess and submit an appropriate offer. “  Shares started at £ for local residents, with non-resident applications having a higher minimum investment amount of £,. Of the  local residents, over  have offered to volunteer their time to the cause and working groups have been set up for all aspects of the project from business planning and fundraising to post-purchase management plans.

This is the worst I can remember in  years, writes Prof Martin Marshall, Chair of the Royal College of GPsThe reality is, there are simply not enough GPs, and those we do have are working under intense pressures Image: GettyopinionByProfessor Martin Marshall:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsThe relationship between a GP and their patient is based on trust, often built over time. GPs are consistently rated as some of the most trusted professionals in society. Yet that bond is under threat. Patient satisfaction rates in their GP practice actually rose during the pandemic to the highest in three years. According to the annual GP patient survey, % of patients say they have confidence and trust in the healthcare professional they saw and % say their needs were met when they last visited their local practice. Without being complacent, I’m not surprised because GPs and our teams have been working our socks off throughout the pandemic, delivering essential care and services when many other parts of the NHS shut down. We’ve ensured patients have been able to access care safely, in person where clinically necessary, in line with Government advice. We’ve ensured patients are protected from flu, which can be a serious illness for those at greatest risk, by rolling out the largest vaccine programme yet. And we’ve played a leading role in the Covid vaccination effort, protecting people from the virus that has blighted our lives for the last  months, with three quarters of all vaccines delivered in primary care. Yet over the last couple of months, GPs and our teams have been subjected to a torrent of unfair and frequently offensive criticism from certain parts of the UK’s media and some politicians. It’s been the worst I can remember in  years as a GP.  The root of it all is based on a concerning narrative that remote consultations aren’t as good as face to face appointments. It’s absolutely true that face-to-face appointments are often necessary – and they are happening. Almost  million patient appointments were made in August, % on the same day they were requested, and almost six in  are currently face to face. That’s nearly  million in a month. To claim face to face consulting isn’t happening is wrong. Many patients do prefer seeing their GP in person, and many GPs prefer seeing their patients in person. But good care can also be delivered remotely and some patients prefer it. GP appointments over the phone or online can be convenient and fit around other commitments, and they can make some people feel more comfortable to seek medical help when they need it or discuss things about their health they might be embarrassed to otherwise.  The latest onslaught has been about GPs working part time. Butyou actually look at the hours worked by a ‘part-time’ GP working three days a week, they are longer on average than what would be considered full time by most people – around  hours. A quarter of GPs are working  hours a week or more. To put that into context, a pilot is restricted to flying  hours over seven days – because doing more would be considered unsafe. GPs are making dficult, important decisions every day, in every consultation. Sometimes these are le or death decisions. Forcing GPs to work longer hours is dangerous. Patients shouldn’t have to see tired GPs. GPs, and other members of our teams, join the profession to care for patients. It is the relationships that we build with our patients that make the job worthwhile. I often say that a good relationship with a patient is to a GP what a scalpel is to a surgeon. It’s the most important tool we have. General practice teams are working so hard right now, trying to do their best for patients in as safe a way as possible. To consistently be told you’re not doing enough is demoralising. It’s having a dangerous impact our relationship with our patients, with numerous reports of practice staff being on the receiving end of abuse from frustrated patients. And it’s having an impact on the mental health and wellbeing of GPs and our teams.  A survey by the College earlier this year found % of GPs reporting their mental health has deteriorated over the last year. The same survey found that % of GPs said they were thinking of leaving the profession in the next five years - a quarter of those due to stress and burnout. That could mean , highly trained, experienced GPs leaving frontline patient care - at a time when we need thousands more to deliver the care we want to: the care our patients need and deserve. Our big fear is that this current unfair criticism, on top of existing pressures, will be the final straw for many GPs and other practice team members, causing them to leave the profession before their time. It also stops bright and brilliant medical students from training to become GPs, and the consequences will be serious. We share the frustrations of our patients, who are finding it more challenging to access our services. The reality is, there are simply not enough GPs, and those we do have are working under intense pressures. Workload is escalating, but GP numbers have fallen since the Government promise of , more family doctors was made. Patients need these GPs. We also need the , members of the wider practice team that were promised, and for unnecessary bureaucracy to be addressed, so we can spend more time with our patients. But the Government also needs to recognise that NHS pressures are not confined to hospitals and that general practice is under unprecedented strain. GPs, our teams, and colleagues right across the health service have worked to their limits over the last  months. Divisive and distorted accusations about ‘lazy’ and ‘uncaring’ GPs demoralise the very people who are going above and beyond every day to keep the NHS running safely for patients. Everyone deserves a family doctor. We need our patients, the public, politicians and the media to support our GPs – before it’s too late.

It is a signicant annual event that could have major ramications across the globe - but what does COP stand for Boris Johnson will be joined by US president Joe BidenByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Oct | comments Countries from across the planet are gearing up for COP, which will take place in Glasgow between Sunday  October and Friday  November.Boris Johnson will be joined by the likes of US president Joe Biden and the Queen. The climate change activist Greta Thunberg will also be in visiting, as will broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough.Despite joining the summit, Great Thunberg has been critical of the event. She told: Nothing has changed from previous years really. The leaders will say we’ll do this and we’ll do this, and we will put our forces together and achieve this, and then they will do nothing.Maybe some symbolic things and creative accounting and things that don’t really have a big impact. We can have as many Cops as we want, but nothing real will come out of it.” In the lead up to the summit, councils in Glasgow pledged to plant  million trees. What does COP stand for   The COP stands for aposConference of the Partiesapos and is a meeting of nearly every country on earth, joining for a global climate summit. This is the th edition of the summit and the UK will preside over the talks, which will take place in Glasgow. Minister of State at the Cabinet Office and former business secretary Alok Sharma will lead the conference as president. COP was particularly signicant and was where much of the Paris Climate Agreement was discussed and agreed. The agreementaposs main aim is to keep global temperatures from rising a further two degrees Celsius, and to pursue further efforts to keep it below .. What is the purpose of COP  We are facing a climate crisis and COP is supposed to be a chance for countries to create a coherent plan to tackle climate change.  One of the principal aims of COP is to accelerate the ways and means of achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change..As ukcop.org explains: Countries are being asked to come forward with ambitious  emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century.  The site also explains the general goals that will be discussed at the summit and the aim to apossecure global net zero by mid-century and keep . degrees within reachapos. To do this, countries must:accelerate the phase-out of coal curtail deforestation speed up the switch to electric vehicles encourage investment in renewables.The challenges that face world leaders who attend the conference are numerable.The UN notes that human activity is producing greenhouse gas emissions at a record high.They said: Glaciers and ice sheets in polar and mountain regions are already melting faster than ever, causing sea levels to rise. Almost two-thirds of the world’s cities with populations of over five million are located in areas at risk of sea level rise and almost  per cent of the world’s population live within  km of a coast. If no action is taken, entire districts of New York, Shanghai, Abu Dhabi, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, and many other cities could find themselves underwater within our letimes , displacing millions of people.

The first demonstrations took place on  September, where protestors blocked the M motorway. Many commuters were left angry at the inconveniences caused. A YouGov poll asking the question aposDo you have a favourable or unfavourable view of Insulate Britain apos was asked and only % answered aposvery favourableapos. % gave an answer of apossomewhat favourableapos and % said Insulate Britain are apossomewhat unfavourableapos. % of the people who answered the survey believe the group to be aposvery unfavourableapos.Prime Minister Boris Johnson branded the group as irresponsible crusties. Home secretary Priti Patel used the events to further her cause for the increase in police powers to combat protesting, which has drawn severe criticism due to fears the planned laws infringe on peopleaposs human right to free expression.Patel said: Measures already going through Parliament will ensure these criminals can be brought to justice for the disruption they are causing. But we are going further to close down the legal loopholes exploited by these offenders. Who are Insulate Britain and what are their goals   Insulate Britain began in August and are separate from the like of Extinction Rebellion in that their goals are far more specic. Their primary aim is to force the government to look at insulating Britainaposs aposleakyapos homes. Much of Britainaposs energy emissions are caused by homes that are not energy efficient. According to the National Housing Federation, England’s homes produce more carbon emissions every year than is produced by all of the country’s cars. They said: Nearly % of the UK’s total emissions comes from heating homes: an overhaul of the energy performance of the UK’s housing stock is needed to reduce the energy demand. In order to meet UK commitments under the Paris Agreement to stay below .C, and legal obligations under the Climate Change Act , as amended in , emissions from heating and powering homes must be reduced by % in less than  years and then to zero by . Their target is expensive and the Climate Change Committee believes that retrofitting the estimated  million homes would cost around £, each. This is an overall price tag of £ billion.

Speaking about her good fortune, she said: We had some friends drop in to have a look at the ious things myself and the others were selling.  After the event, we had so much cleaning to do that we decided to order McDonaldaposs rather than start cooking. I peeled off the label from my drink to find that I had won £,. I never thought anything like that would ever happen to me. I truly feel as though someone was looking down on me there. Iaposve got loads of birthdays to pay for and my wedding next year so this will definitely help to lighten the load. She added: My son did joke that he should have won the money because he was the one that ordered the large drink, but weaposre just excited to have actually won something. We received a note in the post telling us to send the sticker off to McDonaldaposs so they could very we had won.  The money just randomly dropped into my bank account the other day in the end. Lisa makes wax melts as a hobby and hopes to one day turn it into a full-time job.Iaposm quite excited to hopefully use some of the money to help expand my business, Milaposs Melts, too.The whole family have been great with helping me get set up and getting all the equipment I need, theyaposve all been absolute stars.

Researchers found that  percent of women have gone to great s throughout their lives to cover up spots, including wearing roll neck jumpers in summer and wrapping scarfs around their face. And over the past  months, more than half of the , women polled have enjoyed covering their faces with masks. Other tricks regularly deployed to hide bad skins include wearing hair loosely, growing a fringe and walking with their head down.  Half have also tried covering acne or spots up with layers of makeup, but fear it just makes things worse. Did you enjoy wearing a mask  Have your say in the comment section  Nearly three-quartersof women arenapost happy with their skin and have tried six products to attempt to fix it. And the average woman spends  minutes caring for her skin each day, spending an average of £ in the last year. The survey was commissioned by Polish dermacosmetics skincare brand Tolpa, which has launched its facial skincare products in the UK.  Kadeeja Sel Khan, an ambassador for Tolpa’s Nothing to Hide campaign, said: “It’s hard to see so many women struggle with the look of their skin, even when it’s such a natural and normal thing that we all go through.“I have acne-prone and very sensitive skin and it can definitely get my mood down sometimes. “Like many women, I used to find myself trying to hide my skin – but I have embraced the natural look and began using products that show the reality behind the filter, that actually work, which has made a huge dference.”  The survey also found  percent of women consider their skin to be the most important part of their appearance. Concerningly,  percent said there has been a time when they haven’t left their house because of their skin, and one in ten have even lost out on opportunities because of their spots. Furthermore,  percent have turned to home-made remedies including putting toothpaste on a spot, and honey face masks and apple cider vinegar in a bid to clear their skin.  And while  percent are dubious that these at home remedies work, they are willing to try anything. Cucumber and teabags on eyes, toothpaste on spots and OTC antiseptics top the list of the most popular DIY products. Charcoal and glue facemasks, surgical spirit and apple cider vinegar toner are also methods women commonly use. But  percent said they didn’t notice a dference in their skin after using an at-home remedy, and some even said it made their skin worse.  The research, carried out via OnePoll, shows three in ten tried these remedies as they were desperate to have better skin. It also emerged that  percent look for products that combine natural and scientically proven ingredients, while  percent are always on the look out for skincare with innovative ingredients. Dr Alia Ahmed, independent consultant dermatologist to Tolpa, said: “It’s clear people use these remedies out of desperation, but they may cause further problems, so I usually advise against this. “It’s great that people are now looking for products that combine the best from nature with scientically proven ingredients, as this is something I recommend. “Acne affects quality of le and has considerable psychological, social and emotional impact. “As the stats show, sadly, the psychological impact of acne affects several aspects of daily le, including the ability to socialise, and can limit occupational opportunities.”To find out more, visit the Lloyds Pharmacy page.Top  home remedies for spotsCucumber on eyes Toothpaste on spots Tea bags on eyes OTC antisepticsHoney face masks Lemon juice Sugar scrub Oat face mask Facial wash made from essential oils Coconut oil to remove makeup Apple cider vinegar toner Baking soda face scrub Fruit mask Turmeric face mask Charcoal and glue facemasksMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON AcneSkincare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr Wesley Ely from Nashville, US, posted a video of -year-old Autumn Nugent walking with her new prosthetic legs after medics were forced to amputate her limbs due to complications from the virus. He said Autumn pleaded with him to share her story in a desperate bid to encourage others to get the jab. Dr Ely captioned the video: “Covid took her hands and feet. “I cried when she sent me this yesterday: Her physical resilience and mental fortitude are my inspiration.” Issuing an emotional vaccine plea on behalf of Autumn, he tweeted: “She sent this of her walking with new legs and said to tell you…Blood clots of Covid can be prevented with a vaccine!”  Dr Ely previously released a series of tweets detailing the mum-of-threeaposs devastating journey with Covid- as she requested. He wrote: “Covid- is a disease of blood vessels that can affect your lungs, heart, brain, or any organ. Blood clotting sucks le from vital organs. “This patient asked to have her story shared so that others may learn and seek vaccination.” The medic explained that complications from the virus caused blood clots in Autumnaposs arms and legs, resulting in wounds that resembled burns. “It took nurses many hours each day to change her wounds,” he said. As Autumn continue to battle with the virus Dr Ely said it became clear that there would be a costshe was to survive. “She was going to live, and we were all thrilled. Still, it was sad to think that this young woman would lose her hands and feet as they continued to dry up, leless and still,” he said. Dr Ely posted a photo of Autumn with a nurse in the hospital courtyard which was taken a week after she underwent the amputations. He said: “Her desire for le became a huge inspiration to all of us. I gained way more from her than she ever gained from me. Autumn had to endure gruelling physical therapy while taking more than  dferent medications every day in the weeks that followed which meant she had to overcome immense physical and mental barriers. “Here you can see her during rehabilitation just after she finished doing some amazing planks. Even with healing wounds, she was doing  minutes of planking – such is her physical and mental strength!” Dr Ely wrote about her progress. Autumn was gted a set of prosthetics with her sister’s and kidsapos names on them to give her hope and motivation during her recovery.  Dr Ely revealed that he and Autumn have become close through her journey and she even calls him dad. He said: “I call her my daughter, and she calls me a new dad .She is a treasure beyond measure for me. I don’t deserve her in my le, but I’m totally thankful she accepts me. “She said, “Please, Doctor Wes, share my story to help others get the vaccine.”  Issuing his own warning for people to get the jab, he said: “Her le is forever changed...This is the reality of what can happen to a very young and totally healthy person. But he ended the thread on a slightly more positive tone. “Le goes on no matter how hard the curve balls are that we are thrown. There is hope for tomorrow. Love of her kids and sisters is driving her onwards, he said. “Very few drugs have such a great safety profile. Covid patients want to get vaccinated and many have asked you to reconsider... Do your part and share her story and its message of hope. Make her courage to share worth it!” A fundraiser has been launched to help pay towards Autumnaposs medical care.You can make a donation here.Comment MORE ON HospitalsHeart diseasePrescriptionsTherapyHandsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I drive a six-cylinder Audi and it sounds pretty okay when you rev it up so I figured oh well Iaposll just give them a couple of revs to redline for fun, they might like that. So I give it a good rev, and another as I got up to them. Right about then, I notice the first legible sign is a painting of earth, with help fight pollution underneath....they pretty much all looked like.They took it as a huge f*** you and now I feel like an idiot. Understandably, lots of people had one key piece of advice for the hapless driver - get glasses as soon as possible. Another wrote: Lmaoooooo, I totally feel you.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-praises-outstanding-initiative","story":"The Ridge started  years ago as a community-run garden for residents and visitors to Dunbar to enjoy.Since then, the group has taken control of a number of sites in the town, including one in the Backlands and one on Empire Close.The two garden sites have been transformed from derelict and disused land behind the townrsquos High Street into green spaces for the whole community.Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, was impressed with the work being carried out.He said: ldquoThe Ridge is an outstanding community-based initiative which is committed to supporting residents of Dunbar who need support.ldquoI want to pass on my thanks to Kate Darrah, Gill Last and the wider team of staff, volunteers and apprentices at The Ridge for all of the work they have been doing in improving the lives of people from the local community and restoring Dunbarrsquos heritage.The Ridge provides SQA-approved training in stone masonry and joinery for young people from local schools, as well as apprenticeships for those out of education.The projectrsquos support team also offers help and advice for residents of the town, and volunteers from The Ridge make up lsquoSunny Soupsrsquo, which can be collected from the free food freezer in the Bleachingfield Centre ndash using food that would otherwise go to landfill to help combat food poverty in the area.Mr Hoy, who also represents the Haddington and Lammermuir ward on East Lothian Council, added: ldquoThe technical training offered by The Ridge to young people in stone masonry and joinery is sorely missing from the wider education system, and the projectrsquos support team and Sunny Soups have been essential for many East Lothian residents.Kate Darrah, founder and managing director of The Ridge, was keen to offer help to people in the area.She said: ldquoWe aim to support people to overcome challenges to be able to enjoy le to the full.ldquoSometimes thatrsquos just about the chance to connect with other people through volunteering.ldquoIf we canrsquot help directly, we have many strong partnership relationships with other organisations and can signpost quickly and effectively.

The safety-first approach right now protects Mr Brennans daughter, staff and the rest of the student population, and is the best way to get us back to some form of normality in the future.Letrsquos remember that university employees shted learning, student support and research online overnight when the pandemic hit. Ever since, they have been working even harder to deliver high-quality education, with hybrid, blended and digital learning adding to workloads and far from the easy options Mr Brennan implies. We know students want online learning choices, giving them more accessibility to learning at a pace and time that suits, which together with live discussion provides a complete learning experience.Universities arenrsquot nightclubs. Itrsquos crucial that they are safe spaces for students and staff with underlying health issues or vulnerabilities too. This means continuing with a cautious and safety-first approach, which puts the health and wellbeing of your readerrsquos daughter, staff and the rest of the student population first.Mary Senior, University and College Union, Glasgow.* I NOTE with interest Steve Brennans letter. I have friends currently supporting student children on courses asking themselvesthe current arrangements are adequate and provide the high-value education they are paying for. Our students have been having a hard time of it over the past  months and now on top of Covid there is a shortage of accommodation. This is particularly acute around Glasgow due to the upcoming COP conference, and some have nowhere to stay.Irsquom sure that there are many parents who will be thinking that this might not be a good time for their child to embark on a university course, but the reality is we need a steady supply of young people with a broad base of skills to keep our economy going and our employers provided with adequate numbers of skilled people. Universities have a role in ensuring that they can provide these people. Believe me, you donrsquot want to phone the dentist when you have toothache to be told they donrsquot have a dentist, as ldquothere is a shortage as none graduated this year.It would appear to me that the world will have to live with Covid- for some time to come indeed this may be as good as it gets, so it would be good to hearthere are plans for the universities toto some semblance of normality. If not now, then when Ian Higgins, Airdrie.A SAD WASTE OF NHS RESOURCESHAVING attended my consultant at an eye clinic in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, my prescription for eye drops was changed. I duly explained this to my GP surgery receptionist, when requesting a new prescription. I collected the packet, and discovered when home that I had been given the former, and not the new drops.I phoned the surgery and was told that as they hadnt received notication of the change, I would need to contact the hospital and chase up the required letter, which I did. I then contacted the chemist, and advised them of the change and offered tothe mistaken prescription, which they said I could do, but the drops would have to be destroyed. As it happens, they are single-phial drops, in sealed \"envelopes\", in unopened boxes, and I only collected them two days ago. No matter, for the tiresome \"health and safety\" mantra, they have to be destroyed, and no, they cannot be donated to a third world country.I believe a similar situation pertains with, for example, urine and blood sample bottles. When a box is opened, and is discovered to contain the wrong type of bottle, the whole consignment is destroyed. I am sure there are many other examples of such profligacy. Its akin to burning pound notes. It wouldnt matter how much money is thrown at the NHS, it still wouldnt be efficient.Lesley Mackiggan, Glasgow.LETS NOT GET LOST IN SPACEWILLIAM Shatner, aged , wants to travel to space in order that he can see what he needs to do to save the planet.

Yes, rain-soaked Scotland really is short of water.The issue of course is not about a lack of water per se, but a lack of water that is safe to drink. That article had people from both SEPA and Scottish Water saying that maintaining some public water supplies was a ldquosignicant challenge after the second driest summer in  years.It is certainly counter-intuitive, as I look out of the window while writing this and see rivulets of water gushing down the gutters once again, to be hearing calls to conserve water. But the experts are right. Climate change is having many adverse impacts on our reality in Scotland today, and this is one of them. At Citizens Advice Scotland, we advocate for the consumer interest in a number of public services, one of them being water. And there is one group of people who can be particularly vulnerable to these trends, and that is those who rely on private water supplies. These can be single households or whole communities, and their supply systems can y from a simple pipe directing water from a nearby stream to their homes using basic filters, to more robust treatment structures. But the point is they are not part of the public water system and so lack the protections enjoyed by the rest of us.In July, a private water community in South Ayrshire ran out of water. Without any warning, peoplesrsquo water just stopped coming out of their taps. The local MSP, Elena Whitham, called the issue a lsquohumanitarian crisisrsquo. You might think that language is a bit over the top  If you do, try living without your water source for  hours.Of course, Irsquom not actually suggesting you do that. Depriving yourself and your family of clean water to drink, wash and cook with is dangerous. But hopefully the thought is enough to make the point.In that Ayrshire case the government stepped in to provide bottled water until the supply was restored but for those affected in the meantime, this was a very serious issue. And lack of supply is not the only problem. Therersquos also the issue of water quality. Many private water supplies are not required to test their water for safety. As a result, the quality of the water may be sub-standard, containing things such as E.Coli. Treatment processes, y and wersquove even heard anecdotal evidence of people straining their water with hospital stockings. Hopefully yoursquoll agree that therersquos a problem here that requires some attention.Letrsquos start by busting a couple of common myths about private water supplies. Myth number : the numbers of people who use a private supply are tiny. Well, in fact more than , people in Scotland rely on one. Imaginethey all lived in the same place. Thatrsquos a city not much smaller than Aberdeen. If Aberdeenrsquos water supply was sporadic and unsafe, I think wersquod all agree we need to fix that.Myth number two: private water supplies only exist for remote dwellers, eccentric tree-hugging types whorsquove chosen to live that way so knew the risks. In fact, the vast majority of those who rely on a private supply did not choose to do so. Itrsquos just the place they were born or had to move to for employment.The fact that private supplies are disproportionately concentrated in rural areas means there is a risk of growing inequality in terms of access to safe drinking water across Scotland. The ability of the rural community and economy to thrive is fundamentally based on its ability to access safe drinking water, and this is being threatened by climate change impacts such as lower rainfall during the summer months ndash as we saw this year, and in three of the last four years.Think about this too. Problems with private supplies donrsquot just affect the people who live there. If yoursquove spent a holiday or a day-trip to Argyll or the Highlands therersquos a good chance yoursquove stayed in a hotel or eaten in a restaurant that is served by a private supply. Looked at that way, the figure of , people affected is a low estimate.So, in partnership with the Drinking Water Quality Regulator, CAS recently commissioned research to support the development of more resilient and empowered private supply communities.The evidence suggests that lack of information and training, the complexity of water treatment and maintenance, and issues of affordability all combine to mean water quantity and quality are never guaranteed for private water supply users. This could present a very real threat to public health for a large group of people.Scotland has made an international commitment to ensure access to safe drinking water for all its citizens, in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as a national commitment to keep pace with EU law, which recognises water as a human right and requires action to improve access. CAS is working collaboratively with key stakeholders to identy ways of meeting these.With COP just weeks away, Scotland needs to showcase our commitment to sustainability. A lot of attention is focusing, quite rightly, on energy efficiency. But we mustnrsquot overlook the issues around water as well. Private water consumers must have the support they need to secure their capacity and build resilience to climate change impacts.Emma Ash is a senior policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"tom322-x3322-tui-plane-declares-squawk-7700","story":"The TUI Airways flight, travelling from Aberdeen to Tenere, declared the emergency around half an hour into its four-hour journey.It declared a Squawk  while flying near Glasgow.An emergency squawk is used to identy an aircraft that has a possible issue and enables it to have priority over other air traffic.It has been confirmed to The Herald that the flight was erted due to a cabin crew member requiring urgent medical attention.The flight made a u-turn while traveling over East Ayrshire, and landed at Glasgow Airport at around pm.A spokeswoman for TUI said: \"We can confirm that flight TOM from Aberdeen to Tenere has erted to Glasgow as a result of a crew member requiring urgent medical attention.\"The flight will continue to Tenere as soon as possible, and we would like to thank passengers for their patience and understanding at this time.\"The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-scotland-limbo-line-duty-run-lead-nominations","story":"The very best talent in film, games, and television produced in Scotland are set to be honoured in a digital ceremony which will be held next month.Kelly Macdonald, Martin Compston and David Tennant have been named among this yearrsquos nominees.Limbo, a film directed by Ben Sharrock, which centres on the refugee experience of four Syrians as they seek asylum on a remote Scottish island has led with five coveted nominations in the best film, director, writer and actor categories.Police drama Line of Duty picked up three nominations, including Audience Award Nominations for Scot stars Martin Compston and Kelly Macdonald, while Run, a film which explores drag racing in Fraserburgh, picked up three nominations in total including best feature film and a nomination for Mark Stanley for best film actor.Edith Bowman will host the socially distanced, closed-studio show at BBC Pacic Quay alongside Sanjeev Kohli and other guest presenters on Saturday, November .As well as high profile actors, there are a wealth of first time nominees at this yearrsquos awards including Vikash Bhai and Amir El-Masry from Limbo, who are both up for the film actor category and Irune Gurtubai and Limbo director Ben Sharrock, nominated for the feature film category.Sharrock also finds himself in the writer television film and director - fiction categories.Tamara Lawrence from Kindred is nominated in the film actress category, Abigail Lawrie of Tin Star: Liverpool has been nominated in the television actress category, Eva Riley is also nominated for best director for Perfect , while Mark Stanley and Marli Siu from run are nominated in the film actor and actress categories.Speaking about this yearrsquos nominations Jude MacLaverty, director of BAFTA Scotland said: ldquoNew Scottish talent is really exciting, some of the nominees this year have been nominated for a new talent award with us so Irsquom really excited to see them on the list alongside the likes of established talent who have been nominated and won before like Jack Lowden, James McAvoy, Kelly McDonald - Peter Mullan is on his eleventh.Ms Bowman added: ldquoI think its great that theres so so many first time nominees on the list, which is testament to both the encouragement and support thats there for the industry, but then this standard of productions and performances that are coming through both in terms of front of camera stuff, also behind the scenes as well.ldquoFor me, thats just thats what, this whole list is about is really celebrate that, and all the hard work that everybodys done, particularly with restrictions that are still imposed on on things and how so much great material and productions and performances are being able to sort of shine through considering what everybodys been under.ldquoI think what was incredible was seeing how quick people found a way of continuing.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

He gave an alcohol reading or  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is more than six times the limit.Just a week later, in the early hours of th August, officers on patrol noticed Willmottrsquos car with its lights on in a layby of the A near Voe,Willmott was in the driving seat, with the keys in the ignition. Although the engine was off at the time, officers noticed a rear brake disk was still warm.Willmott was again arrested and taken to the police station. This time he gave a reading of  microgrammes per ml of breath, which is almost four times the legal limit.Mr MacKenzie said the test readings were ldquoextremely high.He applied for the sherf to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, valued at between pound,, and pound,, as part of sentencing.He said the fact Willmott was caught twice in a week showed he was potentially a ldquosignicant risk to the public, which could be ldquomitigated by depriving him of access to his motor vehicle.ldquoHe may well be someone whose judgement is so impaired by his addiction that the risk remains very high, Mr MacKenzie said.ldquoHe has simply not been able to cope, he said.ldquoHe is terried about going to jail,# he added.Mr Allan appealed for the sherf not to forfeit Willmottrsquos car, which he was still paying off to a finance company.He said even at the cheapest estimates it was a ldquosignicant penalty to someone who is at the moment going through the process of applying for universal credit.Sherf Cruickshank agreed not to forfeit the car, saying the financial impact on Willmott would be ldquodisproportionate.He said the community payback order, requiring supervision for  months, was an alternative to custodial sentence.Willmott was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work over a year.He was disqualied from driving for  months for each of the two charges, although the period of the ban can be reduced by a quarterhe takes a drink driving awareness course.A man who crashed into the front of a house after a high speed police chase while almost five times over the drink drive limitPupils’ artwork has been damaged by vandals.A dangerous driver almost caused a crash near Lerwick last week.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4155553.jpg--.jpg?1634111605000\n","title":"9000 applicants but emma scoops global leadership selection","story":"Local barrister, Emma McIlveen has been selected for the British Council’s prestigious global policy programme, ‘Future Leaders Connect.’ Emma, who specialises in Employment Law will gain exclusive access to policy experts and training, discuss policy ideas with UK Parliamentarians and Government and be mentored by UK think tanks and other senior leaders.In partnership with the prestigious Moslashller Institute at Cambridge University, Future Leaders Connect aims to help delegates develop their skills, expand their networks and ultimately, make policy change.The former Ballymena Academy pupil was selected from over , applicants worldwide and as part of the process, had to pitch her global policy vision – choosing to focus on family friendly policies in the workplace.Speaking ahead of the programme, Emma said: “I applied for Future Leaders Connect, having studied law and politics at Queen’s and always having a passion for using my legal knowledge to truly make a dference. “Given the fact that this is Northern Ireland’s centenary year, I felt this was an excellent opportunity to develop my policy vision and make my ideas a reality.“Through this programme, I will be exploring how Northern Ireland can introduce more family friendly policies to support female empowerment advancement.“In particular, I will be advocating for more investment in state funded childcare, more flexibility around the taking of maternity leaveand more support for breastfeeding in public spaces.”For this Centenary year, the programme has been expanded in Northern Ireland to ten places instead of the usual two.The Northern Ireland Office has supported the programme which has allowed Emma to be joined on the programme by nine other delegates from all throughout Northern Ireland.Across the six week programme, the participants will have the opportunity to connect with emerging leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Ukraine, Vietnam and the rest of the UK.Congratulating Emma, as well as the nine other Northern Ireland participants, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, said: “I’m proud that the Northern Ireland Office is supporting the expansion of the programme this Centenary year, meaning more young people from Northern Ireland will be taking part.“It’s a fantastic opportunity for them to hear from leaders around the world and learn how governments can work together to tackle the great global issues of the day.”Also speaking about the programme, Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland said: “We’re delighted to be able to announce the ten exceptional iniduals from Northern Ireland taking part in this year’s global programme.“Future Leaders Connect is an opportunity for emerging leaders in Northern Ireland to collaborate with their counterparts from all over the world, and to benefit from the sharing of ideas and knowledge in tackling global issues and challenges.“The application process was extremely competitive, and we are certain that our ten young leaders whose backgrounds range from law and politics to housing and the environment, will make positive changes in Northern Ireland.“We wish them every success in the programme.”This year’s Future Leaders Connect programme will officially kick off from  October and run for six weeks online until  November.

Mr Blair was also ordered to pay £ towards the council’s costs and £ in legal costs.Referring to the case, a spokesperson for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council said it “gives a high priority to the welfare of domestic pets and horses and operates a rigorous enforcement policy to ensure full compliance of regulatory requirements”.“Complaints are investigated thoroughly and where necessary, formal action is taken, which may include the service of Improvement Notices, or in extreme cases, seizure of animals,” said a spokesperson.“The council may also prosecute for offences such as in this case which I hope serves as a warning to anyone who does not take appropriate care of animals”.Last month, this newspaper reported that four dogs were rescued after being nearly starved to death in Carrickfergus, while a father and son from the Ballyclare area were heavily fined and banned from keeping animals after being found in filthy conditions.If you have concerns about the welfare of an animal, contact the Northern Region Animal Welfare Team on    or send a email to animal.welfare@midandeastantrim.gov.uk..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilMore On Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council PremiumBelfast City Council’s eight-year long glass recycling trial ‘has to end’Rural homes: Sympathetic design and green heating key elements of £.m schemeSDLP hits out at ‘unjustiable’ pay increase for Antrim and Newtownabbey councillorsAntrim and Newtownabbey council defers decision on some job cutsUnion criticises #disgraceful# plans to axe  Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council jobs due to pandemicMost ReadNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusKnockloughrim murder: ‘Shock and disbelief’ in rural community after woman dies in car fireMurder investigation launched after woman dies in Co Derry car blazeTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car fire \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertPlaySir Kenneth Branagh reveals how lockdown inspired film about childhoodLatest Northern IrelandPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocolMother who died in car blaze witnessed fatal accident that claimed daughterRonnie O’Sullivan sets ‘flat’ comment straight for Belfast snooker fans: ‘They’re like family to me’LatestHamilton star alleges they lost role after requesting gender-neutral facilitiesNetflix renews thriller series You for a fourth seasonPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A spokesperson added: Numerous factors, from access to staff and dficulties in vehicle supply due to the current semi-conductors crisis and the related fleet shortage, to the increased levels of cleaning between rentals weigh on the costs for the rental sector as a whole.Had Belfast native Colin been going in the opposite direction, and seeking to hire a car in France, he could have had a luxury Range Rover Velar — which costs nearly £, new — for the same money.He also revealed that he’d paid less than £ back in May  for BOTH his flights to and from Northern Ireland and car rental.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I kept my receipt, which shows it cost just €.to hire a car from May  until May  in Northern Ireland two years ago,” he told this newspaper.“When I priced a similar car this time, the hire cost from October  until November  was between £, and £, for the cheapest vehicles.”Research from the Belfastdiscovered that it is possible to hire cheaper vehicles, but we also found that there are signicant iations in price, depending on the website you choose.We also discovered that higher prices are quotedyou are inquiring online from the EU, with the average hike around %. Colin said he consulted the Europcar site, which he’d used previously as it’s linked to the airline with which he is flying.Bewildered by the results, he revealed that he’d also looked at the price of hiring vehicles in Paris for the sake of comparison.“I decided to price an equivalent rental period in Paris and it was almost the exact same pricefor a Range Rover,” he said.“That’s quite a bargain, compared with the Vauxhall Crossland [worth £,] you’d get for the same money in Belfast.The -year-old continued: “Whatever way you look at it, the price of renting a vehicle in Northern Ireland has gone up by an astronomical amount.”Mr Young, who was hoping to hire a small car, said the cheapest available options he was quoted were a Vauxhall Corsafor £,. or a Crossland Xat £,..The pick-up and drop-off point on both vehicles on both dates was Belfast International Airport. “When I hired a car back in May  it worked out around £. a day,” he said.“ButI wanted to rent a similar vehicle this October, you’re talking about £. per day being advertised.”Colin, who lives with his partner Cecile and their son Joelin the French capital, made his original booking with Europcar, which he also consulted ahead of this year’s trip.But he revealed that he also checked the cost of car rental on other comparison websites, but found “they were all coming up the same”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusKnockloughrim murder: ‘Shock and disbelief’ in rural community after woman dies in car fireMurder investigation launched after woman dies in Co Derry car blazeTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car fire \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertPlaySir Kenneth Branagh reveals how lockdown inspired film about childhoodLatest Northern IrelandPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocolMother who died in car blaze witnessed fatal accident that claimed daughterRonnie O’Sullivan sets ‘flat’ comment straight for Belfast snooker fans: ‘They’re like family to me’LatestHamilton star alleges they lost role after requesting gender-neutral facilitiesNetflix renews thriller series You for a fourth seasonPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I had the opportunity to put strongly worded questions to Brandon Lewis about the British government’s legacy proposals and to put forward my views.“He was very engaging and responded directly. I told him the proposed amnesty will massively harm Britain’s standing in the US and urged him not to go ahead with it.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I was surprised to get the invitation to meet him. The AOH was grateful of the opportunity to outline our views.”The Northern Ireland Office has been contacted for comment.The New York lawyer was banned from the UK in  but defied the authorities, appearing at an anti-internment rally in west Belfast. In an attempt to arrest him, the RUC stormed the crowd and shot dead Sean Downes with a plastic bullet. The ban was lted six years later.Once a close confidant of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, Mr Galvin parted ways with Sinn Fein during the late s, becoming a staunch critic of the peace process and accusing the party of “abandoning republicanism”.He spoke at events supporting dissident republican prisoners and was a personal friend of Real IRA leader Mickey McKevitt and his we Bernadette Sands McKevitt.In his role as Freedom for All-Ireland chair in the AOH, Mr Galvin works with nationalist Troubles victims, campaign groups and others including Sinn Fein.AOH national vice-president Sean Pender accompanied the ex-Noraid leader to the meeting. “It lasted around  minutes. It was at British offices off Second Avenue. I led republican demonstrations to very near that location during the hunger-strike,” said Mr Galvin.“I told Brandon Lewis the amnesty proposal would represent the British government’s final cover-up in Ireland.“The AOH has been supporting the Ballymurphy massacre and Bloody Sunday families and many others for decades. An amnesty would not draw a line under the past but add a new chapter of hurt and injustice.“It wouldn’t herald an end to the battle for legacy truth but begin fresh court challenges that will cut across new generations. The Stormont House Agreement should be implemented.“I hope Brandon Lewis rethinks the proposals. He can be in no doubt of the opposition in Irish America, including in Congress, to them. Combined with that in Ireland, it has the potential to cause uproar and seriously harm his government’s credibility across the world.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsIRABrandon LewisMore On IRA PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionNationalists can’t trust Boris Johnson... but neither can unionists PremiumGarfield Beattie: From UVF Glenanne murder gang member to painter of republican iconsNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingFormer NIO boss Sir John Chilcot involved in IRA peace talks dies PremiumReport uncovers failures by police during probe into officer’s murderMost ReadNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offThe final cover up in Ireland: Ex-Noraid chief and IRA supporter Galvin in legacy talks with NI Secretary LewisNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusKnockloughrim murder: ‘Shock and disbelief’ in rural community after woman dies in car fireMurder investigation launched after woman dies in Co Derry car blazeTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car fire \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news efff .ece AUTOCROP wh fafeaedaedccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Viable device discovered during east Belfast alertPlaySir Kenneth Branagh reveals how lockdown inspired film about childhoodLatest Northern IrelandPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocolMother who died in car blaze witnessed fatal accident that claimed daughterRonnie O’Sullivan sets ‘flat’ comment straight for Belfast snooker fans: ‘They’re like family to me’LatestHamilton star alleges they lost role after requesting gender-neutral facilitiesNetflix renews thriller series You for a fourth seasonPaddy McClean is the hero for Glentoran amid League Cup penalty drama at GlenavonJonte Smith sends Ballymena United into League Cup quarter-finals as extra time header knocks out CrusadersBrussels ‘preparing for worst’ from UK after setting out changes to NI protocol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

Dawn McLaughlin was speaking at the Londonderry Chamber’s President’s Annual Dinner in the Everglades Hotel in the city. Attended by over  business leaders, politicians, and civic leaders, the dinner was the first major Chamber event since March . googletag.cmd.push Sponsored by Find Insurance NI, the dinner was hosted by former broadcast journalist Sarah Travers and featured a ‘fireside chat’ with RTEacute Europe Editor and Brexit expert Tony Connelly, who is originally from the city. Dawn McLaughlin said now is the time for elected representatives, candidates, and ministers to prioritise Derry and the North West as we move closer to next year’s election and has called on parties to work constructively to rebuild the local economy after the impact of the pandemic. Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Seamus Crossan ran  miles in  hours to raise poundk for Belmont CottagesDerry NewsDerry man runs  miles in  hours to raise poundk for wheelchair accessible vehicle for Belmont Cottages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Damian Brown pictured with his father Sean Brown during his playing days with Bellaghy.Local NewsTributes paid to gentleman Damian overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, has accused the DUP of setting themselves on a destructive course of action designed to antagonise nationalistsLocal NewsEastwood: Unionist threat of blocking Nationalist First Minister is insulting and pathetic overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The -year-old has been fundraising to buy a wheelchair accessible vehicle for the residents at Belmont Cottages. He trainedrigorouslyfor months to prepare himself for the challenge. Seamus, an avid runner, has been running a minimum of k every day consecutively since . googletag.cmd.push Speaking of his running he said: “I wanted my challenge to continue to mean something when I ran to  days. “I had been injured for the end of  and then I planned to do RED January, Run Every Day in January in . “I completed January and my mate Stephen suggested we do February too so it just spiraled from there.“I kept planning milestones after that one year, then  days, and then two years. “Once two years were completed, I decided I was going to do a fundraiser and aimed to get to  days and run  miles on the last day.” Seamus, who is a manager at Apex Housing Association, who manage Belmont Cottages, decided to fundraise for the cottages aftera dficult time for the residents as a result of the pandemic. “The last  months have been extremely dficult and challenging for the residents of Belmont Cottages due to the COVID restrictions. “We had limited use of transport forresidents due to the restrictions and this caused a lot of challenges and dficulties.     “We wanted to raise funds to get ourselves a wheelchair accessible people carrier to allow the freedom to get out and about without relying on others.” Seamus has smashed his target for the much-needed vehicle as the public continue to donate. Apex Housing Association tweeted: “We’re so proud of this man! Big thanks to everyone who supported his fundraising efforts over the last few months!” Seamus added: “I want to give amassive thank you to the team in the background and to Star Running Club. “Thank you to everyone that donated, cheered us on, or ran with us over the  hours. “A special mention of thanks to my best mate Stephen Quigley, who also ran every mile with me, I couldn’t have done it without everyone’s help and support. “We at Belmont Cottages were overwhelmed by the support and generosity of the Derry public to help us achieve and raise more than expected.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry.

St Canices Wellbeing Group was recently formed with a view to offer confidential support and advice on a wide range of issues including mental health, addiction, sexuality, diet, health and bereavement. googletag.cmd.push On Sunday , the group host its first ever event – a k walk in support of World Mental Health Day. Dozens of people turned out to take part in what the committee hope will be the first of many events. St Canices GAC Chairman Kieran McKeever is just one of the committee members of the wellbeing group. He said a demand for support and services on emotional wellbeing, mental health and other issues was identied in the local area and committee members from sports clubs decided to come together to form the new group. “Its well known that mental health, obesity and addiction issues are really common nowadays and we thought that maybe we should take the lead and show people out there in the community that there is a bit of help there for anyone who may need it,” he said. “It started off as a small group but then we got members from the soccer club, the ladies football team, the camogie team and the football team involved so we could expand out and everyone could have access to the service.” The Wellbeing Group has also teamed up with ALPS , a community-based mental health initiative which has a satellite office in Dungiven, to provide additional support and services to the community.     St Canices Wellbeing committee member Julie-Anne Moore said: “The main aim of the group is to highlight the help and support that is available out there. At the minute,people go through the health service, the waiting lists are massive. We are able to signpost people to the support that is available out there. “As a result of covid, we have seen that many issues are coming to the fore and really we are just trying to be pro-active and raise more awareness and show people we are here and there is always someone to listen. “We would like to stress that everything is confidential and it wont be people in the committee that you will be talking to, itll be trained professionals. “We will also be covering all age groups and hope to organise a number of events and workshops in the future in conjunction with the local schools. It is never too early to start talking to children and discuss any issues they may have with them.” Sinn Feacutein Councillor Sean McGlinchey is also a committee member of St Canices Wellbeing Group. Welcoming the addition of the group to the community, he said no matter the issue, big or small, he would encourage anyone who is in need of support or help to reach out. “I would very much welcome this group which I would stress is for all sections of the community. It will be all confidential and I am confident it will provide a much needed service in the community,” he said. “Many people are facing uncertain times ahead with furlough ending and the possibility of people facing unemployment and this will have an impact on peoples mental health so this is a service that we need.” Just one of the services St Canices Wellbeing Group are offering is free CPR and Defibrillator training. The course, which will teach lesaving skills, will be held in St Canices GAC main hall every Thursday from October . “There are defibrillators all around the town and many of us wouldnt know what to do in an emergency or provide basic CPR so we have decided to hold this training,” Kieran McKeever explained. “The CPR and defibrillator training is open to everyone, you dont have to associated with any of the sports clubs however we would advise booking as we can only accommodate ten people per week however we intend to run the course until demand is met.” Participants will receive a certicate on completion of the course. To express an interest or to book your slot, please private mail the clubs Facebook page or text    .

It just would not be tolerated.ldquoThis situation is compounded by the fact that, outside of the post-primary sector, not one single centre of learning in Derry City is providing A Level Irish for adult learners or ers.ldquoHow has this situation been allowed to develop and where will our future naacuteiscoil, bunscoil and meaacutenscoil teachers, not to mention our university lecturers, come fromurgent remedial action is not taken to reverse this sad decline  I do not understand how anyone, with direct or indirect responsibility for Irish education, has allowed this to happen.Speaking to the Derry News, Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the Director of Education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the ldquocritical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who ldquofelt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action.They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Gael Linn is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation focused on the promotion of the Irish language and the arts.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein said: ldquoThe legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals will have to realise that the Irish language is more than a school subject. In some schools in the area this is already the case.ldquoFor many, Irish is their native language and, therefore, they should have every opportunity to learn it to the highest level in education. It needs to be facilitated, not made dficult. If the system makes it dficult or less desirable to study a given subject, what will happen inside a number of years is that there will be a decreased demand, where there was once was a greater organic demand.ldquoConversely,we start with the view, whatever happens, we must offer Irish in our school, things will be better for the Irish and its learning.ldquoThe problem of Year  students, in other areas, who chose Irish A Level being unable to study it as a result of time-tabling issues, between schools and their area learning community, has been brought to the attention of Gael Linn. It often starts further down the school when pupils choose Irish and by doing so miss out on another language or subject, or choose another subject and miss out on Irish.RELATEDAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonldquoThere is a perception Irish is marked more severely than other subjects and both teachers and pupils know it may be more dficult to achieve and A*. If students do not study Irish in the first place, for instance, they will not take it later on or at college.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein added that the system made it dficult for pupils to opt for Irish and other languages and then claims there is little or no demand for the subject.ldquoI do not think this is equitable, he said. ldquoEvery effort should be made so that all pupils can study Irish, or other languages, to A Level and in the case of pupils from Gaelscoileanna, it is obvious that the continuity in language learning should be in place.ldquoIf there was legislation in place to promote Irish language rights, as promised in the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, these are precisely the issues a Commissioner for the Irish language would address. A Commissioner could ensure equitable access to Irish language as far as University, which is more than just a school subject.ldquoUlster University, Magee, has an excellent reputation for the study of Irish and one would have thought, therefore, that all the schools in the area, where Irish would have been traditionally offered, would do their best to offer Irish to A Level as a key into university, the local university in particular.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein was confident the situation could be reversed.He recalled: ldquoIn , Irish teachers and supporters came together to campaign for the overturning of a proposal, which at the time was being brought forward by the then Minister of Education, Brian Mawhinney. The proposal would have marginalised and downgraded the Irish language. This campaign was successful.ldquoWhat is happening now across the North is Mawhinney by the backdoor, in my opinion. Irish and other languages are being marginalised and their importance downgraded. This makes me sad but ready to campaign for our special native language to have its rightful place in our education system, along with other languages.ldquoIf students dont get to study Irish, few will end up going to spend time on residential courses in the Gaeltacht, such as those organised by Gael Linn. These courses represent an important rite of passage for thousands of students each summer. However, they rely on students studying Irish at GCSE and A Level to remain viable.ldquoThe Foyle Learning Community has, apparently, failed children who wanted to study A Level Irish because authorities in the area have not been allowing for the rightful signicance of the Irish language in the lives of many pupils in that area and in other areas also. They must have overlooked the signicant cohort of Gaelscoil pupils who would naturally wish to take Irish at GCSE and A Level.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein reiterated that Irish was more than a school subject. He said it should be made available.ldquoNothing short of maximum availability will suffice when it comes to the Irish language, our native language, he said. ldquoWe are all aware of the importance of lelong learning and there should be pathways to GCSE, A Level, diploma, degree and postgraduate study for adults and young people who wish to continue learning Irish while working or after leaving post-primary education. There should be incentives for institutions to offer Irish in this way.ldquoIrish, as a taught subject, is in danger of being available to fewer and fewer students as time progresses. This stems from the disapplication of the requirement to take a language at GCSE taken by the Government in Westminster in , coupled with the excessive emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathssubjects.ldquoIt began to impact in , at the same time as the economic crisis, followed by Brexit confusion and, more recently, Covid-. The crisis in Irish language learning cannot be allowed to deteriorate further. It is too important to us all, even though we dont all realise this as much as we should.ldquoIf this situation continues, fewer students will continue to study Irish at university and this despite the increased demand for Irish in the workplace across the island.

Stephen Jones, who works for Climate Northern Ireland, will be among  delegates from  countries taking part in a six-week online policy and leadership programme and will gain exclusive access to policy experts and training, discuss policy ideas with UK Parliamentarians and Government and be mentored by UK think tanks and other senior leaders. googletag.cmd.push In partnership with the prestigious Moslashller Institute at Cambridge University, Future Leaders Connect aims to help delegates develop their skills, expand their networks and ultimately, make policy change. Stephen , who originally went toLimavadyGrammar School, was selected from over , applicants worldwide and as part of the process, had to pitch his global policy vision – choosing to focus on climate action. He has over seven years experience co-ordinating climate change adaptation in Northern Ireland, holds an MSc from Queens University Belfast and has experience as a Red Cross Volunteer on the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. Speaking ahead of the programme, he said: “I applied to Future Leaders Connect to educate myself on how to make the biggest impact with good policy. This is especially important in the s, at a time when the stakes of making good decisions are higher than ever before. I also wanted to bring my own experience of supporting organisations to plan for climate impacts, to work with folks from around the world, and to raise the profile of climate resilience. “Following the programme,I plan to raise the issue of climate impacts up the agenda this year and I will be running a session at the COP summit in Glasgow in November to do just that.     It is also important that we get good climate change legislation in Northern Ireland, as we are the last place in the UK and Ireland to get it, so I hope to be able to better engage with this process.” Speaking further about his policy vision he said: “Evenwe stop all greenhouse gasemissions today, we have locked in changes to the climate system. These changes mean that natural weather extremes like flooding, heat and storms are becoming more intense and frequent, and on a huge scale. The means we require immediate action, so my policy vision is for resilience to climate change impacts to be given equal footing to cutting greenhouse gases. We have to do these two actions together. “This is not currently the case in Northern Ireland, or anywhere . I have been working on this professionally for more than seven years in Northern Ireland, but this is a global issue which is underdeveloped and needs support. It will be those least able to deal with the impacts who are at most risk.” For this Centenary year, the programme has been expanded in Northern Ireland to ten places instead of the usual two, through the support of the Northern Ireland Office, with Stephen joined on the programme by nine other delegates from Northern Ireland. Stephen Jones Across the six weeks they will connect with emerging leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Ukraine, Vietnam and the rest of the UK. Congratulating Stephen and the nine other Northern Ireland participants, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis,said:“I’m proud that the Northern Ireland Office is supporting the expansion of the programmethis Centenary year, meaning more young people from Northern Ireland will be taking part. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for them to hear from leaders around the world and learn how governments can work together to tackle the great global issues of the day. Also speaking about the programme,Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Irelandsaid: “We’re delighted to be able to announce the ten exceptional iniduals from Northern Ireland taking part in this year’s global programme. Future Leaders Connect is an opportunity for emerging leaders in Northern Ireland to collaborate with their counterparts from all over the world, and to benefit from the sharing of ideas and knowledge in tackling global issues and challenges. “The application process was extremely competitive, and we are certain that our ten young leaders whose backgrounds range from law and politics to housing and the environment, will make positive changes in Northern Ireland. We wish them every success in the programme.” This year’s Future Leaders Connect programme officially kicked off yesterdayand will run for six weeks online until November .

Stephen Jones, who works for Climate Northern Ireland, will be among  delegates from  countries taking part in a six-week online policy and leadership programme and will gain exclusive access to policy experts and training, discuss policy ideas with UK Parliamentarians and Government and be mentored by UK think tanks and other senior leaders. googletag.cmd.push In partnership with the prestigious Moslashller Institute at Cambridge University, Future Leaders Connect aims to help delegates develop their skills, expand their networks and ultimately, make policy change. Stephen , who originally went toLimavadyGrammar School, was selected from over , applicants worldwide and as part of the process, had to pitch his global policy vision – choosing to focus on climate action. He has over seven years experience co-ordinating climate change adaptation in Northern Ireland, holds an MSc from Queens University Belfast and has experience as a Red Cross Volunteer on the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. Speaking ahead of the programme, he said: “I applied to Future Leaders Connect to educate myself on how to make the biggest impact with good policy. This is especially important in the s, at a time when the stakes of making good decisions are higher than ever before. I also wanted to bring my own experience of supporting organisations to plan for climate impacts, to work with folks from around the world, and to raise the profile of climate resilience. “Following the programme,I plan to raise the issue of climate impacts up the agenda this year and I will be running a session at the COP summit in Glasgow in November to do just that.     It is also important that we get good climate change legislation in Northern Ireland, as we are the last place in the UK and Ireland to get it, so I hope to be able to better engage with this process.” Speaking further about his policy vision he said: “Evenwe stop all greenhouse gasemissions today, we have locked in changes to the climate system. These changes mean that natural weather extremes like flooding, heat and storms are becoming more intense and frequent, and on a huge scale. The means we require immediate action, so my policy vision is for resilience to climate change impacts to be given equal footing to cutting greenhouse gases. We have to do these two actions together. “This is not currently the case in Northern Ireland, or anywhere . I have been working on this professionally for more than seven years in Northern Ireland, but this is a global issue which is underdeveloped and needs support. It will be those least able to deal with the impacts who are at most risk.” For this Centenary year, the programme has been expanded in Northern Ireland to ten places instead of the usual two, through the support of the Northern Ireland Office, with Stephen joined on the programme by nine other delegates from Northern Ireland. Stephen Jones Across the six weeks they will connect with emerging leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Ukraine, Vietnam and the rest of the UK. Congratulating Stephen and the nine other Northern Ireland participants, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis,said:“I’m proud that the Northern Ireland Office is supporting the expansion of the programmethis Centenary year, meaning more young people from Northern Ireland will be taking part. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for them to hear from leaders around the world and learn how governments can work together to tackle the great global issues of the day. Also speaking about the programme,Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Irelandsaid: “We’re delighted to be able to announce the ten exceptional iniduals from Northern Ireland taking part in this year’s global programme. Future Leaders Connect is an opportunity for emerging leaders in Northern Ireland to collaborate with their counterparts from all over the world, and to benefit from the sharing of ideas and knowledge in tackling global issues and challenges. “The application process was extremely competitive, and we are certain that our ten young leaders whose backgrounds range from law and politics to housing and the environment, will make positive changes in Northern Ireland. We wish them every success in the programme.” This year’s Future Leaders Connect programme officially kicked off yesterdayand will run for six weeks online until November .

Monny McSorleywas just  years old when she passed away in April , after suffering a heart attack. The grandmother was just weeks away from her th birthday. googletag.cmd.push Last month her four daughters Ciara, Carla, Aileen and Erin and husband Eamon organised a  hour walk at Watty Graham GAC. The walk, which saw each of the girls clock , steps each, raised pound, for BHF NI research. Monny’s daughter Carla said: “We have been blown away by people’s kindness. The people inMagheraand at Watty Graham’s GAC really went above and beyond in supporting the event and supporting us. We will be forever in each of your debt and you have our sincere thanks. Special thanks to Watty Grahams GAC for all their help in making the walk a possibility. Thanks also to the support of local businesses Bitz and Pizza and Crawfords for providing refreshments and Tommie McGraths and Christie Print for their help with t-shirts and banners. “Thank you so much to every single person who joined us on the walk. Any time we even thought about having a rest, more people would come along and walk with us sharing memories of mammy and taking our minds off our sore feet. .     “We each had dferent moments when it got really tough, but luckily we had each other to provide encouragement and see us through the challenging parts. There were definitely some blisters and sore feet the day after, but it was all worth it for mammy.” Having lost their mum during the pandemic, this walk was very special for everyone who knew Monny. Carla said the walk provided them with a chance to connect with those who had been unable to attend her mothers funeral or wake due to the lockdown. “Mammy died when we had just entered our first strict lockdown here, so we weren’t able to have a normal wake or funeral, she said. The -hour walk gave us the chance to see those people who would have come along to the wake and funeral during normal times. It was unbelievable the amount of people who showed up to walk with us and donate to BHF NI,” she added. Monny was known and loved throughout her local community for her charity volunteering and fundraising work, as well as working closely with children with special educational needs. Monny McSorley Head of BHF NI, Fearghal McKinney said: “The staggering amount raised is a testament to the woman who Monny was, so well respected and loved in her community. With an initial target of just pound,, they really outdid themselves, raising pound, more than what they had initially aimed for. “We are extremely grateful for the support which the McSorley family and theMagheracommunity have given BHF NI. Choosing to support future heart research and indeed other people affected by heart disease through their event was an incredibly thoughtful thing for them to do, especially in the wake of losing someone so close to them. “We couldn’t fund our le-saving heart and circulatory disease research without the support of families like Monny’s. When the BHF was formed seven out of  people died from a heart attack but thanks to the power of research now seven out of  people survive. But sadly, like Monny’s story shows, that is still too many people dying far too soon and leaving behind a devastated family.

Monny McSorleywas just  years old when she passed away in April , after suffering a heart attack. The grandmother was just weeks away from her th birthday. googletag.cmd.push Last month her four daughters Ciara, Carla, Aileen and Erin and husband Eamon organised a  hour walk at Watty Graham GAC. The walk, which saw each of the girls clock , steps each, raised pound, for BHF NI research. Monny’s daughter Carla said: “We have been blown away by people’s kindness. The people inMagheraand at Watty Graham’s GAC really went above and beyond in supporting the event and supporting us. We will be forever in each of your debt and you have our sincere thanks. Special thanks to Watty Grahams GAC for all their help in making the walk a possibility. Thanks also to the support of local businesses Bitz and Pizza and Crawfords for providing refreshments and Tommie McGraths and Christie Print for their help with t-shirts and banners. “Thank you so much to every single person who joined us on the walk. Any time we even thought about having a rest, more people would come along and walk with us sharing memories of mammy and taking our minds off our sore feet. .     “We each had dferent moments when it got really tough, but luckily we had each other to provide encouragement and see us through the challenging parts. There were definitely some blisters and sore feet the day after, but it was all worth it for mammy.” Having lost their mum during the pandemic, this walk was very special for everyone who knew Monny. Carla said the walk provided them with a chance to connect with those who had been unable to attend her mothers funeral or wake due to the lockdown. “Mammy died when we had just entered our first strict lockdown here, so we weren’t able to have a normal wake or funeral, she said. The -hour walk gave us the chance to see those people who would have come along to the wake and funeral during normal times. It was unbelievable the amount of people who showed up to walk with us and donate to BHF NI,” she added. Monny was known and loved throughout her local community for her charity volunteering and fundraising work, as well as working closely with children with special educational needs. Monny McSorley Head of BHF NI, Fearghal McKinney said: “The staggering amount raised is a testament to the woman who Monny was, so well respected and loved in her community. With an initial target of just pound,, they really outdid themselves, raising pound, more than what they had initially aimed for. “We are extremely grateful for the support which the McSorley family and theMagheracommunity have given BHF NI. Choosing to support future heart research and indeed other people affected by heart disease through their event was an incredibly thoughtful thing for them to do, especially in the wake of losing someone so close to them. “We couldn’t fund our le-saving heart and circulatory disease research without the support of families like Monny’s. When the BHF was formed seven out of  people died from a heart attack but thanks to the power of research now seven out of  people survive. But sadly, like Monny’s story shows, that is still too many people dying far too soon and leaving behind a devastated family. We urgently need to fund more research to save other families from this heartbreak.”  Over , new homes required in Mid Ulster by   A recent report on housing was published by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive .

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted earlier this year to hand control of Portstewart Town Hall back to its original owners - the Montagu Estate - after receiving Notice to Quit in . googletag.cmd.push Portstewart Community Associationhad called on the Department for Communities to intervene in the handover after a Public Records Office for Northern Irelanddocument appeared to cast doubt on the halls ownership arrangements. Under Section  of the Local Government Act, district councils must seek Ministerial approval for any disposal of land that is not at the best price or for the best rent. Department for Communities guidance says Section  also forms the basis for district councils to provide justication for a project and that the disposal is for the well-being of the district. However, a spokesperson for the Council said it does not consider Section  relevant on this occasion. Throughout Council’s long consideration of this matter legal advice confirmed that Council holds no title deeds for the building. The Montague Estate holds title, they said. Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted earlier this year to hand control of Portstewart Town Hall back to its original owners - the Montagu Estate - after receiving Notice to Quit in . googletag.cmd.push Portstewart Community Associationhad called on the Department for Communities to intervene in the handover after a Public Records Office for Northern Irelanddocument appeared to cast doubt on the halls ownership arrangements. Under Section  of the Local Government Act, district councils must seek Ministerial approval for any disposal of land that is not at the best price or for the best rent. Department for Communities guidance says Section  also forms the basis for district councils to provide justication for a project and that the disposal is for the well-being of the district. However, a spokesperson for the Council said it does not consider Section  relevant on this occasion. Throughout Council’s long consideration of this matter legal advice confirmed that Council holds no title deeds for the building. The Montague Estate holds title, they said. Council’s Legal Team advised Council that the land in question is not registered in the Land Registry. Registry of Deeds searcheswere carried outfrom the s to present andhave no entries relating to the purchase of the Town Hall with a freehold title from the Montague Estate, . Council is aware of the PRONI document, but legal advice obtained and presented to Council advised that PRONI records are not proof of title and are only useful at providing general information.     It is possible any purchase price mentionedmay relate to a premium under a long lease. PRONI records also show Montague involvement with the Town Hall into the s. Council holds no title to the land and therefore Council does not consider Section  relevant as no transfer of land has taken place. The possibility of a community asset transfer to the people of Portstewart can only proceed with the agreement of the legal owner of the building, the Montague Estate. The community is free to engage with the Montague Estate regarding this matter. Last week, the Montagu Estate said they were disappointed years of neglect had resulted in the closure of the Town Hall. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all, they said in a statement released by their solicitor.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Paul Lavilleand James Donaghy, MD of Donaghy Bros, at the awards.Local NewsCounty Derry electrical retailer collects top award in London overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMickey left memories that will be cherished forever overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Seamus Crossan ran  miles in  hours to raise poundk for Belmont CottagesDerry NewsDerry man runs  miles in  hours to raise poundk for wheelchair accessible vehicle for Belmont Cottages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Damian Brown pictured with his father Sean Brown during his playing days with Bellaghy.Local NewsTributes paid to gentleman Damian overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, has accused the DUP of setting themselves on a destructive course of action designed to antagonise nationalistsLocal NewsEastwood: Unionist threat of blocking Nationalist First Minister is insulting and pathetic overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates. The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school. Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others. I hope that this vision can be realised..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_conor.jpg","title":"Conor shines in final  ","story":"DROMARA travelled to Ballykinlar to take on a fancied Drumaness side in the county U- Football Shield final last Sunday evening.The game started well for Drumaness with two quick points on the board from Niall Flanagan and Ben Cassidy in the first few minutes, but soon Dromara were awarded a penalty after Thomas McKey was fouled in the box.Thomas took the penalty himself, but it was well saved by lsquokeeper Reece Rogan.Dromara did get on the scoresheet after a foul on Odhraacuten McCann was converted by Jon Rodgers.Both defences dictated play over the next period with Dromararsquos Elliot Harris, Sam Warwick and James Furphy keeping the mobile Drumaness forwards at bay.Dromararsquos fortunes took a hit when forward Odhraacuten McCann suffered a nasty shoulder injury and had to be replaced.Just before the water-break, Drumaness rattled off two excellent long range scores from Conor Armstrong with Dromara replying with an equally great score from Joe McAllister.Dromara were finding the physicality of the Drumaness full back line of Leo Madine, Ben Miskelly and Philip Gladysz dficult to penetrate.Drumaness finished the quarter with a point from Conor Murphy leaving them ahead by three points.The second quarter started off with another cracking point from Conor Armstrong and within minutes Drumaness took control of the game.Shea Quinn got on the end of a long ball and bagged a goal and a minute later Conor Armstrong hit a second goal.Dromara rallied with good points from Thomas McKey and Jon Rodgers but once again Drumaness replied with a point from a free from Conor Murphy and two further points from the unstoppable Conor Armstrong.Drumaness half backs Jaiden Murdock and Conn OrsquoHagan were delivering quality balls to their forwards and Dromararsquos half backs Aidan OrsquoHare and Ryan Gates had to work very hard to stem the relentless attacks.Young Lorcan McNeill scored a great inidual goal to offer Dromara some hope, but, as ever, the Blues hit straight back with scores from Jake Madine and another from Conor Armstrong.The half ended with a fine point for Dromara from the energetic Joe McAllister to leave Drumaness leading by nine points. Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks. Congratulations to the Drumaness team and their mentors on a great display and a deserved victory.Dromara -Drumaness -U- Shield Final.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_cormac.jpg","title":"Cormac enjoy his first days at Harvard University  ","story":"CORMAC Savage was only  when he got his first experience of the hallowed halls of Hard University.Standing in the same place where former president John F Kennedy once walked was enough to confirm to the young teenager that this is where he had to be one day.Just four years later, the Downpatrick man has fulfilled his dream and is studying at the world-renowned Ivy League university in the US.The former head boy of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School has jumped right in and immersed himself into his classes and every extra-curricular activity and group he can possibly join.He has been in the city of Cambridge, on the fringe of Boston, since late August.Despite getting four A* grades in his A-Levels and having achieved considerable praise for his roles in school politics and as a Youth Parliament Member for South Down, he said he was overwhelmed to have been accepted into Hard late last year.ldquoEvery single day I think Irsquom so lucky to be here. I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland. My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

mdash A major new drive has been launched to attract private investment in a planned multi-million pound facelt for Newcastle.Down Council is targeting a host of major private firms in a bid to interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what le is like in a community with nothing.From a world that is void of any luxuries and running short on basic necessities, African visitors from Malawi, brought their gt of song to St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a plane, boat or train before and how they only earn around pound a year.School principal, Mr Harry Murray, said he was delighted to have the visitors at the school so his students could hear for themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will signicantly raise the profile of Killyleagh as a tourist destination and add support to existing town facilities such as shops, entertainment, recreational facilities, schools and churches.SAINTFIELD

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13099826.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Jonathan Porter PresseyeThis would mean it would be entitled to nominate for the First Minister post for the first time, with the deputy First Minister role going to the largest unionist party.Both the First and deputy First Minister posts have equal powers and one cannot be in office without the other.The DUP’s Paul Givan currently holds the First Minister post and Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill is deputy First Minister.But unionist parties have refused to confirm whether they would support an Executive which has a Sinn Fein First Minister.Mr Beattie was asked for clarity during an appearance on the BBC.He said: “We are seven months from an election. I have no idea what the environment is going to be seven months from now.“The Ulster Unionist Party will be going into the election to be the largest party in Northern Ireland. We are aiming to be the First Minister.”Asked againhe would take part in an Executive with a Sinn Fein First Minister, Mr Beattie said: “I am not telling people what my tactics are going to be seven months out from an election.“Everything is tactics. The number of candidates I am going to run is tactics, everything that we put in our manesto will outline where we are going to be. We are playing for number one.”DUP MP Mr Wilson was asked the same question.He said: “As far as we are concerned, we will be going to the electorate at the forthcoming election, whenever that happens to be, asking the people of Northern Ireland to ensure that those who wrecked our country for  years, those who want to tear our country out of the United Kingdom and those who can’t even show any respect to unionist traditions, that they should not become the biggest party in the representation of Northern Ireland.“I don’t answer hypothetical questions.”But Sinn Fein’s junior minister in the Executive, Declan Kearney, said Northern Ireland cannot go back to “majoritarianism”.“It sounds very clearly that Sammy Wilson is advancing a rejectionist agenda of powersharing,” he said.“Sinn Fein will continue to represent all citizens in this society, regardless of their background.

The firm has been a successful firm for the last  years but, like many firms in the building industry, struggled during the COVID- pandemic.A family business, it was a major employer in the Co Armagh, Down and Antrim areas and had a fleet of around  company vehicles covering all areas of NI. Their services included mechanical, electrical, planned works, response maintenance, disabled adaptations and refurbishment of homes and offices.According to its website, its clients include the South Ulster Housing Association, Connswater Homes, NB Housing Abbeyfield, Clanmil Housing Group and Rural Housing Association.It is understood the workforce were told they would not be paid for last week’s work but would be entitled to claim for a government redundancy payment.Statement from the NI Housing ExecutiveA Housing Executive said: “We are sorry to hear that one of our contractors, JMC Ltd, has announced that it is entering liquidation.“The company was the repairs contractor for our tenants in the Lisburn and Castlereagh area and was also the contractor for a number of improvement schemes across Lisburn and Castlereagh and the Belfast area.“Our priority at this stage is to ensure minimal disruption to services for tenants and those planned maintenance improvement works which are on site.”Statement from North Belfast HousingNB Housingsaid on Twitter last night: “It is with much regret that our main contractor JMC have ceased trading with immediate effect. “This will have an immediate impact on our ability to provide our usual repair service. “We are working to ensure emergency arrangements can be made and we will provide an update asap.”What the politicians saidUpper Bann MP Carla Lockhart said: “This is devastating news and deeply troubling for the employees losing their jobs, and their families.“This is a long standing, well established and respected company that has obviously suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic. “I will be reaching out to management to seeanything can be done. I will also be working with the Economy Minister to see what support can be out in place to help those losing their livelihoods to find new jobs.” Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd said the closure of JMC construction company will be a huge blow for its workers and their families.Mr O’Dowd said: “The closure will see over  workers losing their jobs through no fault of their own.“Those workers have rights and entitlements which must be honoured and their wages and redundancies must be paid.“I will be engaging with all the relevant authorities to ensure those workers who have lost their jobs receive the monies owed to them and their families.”SDLP Upper Bann MLA Dolores Kelly said her thoughts are with staff after the closure of JMC Mechanical and Construction.The Upper Bann MLA said: “The news that JMC Mechanical and Construction has entered liquidation will come as a huge shock and blow to the company’s staff, with up to  jobs lost as a result of this announcement. My thoughts are with them and their families at this dficult time. I am heartened to hear that a number of employees have already secured jobs and hope the rest will soon, especially at a time when skilled tradespeople are in such high demand.“My office is open for those affected and we will offer any help and support we can and I’ll also be raising this situation with the Economy Minister to seethere are any steps he can take to help those involved.“The loss of over  jobs will be devastating to people across Armagh, Down and Antrim where this company operated, This is the latest in a long line of mass job losses we have experienced and we need to see action from the Executive to protect jobs and encourage investment in these areas to regenerate employment.”Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie said: “The news of JMC contracts entering liquidation is a massive blow for staff and their families. My thoughts are with those who have now lost their jobs, in what is already a dficult time for many financially.“JMC has been operating for over  years and it is devastating to see them suffer due as a result of the pandemic.“I believe some local companies have come forward to offer jobs to some of those  workers, this will be good news for some, but others will still be left in limbo and we need to make sure they receive the support needed.“This of course has a knock-on effect for housing associations who will now have to find new contractors and I would ask those who need repairs to please be patient while these associations work to ensure those emergency repairs can be made.”Claims of rise in ‘gang culture’ in Portadown after child threatened with macheteEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

His first film “Before my Time”was nominated at the Learning on Screen Awards in London. Paul has directed internationally, notably winning best doc at the Peace On Earth Film Festival. In his spare time Paul enjoyed fishing and playing music.Paul was a key figure in founding a TV studio at Lurgan Junior High before moving into social enterprise LJHSTV.In  he spent five days in Washington DC after being specially invited to attend the President’s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge conference - a testament to the impact his films have had on an international scale.At that stage he was the Creative Director of LJHSTV and was asked to showcase his film, ‘Ticking the Box ’ at the conference and it was warmly received by an eclectic mix of viewers.Among the vast collection of global influencers, Paul even got a glimpse of the US President as Barrack Obama addressed the conference via video link.The purpose of the conference was to bring together faith and education leaders from across the globe, and Paul seized the opportunity to exchange ideas and ambitions with his international counterparts.“There was a German professor there who absolutely loved the film,” Paul said at the time, “and he waxed lyrical about it! It went down really well.”He also received an invitation to Kosovo to film - focusing on inter-faith issues.This was not be the first time Paul had established connections in distant lands. Several friends travelled down from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to attend the film screening at the conference and sat on a  to answer questions and spark a debate after the film was shown.Paul and his small team - consisting of Thomas Glass, his fellow company director, and Paul’s we, Marina - have been singled out again and again for being creators of a unique style of filmmaking. Their approach is one fuelled by curiosity: always questioning and approaching issues from an alternative perspective.LJHSTV were no strangers to making waves on both sides of the Atlantic, with their first film having a big impact on home soil - setting out to question the absence of The Troubles in children’s education here.The film ‘Before My Time’ acted as a catalyst to thinking about changes in the history curriculum.It started when Marina took students to Harrisburg for Martin Luther King Day. When they ed, they decided to make a film - not about racism, but about sectarianism. It was championed by one of the history inspectors, and was shown to history teachers across the country.Building his projects around the areas of education and community engagement, Paul was a great believer in the capabilities and talents of young people - shaped by his time as teacher at Lurgan Junior High School.Paul’s we, Marina, works as a teacher in Lurgan, and usually conducts interviews on the films he and Thomas made.Lurgan Junior High paid tribute to Paul on its Facebook page: “The Principal, Governors and staff or Lurgan Junior High School deeply regret the passing of Paul Moorhead, former teacher at our school, and husband of our esteemed colleague Mrs Moorhead, and extend to her and the family our deepest sympathy at this sad time.”Read this:- Construction firm in liquidationEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
