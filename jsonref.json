But a few — such as Paula — won’t.Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre, says Paula is far from alone in suffering from ‘sleep inertia — a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’.‘There could be a number of causes, from an underlying disorder, such as sleep apnoea, or problems with sleep quality so that the brain feels it needs to stay asleep to get a sufficient amount,’ says Dr Ebrahim.‘Otherwise, it might be down to a circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase — which usually happens in the first two to three hours of the night — at the wrong part of the sleep cycle.’Paula did seek help from her GP a couple of years ago, after sleeping through a day’s work when Mark was not around to wake her, and after blood tests came back normal, was given a clean bill of health.Since then, she’s tried everything from going to bed early, to exercising in the evening, meditating, using a sun lamp and even leaving the curtains open. Nothing works.         She finds it hard to accept the severe fatigue syndrome syndrome because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the worldMost evenings, she turns in at around 10pm and has to be physically dragged from sleep ten hours later, at 8am, often after music producer Mark, 41, has spent more than an hour trying to wake her.Paula has had problems waking for as long as she can remember. Her mother says that, even as a baby and toddler, she could ‘sleep round the clock’ and it was always a huge problem getting her up for school in the mornings.Although her loved ones try to be understanding, her nocturnal habits have been a source of great tension over the years.Six years ago, Paula had enjoyed a night out with her sister, Petra, who was staying with her, and a group of friends. Towards the end of the evening, Paula — who hadn’t been drinking — was ready to go home, while Petra wanted to stay a little later. So Paula caught a taxi home, fully expecting to still be awake by the time her sister returned, so she could let her in.When Petra got back, however, Paula was already fast asleep and, despite banging on the door, until a neighbour threatened to ring the police, and calling her mobile 50 times, Petra could not rouse her.‘There were no hotels nearby, so my poor sister ended up spending the night in a photobooth at a nearby train station,’ says Paula, still shamefaced at the memory. ‘It was January and by the time I opened the door to her the following day she was like a drowned rat and frozen to the bone.‘She was so angry she slapped me across the face and didn’t speak to me for weeks. In fact, it’s still a bone of contention between us as she can’t understand how anyone could sleep through all that.’         Paula Stewart, 38, is \u0027entirely reliant on my partner to physically wake me, otherwise I would, quite literally, sleep all day\u0027. As a student, she managed to sleep through an alarm and evacuation of her residencePaula has also left her business partner, Layla, in the lurch by sleeping the day away, instead of turning up for meetings she has arranged at their offices.‘Layla has always been understanding, up to a point,’ says Paula. ‘But it’s so embarrassing having to admit that the reason I’ve let people down is because I can’t do that most basic thing that others seem to find so easy and wake up in the mornings.’Left to her own devices, she can sleep for an unbroken 36 hours, although she says she never wakes feeling refreshed.One weekend last year when Mark was away, she slept through the whole of Saturday — going to bed at 11.30pm on Friday night and not waking until 9.30am on Sunday. She was shocked to discover she’d lost a day when she came to.She felt dehydrated, and needed the loo, but neither of those discomforts had disturbed her enough to wake her.Paula has always assumed she was alone with her sleep problems, but it turns out there are others like her.Mother-of-two Liz Dowse, 38, from Chelmsford, Essex, says chronically heavy sleeping has dogged her entire life. Even as a toddler she would sleep until midday.Every night she sets 15 alarms on her mobile phone, which she keeps right beside her bed, then sleeps through each one in turn.It is only because husband, Matt, 42, a manager for a dry-cleaning machinery firm, repeatedly shouts at her until she’s physically up and standing by the bed, that she manages to function, and embrace the day at all. The whole process can take up to an hour. ‘Thankfully Matt is understanding of what we refer to as my “condition”.         ‘Other people may think I’m just idle, but when I fall asleep it’s honestly like I go into an unconscious state and, when I finally wake up, I’m in a sheer panic, with no idea what day or time it is.’Unsurprisingly, it fell to Matt to wake his wife to feed their children — Teddy, 13, and Francesca, eight — when they were babies.There have been embarrassing episodes when she’s been away from home, too. One night, Liz — who hardly ever drinks alcohol, in case it exacerbates her sleep problems, and is not on any medication — was working away and staying in a hotel where the fire alarm went off.While every other guest came to — it’s hard to imagine how anyone wouldn’t, given that it was also accompanied by the bedside phone ringing and ceiling lights flashing — and evacuated the hotel, Liz was totally oblivious.‘I finally woke to find several firefighters around my bed,’ she recalls. ‘It was so humiliating. I could see from all the missed calls that my boss at the time, who was also staying at the hotel, had been repeatedly calling my mobile.’Liz, a size 6 to 8, has had various blood tests and health checks to rule out such things as an underactive thyroid or anaemia, which could make her tired and has been told by one doctor that she has ‘severe fatigue syndrome’.Having Googled it and only been able to find ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ — a condition said to render sufferers exhausted the whole time — she finds it hard to accept that as a possible diagnosis because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the world.Dr Neil Stanley, resident expert for Sleepstation, an online programme to tackle insomnia, has another theory. When we sleep, we go through various cycles of deep and lighter sleep.While most people are difficult to wake during their deep sleep phase, when the body and brainwaves slow down, these normally occur in the middle of the night, and few experience it so close to the end of a cycle.         There is an increasing number of women who suffer sleep (stock image) inertia - \u0027a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’, according to Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre‘So it may be that these women are not in deep sleep but in dreaming sleep and the signal from their alarm is not sufficiently intrusive to wake them, because they might just incorporate that noise into their dream,’ says Dr Stanley.Lynette Morse, 38, from Glasgow, who has missed foreign holidays and family funerals — as well as sleeping through an earthquake — feels she has tried everything in her power to be able to get out of bed in the mornings.Having been to her GP numerous times about her problem, to no avail, kept diaries of everything she does and eats, changed her routines, including the times she goes to bed and aims to get up, she is wholly reliant on partner of eight years. Cameron, a careers adviser, to wake her.He sets an alarm for ten minutes earlier than he needs to get up and dedicates that time to waking Lynette. ‘I’ve had alarms on my mobile phone, ones that vibrate and radio alarms, but none of them wake me,’ says Lynette who, like Paula and Liz, rarely drinks alcohol and is not on any medication. ‘I need someone repeatedly calling my name, and taking the covers off me, until I eventually come to.         Problems with sleeping (file image) mean an inidual\u0027s brain might feel it needs to stay asleep for a sufficient amount or they could suffer an underlying condition such as sleep apnoea, Dr Irshaad Ebrahim added. Circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase usually happens in the first couple of hours ‘Cameron puts music on, continues shouting my name and then lets our cat in, who’s big and climbs on top of me and starts pawing at my face, so it’s a mixture of these things that finally means I can put my feet on the floor.‘I think Cameron thought I was exaggerating the extent of my problem at first and, maybe in the first couple of months he got frustrated, but now he accepts that I cannot wake up without his help. I’m hugely grateful to him but being so totally reliant on someone else makes me anxious. I often think: “What would happen if he became ill in the night? How long would it be before I was aware?”.‘I’m always Googling to see if there’s some new pill or technology to help people like me and I once joined an online group for heavy sleepers, but got frustrated and left because no one had any solutions.’Like Paula, Lynette, who runs a web-based business from home, selling baby clothes, told Cameron early in their relationship that she didn’t want children, partly because of her ‘sleep problem’ which she says would make motherhood ‘very challenging indeed’.When she was living alone, Lynette missed a family holiday to Tenerife, waking three hours after the flight had taken off, despite countless calls to her mobile from her frantic parents at the airport.When her cousin died, Lynette was ‘utterly mortified’ to sleep through the 11am funeral. She was also horrified when a neighbour told her that she’d caught a would-be burglar trying to kick in her front door the previous night — Lynette had slept through it.More alarming still, years ago when on holiday Lynette was dead to the world when an earthquake struck in Marmaris, Turkey, causing her hotel to rock on its foundations. Fortunately, she was with her parents who insisted the manager unlock her hotel room door so that they could wake their daughter during the evacuation.\u0027It’s gone down in family folklore that not even an earthquake, measuring a terrifying 5.6 on the Richter scale, can wake me.’So next time you’re tossing and turning in the middle of the night, cursing the fact you can’t get back to sleep, spare a thought for the super slumberers — who’d give anything to be able to wake up. "},{"url":null,"title":"Heavier new cars pump CO2 older models","story":"Share this article Mid-size petrol SUVs, which covers vehicles of the size of the Nissan Qashqai, rose by 20.4 per cent – up from 157.6gkm to 189.8g.The worst-performing group were the large petrol-hybrid cars, which are the size of the BMW 3 Series.

Shelton has cast doubt on the desirability of, and legal basis for, Fed independence, saying last year, “I don’t see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the Federal Reserve.” And she has argued for “a more coordinated relationship with both Congress and the president”. If Fed policy were “coordinated” with Trump, then it is fairly clear who would be calling the shots.Of course, one new Fed governor could not upturn decades of practice. But there are suggestions that if appointed, Shelton could replace Jay Powell when his term comes up for renewal in 2022, leaving a fox in charge of the chicken coop.It is not only in the US that central-bank independence is under threat. In Turkey, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, fired his governor last year, saying that “we told him several times to cut interest rates” but he did not oblige. In India, the government asked the Reserve Bank to hand over some of its reserves and the governor, Urjit Patel, resigned “for personal reasons” and his key deputy followed soon after with a broadside directed at the prime minister Narendra Modi’s administration: “Governments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of the financial markets.”Are these prophets of doom correct? Will we soon see control of interest rates back in the self-interested hands of finance ministries? In the words of the song, was central bank independence just a silly phase we were going through?I think not. The most recent global survey, by the economists Nergiz Dincer and Barry Eichengreen, though admittedly conducted in 2014, shows that there is still a “steady movement in the direction of greater transparency and independence over time (and) little indication these trends are being rethought”. One may have some grounds for scepticism about the measures of independence they use – according to their model, Kyrgyzstan boasts the world’s most independent central bank – but they can find no cases where changes to legislation bringing the central bank back under political control have been implemented.In the west, while Trump has huffed and puffed, he appointed Powell, a man with conventional instincts and a backbone. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, resisted the temptation to appoint a Brexit supporter to the Bank of England and named a veteran BoE insider, Andrew Bailey, who has independence in his bones. In the eurozone, a similarly neutral choice emerged as Draghi’s successor and a change in the ECB’s status would require a new EU treaty. The chances of that are vanishingly small. EU leaders show no indication of taking the risk of opening up the constitution to further referendums, as would be necessary in some countries. Furthermore, some of the political pressure for action has diminished. Trust in the ECB fell sharply after the eurozone crisis almost a decade ago but has recovered in most countries in the last couple of years. Even in Greece, the ECB is trusted more than the national government.There has, it is true, been a change in political rhetoric. After a long period in which governments resisted any commentary on interest-rate decisions, some have become more vocal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative who is the leader of the House of Commons, dubbed Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, a “second-tier Canadian politician” who failed to get a job at home, after Carney disagreed with Rees-Mogg’s economic judgment on the costs of Brexit. And Trump has characteristically weighed in with tweeted criticism of the Fed.Should central banks regard this renewed disputatiousness as a bad and dangerous thing? They may, if they wish, but I suspect they are pushing water uphill. We have moved into a less respectful age, which is not surprising, given the mistakes made by central banks (and others) in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Instead of bemoaning the surge of comment and challenge, central banks need to raise their game, enhance their transparency and get better at explaining and justifying their actions and decisions.• Sir Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, is chairman of RBS.

What did it mean when Princess Diana was killed escaping voracious photographers? At the time the Daily Mail said it would never again use paparazzi that didn’t last long. Nor does the occasional spasm of sham remorse following the latest media outrage.This week Danielle Hindley finally won compensation from the Mail on Sunday and its owners, Associated Newspapers, for life-wrecking lies about her. You may not have heard of her, but she’s one of the ordinary people casually mauled by the press. Hindley is a beautician with a small salon in a village outside Leeds. In 2017, the Mail on Sunday sent an undercover reporter whose story made out she was a “cosmetic cowboy” and “rogue beautician”, suggesting she was unqualified and had left a client damaged.It wasn’t true, but it destroyed her reputation, her mental health and her son’s life at school. The story propelled itself around social media, leaving footprints everywhere. Settling the case this week, the Mail on Sunday admitted, “There was no truth in the very grave allegations”, and that she was amply qualified to practise.Before resorting to the courts, Hindley complained to the press regulator, Ipso, the old Press Complaints Commission rebranded in 2014 after the hacking scandal, owned and funded by the big newspaper groups. Paul Dacre, then editor of the Daily Mail, helped to draft its code. It found in Hindley’s favour: the paper had “given a significantly misleading impression of the complainant’s conduct because it suggested she was guilty of wrongdoing”. A correction was required on page 2, but when it was due the Mail on Sunday was allowed to tuck it away on page 8.Not a penny of compensation was paid, and there was no investigation into the methods used by the paper. No surprise, as Ipso has never fined a newspaper, though it boasts of its power to impose fines of up to £1m. On its launch, it was billed as “the toughest press regulator in the western world”. Hindley couldn’t find a lawyer for a libel case until she was helped by Brian Cathcart, professor of journalism at Kingston University, champion of those unjustly mangled by the poisonous British press. He found one ready to take it forward on a no-win, no-fee basis and the crucial insurance against facing the newspaper’s costs if she lost. Libel law is designed for the wealthy. Despite Ipso finding against the paper, the Mail on Sunday dragged out this case, expecting Hindley to drop it: indeed she took a lower settlement to end it after two years.This week the Sun reported a huge. £68m loss, mostly owing to still mounting phone-hacking claims. Cathcart says only a quarter of hacking victims were famous the rest were ordinary people – victims or witnesses or relatives of people in caught up in a story. Read Hacked Off’s record of horrendous press abuse cases in its report Thrown to the Wolves. The attention on Caroline Flack was relentless, especially in the Mail and the Sun. Straight after the news of her death, the Sun deleted stories online, including one about a mocking Valentine’s Day card. The paper pivoted to blame the Crown Prosecution Service for charging her with domestic violence, telling it to “take a long look in the mirror and ask why it pursued its course of action given what they knew about her vulnerability”. Until then the paper had revelled in the allegations against her. Why its publication of a picture of a blood-soaked bed at the alleged crime scene, and other press stories were not in contempt of court would be a mystery, except that would require action from the attorney general. The government has backed off from criticism of the press, and Ipso now has an ex-Tory minister as chair.Calls for a “Caroline’s law” to protect people from press persecution miss the point: the Leveson report proposed a genuinely independent press regulator that would use its teeth. But in 2018 Matt Hancock killed off the last chance of implementing it. That didn’t earn Theresa May any favourable press: politicians licking the boots that kick them never learn that lesson. Ipso might have vindicated itself and transformed the press by imposing £1m fines and demanding embarrassing apologies as prominent as the original story. But it not only fails to protect iniduals it refuses to take cases where whole groups – Muslims, Travellers, trans people – are vilified.This week the Mail on Sunday launched Toby Young’s latest self-promoting idea, as-called Free Speech Union, to protect against such abominations as “no platforming”. Odd to choose a platform that abuses its free speech with such regularity on which to launch it. Cathcart thinks the British press is probably the worst in the western world.

The prime minister has less than a year to build a new relationship – encompassing security, defence and economic ties – with the bloc. Mr Johnson secured an exit that rested upon two deals. One was a withdrawal agreement that tied Northern Ireland to the EU. The other was a political declaration with guarantees for a level playing field on environmental and labour standards as well as state aid policies to avoid UK firms gaining unfair competitive advantage in EU markets.Mr Johnson played his part in toppling his predecessor, Theresa May, because her Brexit deal was too closely aligned with the EU. He wanted to leave because it would unleash the country’s potential by giving companies in areas from food hygiene to financial services greater leeway to deregulate. If he is right then Brexit will offer the land of milk and honey to firms as relief from their wanderings in an EU red-tape desert. So why upon leaving the EU, might Mr Johnson’s supporters wonder, did the prime minister book a return ticket to its bureaucracy?Such doubts explain why Mr Johnson is trying to hollow out the legal commitments on Northern Ireland: as the Treasury warned him, they are “highly disruptive” to the region’s economy. It also, probably, accounts for his bid on Thursday to abandon commitments about the level playing field made in the political declaration. While the declaration was not legally enforceable, words do matter. The less sincerely Mr Johnson takes non-binding pledges, the more likely the EU will think that it needs a watertight legal contract for a future partnership. In a speech earlier this month David Frost, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, made – in nationalistic terms – the case for ergence. This was necessary, he said, to produce goods “relevant to our own countryside, and to produce crops that reflect our own climate, rather than being forced to work with rules designed for growing conditions in central France”. It is depressing to find this Little Britain view of EU regulations coming from No 10.There will be a consequential loss of access to EU markets for a degree of ergence. To make up for this loss of trade Mr Frost, whose time in Brussels hardened his critical views of the place, says Britain has its eyes on the horizon of an economy where it will be able to set rules for new sectors quicker than an EU hidebound by a “fear of the future”. Mr Frost does make a concession to reality by admitting that there may be a “short-run cost” from being shut out of the EU but reverts to pure Brexitism by claiming this “will be overwhelmed rapidly by the huge gains of having your own policy regimes in certain areas”.Mr Johnson risks repeating a familiar and weary strategy. Rather than engaging with the contents and pace of the talks, it appears the prime minister would rather play to the gallery – threatening to walk away from the negotiations or pledging to never surrender fishing waters. This will run down the clock towards the next cliff edge in December, where he will face a choice between a narrow deal, opting for an economically damaging “no deal”, or extending the timeframe for talks. If the past is any guide, he will yield in the endgame to the EU but will be too busy taking a victory lap to spell out the concessions he has made. One can only hope for the country’s sake that in the year ahead reality will have a larger impact than Mr Johnson’s bluster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e117e1f33bc29b6d1020837d43eda711f6bbb81/0_131_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6639e2ad94f4809dc0dc7d0ee58b5ed","title":"coronovirus test wellbeing herd vaccination","story":"When death came to the village of Eyam, it was probably hidden inside a roll of cloth. Bubonic plague is thought to have been carried to this remote corner of Derbyshire from London back in the 1660s by infected fleas, trapped in a bale of fabric ordered to make costumes for a festival. The sickness spread fast, killing dozens of villagers and leaving many on the verge of fleeing in panic – but then something extraordinary happened.The rector of Eyam, believing it his duty to spare neighbouring towns from infection, persuaded his parishioners to take the astonishingly self-sacrificing step of sealing themselves off from the world. They would live or they would die, but nobody would leave until the sickness had burned itself out. One mother is said to have buried six of her children, yet by staying must have saved countless other women from the same fate.It’s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now. When it came to the crunch, how many of us would secretly have more in common with the local squire, who fled after the first few deaths and left his neighbours to their fate? Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren’t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good.Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else’s problem.Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word “quarantine” sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is – like the tourists now confined to a Tenerife hotel after an Italian guest tested positive – when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don’t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don’t want to risk taking 14 days off.If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it’s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke draconian emergency powers to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital.China’s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even nailing victims’ front doors shut, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won’t translate easily to European democracies.So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization’s warning that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is closing all its schools but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when briefing MPs on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn’t worth it at this stage.The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam’s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go. Airlines freezing recruitment, restaurants reporting cancellations and factories running low on parts are only the most visible signifiers of what may be to come.But when the WHO urges countries to step up preparations, it isn’t just talking about hospital beds and economic resilience and endlessly reminding people to wash their hands. This isn’t just a test of clinical resources but a test too, in some ways, of Britons’ willingness to put ourselves out for others. Thankfully, this isn’t another Eyam. But we have a choice about whether to be vicars or squires, all the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b12ef4d73937d51ec1bebcef4a305e1cffa920/75_0_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bd962d8deaff9344400ec5f6f99952b","title":"humanities british government culture","story":"The strain of conservatism that has now taken up residence in Downing Street is tireless in its identification of enemies. The BBC and Channel 4 were put on notice during the latter stages of the election campaign, and the government is now openly pursuing the termination of the BBC licence fee. Dominic Cummings’ long-harboured resentment towards civil service mandarins is driving Whitehall reform, imperilling its independence.The vanguard of rightwing thinktanks and newspapers is redoubling its attacks on universities, with a pitifully thin Policy Exchange report on the topic this week earning a Times headline decrying these “sneering” institutions. Meanwhile, a bogey-ideology known as “wokeness”, constructed by conservative commentators and “free speech” advocates, now serves as an all-purpose bin into which any form of activism, complaint or critical theory can be thrown.These various hostilities are often lumped together as symptoms of a culture war, in which the demographic and educational isions that came to light around Brexit are amplified and exploited for political gain. But we can be more specific than that. The new conservative ideology coalesces around one theme in particular: hostility towards the modern humanities, and their elevated status in British public life.The 20th century witnessed a distinctive model of interlocking political, educational and artistic institutions, with the humanities at their core. Public bodies such as the British Academy and the BBC set the template for the optimistic, post-1945 era of public investment in the arts and humanities. The state actively supported their expansion after the war via such icons of mass cultural modernity as the Arts Council, BBC2, the Open University and the new redbrick universities. By the 1980s, this project had born such fruits as the South Bank Show, the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies and Channel 4. Threaded through all of this was the principle that there was a public interest in understanding ideas, artefacts and events.Cummings has never hidden his contempt for humanities subjects, forged partly out of his own experience of studying history at Oxford. He has been a long-term advocate for an expansion of Stem (science, technology, engineering, maths) in the school curriculum, and for attracting more Stem graduates into the civil service. His notorious blog-cum-recruitment ad, which sought to attract data scientists and “weirdos” to Whitehall, was also notable for its dismissal of “Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers”.More fundamentally, the humanities play a pivotal ideological role for contemporary conservatism: they sit in the crosshairs of both Thatcherite neoliberals and nationalists. It is often difficult for free marketeers to find common ground with nationalists, especially on issues such as immigration. The possession of a shared enemy provides coherence to an otherwise unwieldy coalition. The figure of the publicly funded humanities graduate, whose cultural privilege grants them access to the London elite, fuels a paranoid fantasy that is now central to conservative ideology.The neoliberal position is that a humanities degree is a simple waste of money, as revealed in the earnings of graduates. To people of this mindset, the benefit of the post-2010 tuition fee regime, allied to a host of league tables and audits, is that it exposes latent inequalities in higher education that were previously concealed by public funding. If somebody chooses to study art history (and not, say, computer science), then this is a high-risk investment, which they should be personally liable for. The recent announcement by the University of Sunderland that it would be terminating all its history, languages and politics courses, and replacing them with vocational alternatives, therefore represents progress.The nationalist concern is very different, and stems especially from the perceived influence of continental philosophy over the past 50 years. For those who buy into rightwing conspiracy theories about “cultural Marxism” or the milder anxiety surrounding postmodernism, humanities graduates are an enemy within, a segment of the liberal elite that lacks national loyalty.Opposition to public institutions such as the BBC has been incubated by Rupert Murdoch and his newspapers for many years. More recently, Brexit has given nationalists the confidence to cast suspicions upon a wide array of independent public bodies, from universities to the Bank of England. One thing that neoliberals and nationalists can agree on is that anyone whose education and career has been spent in publicly funded liberal institutions, telling a story about “the public interest” is a fraud. The popular appeal of Johnsonism lies in its antipathy to this elite.But in favour of what exactly? The Cummings plan is for esoteric forms of rationalism to topple the humanities: not just data scientists but game theorists, cognitive scientists, software developers and “people who never went to university” should shape government thinking. This is a vision of society as a programmable machine, a form of post-humanism, which denies that culture or history require any specialist interpretation, but merely provide more data to be fed into predictive mathematical models. The social sciences and humanities will eventually be taken over by physicists.If Cummings wants to accelerate away from the 20th century, then conservative traditionalists want to reverse it. If, as the economics professor Thomas Piketty argues, we are returning to a form of oligarchy last seen prior to the first world war, one can easily envisage how the arts and humanities will be sustained: via the patronage of the rich and the indulgences of their children. The brief historical period, when learning about literature or, yes, Lacan, was a gift from the state, accessible to all regardless of background, is firmly over.It is telling that, while Cummings wants to hire people who use “analytical languages: eg Python, SQL, R”, Boris Johnson is just as likely to lapse into Latin. The liberal humanities are being caught in a pincer movement, between hyper-modern futurism and pre-modern classicism. Taken to extremes, the dream of wiping away modern culture in the name of some distant future and some primordial past has inspired the most hideous of rightwing regimes. Even at its mildest, this is a project that sees little intrinsic value in a public library, a primetime documentary or a history degree.The 20th-century cultural establishment has plenty of failings, which are readily exposed by its opponents. It has never been as inclusive as its rhetoric pretends, and it is far from democratic. Resentment towards cultural and political elites has clearly been brewing for decades, especially among non-Londoners and non-graduates – an electoral goldmine for Johnson. Too often, these elites have reflexively countered the attacks of Thatcherites and the Murdoch press by closing ranks, relying on the power of their contact books, free tickets and charm, but only deepening the sense of metropolitan luvvies doing favours for each other. The defence of universities and the BBC is going to be an important test case for how much of that establishment survives this government.• William Davies is a sociologist and political economist.

The seminar was on the north-south ide, and the word was London. It was obsessive. Why does London keep taking our best people, everyone asked? Why do our children all want to get to London?This week’s report by Lord Kerslake on the north-south ide presents the problem in graphic terms. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Britain with the widest regional inequality of any advanced nation. London’s economy is growing at between two and four times the rate of the north. It is blessed with better health, better trains, better skills. The south-east has largely escaped austerity, its public spending rising £2bn in a decade. The north’s has fallen by £6bn. Fixing this gap will require action “on a level with Germany post-unification”, the report says, when trillions were spent over decades on the former east.Some of this gloom is misleading. Surveys claim London is the least happy region in the land, the north far more content. The OECD and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have also shown that inequality in Britain is less between north and south than between particular places. Leeds contrasts with Rotherham. East London is poorer than Harrogate.Kerslake is aware of the need, but he does not address the issue obsessing my Mancunians. To them the issue was London, seen as exciting, creative, rich – an existential menace. Rulers since Elizabeth I have tried to reduce its appeal. She tried to send her courtiers back to their country estates, and failed. London has always been the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, and is still – now more than ever.My economics tutor used to warn us that much of what he taught might one day be proved wrong, but he hoped at least to have showed us how to recognise nonsense. A case in point must be Kerslake’s solution to the north, which tallies with Boris Johnson’s old-Labour cliche of “levelling-up”. It lies in vast dollops of public investment in infrastructure, in interconnectivity, skills and “cross-governmental, ministerially led” coordination. This is the same language used by Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair – every prime minister– usually in the year after an election.None of this addresses what Manchester understands, that you will not level up the north without levelling down London. The capital has to reduce its appeal to the north’s most precious resource, its creative talent and entrepreneurial zeal. This requires big regional cities to develop “creative critical mass”. They must treasure their heritage, their converted mills, their historic districts – anything to distract their young people from craving a move to London. This may involve sucking energy from their surrounding towns – as Leeds has from Bradford. Cities such as Frankfurt, Toulouse, Milan and Barcelona have established a cultural self-confidence that has succeeded in resisting the magnetism of their country’s capital. The only city outside London to come near such magnetism is semi-autonomous Edinburgh.In the case of demagnetising London, the task is near insuperable, but it must be attempted. Revival will come from small steps, not giant infrastructures. These steps will never work if they depend on London, on its taxpayers, its civil servants, its government. Dependency economics has been the curse of Scotland and Wales. There is no such thing as public spending-led growth – as has conspicuously failed in eastern Germany. Growth comes from employers and investors being stimulated to exploit local skills and talents. They should pay local taxes and run local government. Northern cities will flourish only when London stops stealing their people, their ideas and their power.If the regions are to rise, London must in some degree fall. It must stop gorging on infrastructure investment – as, mercifully, it may now do on Heathrow expansion. It should stop drawing ever more commuters into its centre, which is what Crossrail and HS2 (now running only to the Midlands) are about. It must stop cramming itself with students, the one truly energising factor in many northern city economies. London’s student fees should soar, and northern ones plummet. The capital should stop receiving the lion’s share of arts subsidy.Kerslake rightly acknowledges that Britain must decentralise government power. But how many times must we hear this trotted out? Experience abroad advises accountable local mayors, delegated taxes, borrowing powers and no more reliance on begging from Whitehall.I believe this will never happen until those with power are physically ejected from the capital. Civil servants and politicians (and journalists) must go north. The increasingly dysfunctional Houses of Parliament should abandon their billion-pound gilded temporary outposts in Westminster, and go north for five years. It would refresh them and it would certainly refresh the nation.Demoting London to promote the regions would not necessarily mean a richer Britain, though the present imbalance must be damaging to national prosperity. Wealth is not the issue. Brexit has shown it is now subservient to populist slogans such as patriotism and group identity. One such “identity” is the north, and it has shown itself politically toxic. The north-south ide must be countered. This will happen only if the “levelling” is real. London should ready itself for a hit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73657714f9771ae7868fa74ca66a79372d457251/0_0_941_579/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0f53ddbe3ad5e26ae3168dac86deaaba 1290w","title":"met metropolitan museum art new york mark 150th anniversary time themed fashion show","story":"New York exhibition will make case for fashion as a time-bending force, says curator“For what more terrifying revelation can there be than that it is the current moment?” wrote Virginia Woolf in her 1928 time-travelling classic, Orlando. “That we survive the shock at all is only possible because the past shelters us on one side, the future on another.”These ever-relevant words, and other Woolf passages, would soundtrack the politan Museum of Art’s next major exhibition, its curator, Andrew Bolton, said at a press launch in Paris on Thursday.The exhibition – About Time: Fashion and Duration, which opens on 7 May – was conceived to celebrate the New York museum’s 150th anniversary, and will incorporate garments from the institution’s 1870 conception to the present.Rather than presenting a linear history it will make the case for fashion as something that can distil the current moment while also bending and subverting our concept of time, according to Bolton.The show’s framework would be the rival “concepts of temporality” espoused by the poet Charles Baudelaire and the philosopher Henri Bergson, said Bolton.Baudelaire, he said, argued that time, and by extension fashion, was a place of “endless mutability”, continuous and always striving for the new. Bergson challenged this view and “argued that basic sense of temporal succession was an illusion. He contended that time exists as duration, a continuous flow in which thoughts, feelings and memories exist together.”A video installation of black and white photographs drew parallels between old and new: the reptilian curves of a 3D-printed Iris van Herpen dress from 2012 were juxtaposed with a panniered gown by the American couturier Charles James from 1951. The silhouette of a bell-skirted mid-calf gown from 1919 was echoed by a bulbous 2012 Comme des Garçons midi dress.Speaking against the spectacular backdrop of the Musée d’Orsay clockface, Bolton said the exhibition would also feature a giant timepiece created by the artist and set designer Es Devlin.“Fashion’s most distinctive power, one of the most basic, is enabling us to come unstuck from time,” said Bolton. Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of womenswear at Louis Vuitton, argued that clothes were “wearable treasures that can continue to tell their vital stories about who we were, who we are and where we are going”.Addressing the durability of fashion is a timely subject as the industry grapples with issues around sustainability.“In recent years time has dominated discussions within the fashion community,” said Bolton. He added that the accelerated production and consumption of the digital era had benefited companies but had left many designers feeling “creatively constrained”.The impact of the annual Met exhibition will be magnified by the accompanying Met Gala red carpet event – sometimes described as “Halloween for fashion people” – in which celebrities’ outfits will reflect the theme. In previous years, Rihanna has dressed as the pope for an exhibition themed around Catholicism, and Jared Leto carried a replica of his own head as an expression of the theme “camp”.Fashion’s ability to bend time materialised on the Paris catwalk later on Thursday, in a Chloé show packed with references to the 1970s and a Paco Rabanne collection event at which models wore glam-rock platforms with Victorian ruffs and medieval-style chainmail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9997ea560fc87a592c73a1c3a05925d132f4023b/1041_1089_8846_5309/master/8846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d657db834714109f17cd5ffb4e9fe3","title":"art and commerce a history of the art of advertising in pictures","story":"A new book examines the artistic development of advertising and the innovative ways that ads combined images, text and product to communicate and attract potential customers.

Oxford, Sussex, Manchester and Warwick were among the few to employ enough senior black academics to show up in the official statistics.Male professors continue to outnumber females by three to one, or 15,700 to 5,700 in 2018-19. The number of female professors has increased by 1,200 in the five years since 2014-15, and the number of males by half that amount.Previous research has found that UK universities employed just 25 black women as professors. Hesa data published in January suggested that no black staff were employed at the most senior levels of leadership in British universities in 2018-19, which ministers described as “unacceptable”.The latest statistics show that just 75 people on university governing bodies identified as black, out of 3,600 governors in England, Wales and Scotland, including staff and non-staff. Hesa also released figures showing that the dropout rate for first-year students continues to rise, which the Office for Students described as concerning.The breakdown by inidual institutions showed that some alternative providers had very high dropout rates, including the UK College of Business and Computing based in London, which had 80 of its 165 undergraduates fail to continue after their first year.Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said: “With high numbers of students continuing to drop out, this data shows progress is slow from some institutions to tackle the issue. I want universities to step up and take action as we cannot let these students down and let talent go to waste.”Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students, said: “English higher education enjoys internationally high completion rates, but an increase in the proportion of students dropping out is a concern.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd9b41bbaf5c61bc029e4fe48485e5b8a48e474/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a53d4b559a2eb8d1f096eeec352588","title":"ucl eugenics inquiry did not go far enough committee say","story":"Nine members argue inquiry should have investigated recent meeting on eugenics An inquiry into University College London’s historical links with eugenics has issued its final report, despite the fact that a majority of its committee refused to sign it because they felt it did not go far enough.The report of the inquiry, which has taken a year and a half, calls for the names of scientific pioneers who supported the discredited science, including the Victorian scientist and “father of eugenics” Francis Galton, to be erased from buildings and lecture theatres at the university.Nine members of the 16-strong inquiry team refused to sign the report, arguing that they should have investigated a much more recent secret meeting on eugenics run at the university.The group argue that the report ignores many expert testimonies and contains scientific and historical inaccuracies. They plan to distribute an alternative set of recommendations at a UCL town hall meeting on the inquiry on Friday evening.The inquiry did not investigate London Conference on Intelligence meetings on eugenics, which were run at the university by James Thompson, an honorary senior lecturer who has now been stripped of his title. Speakers at these meetings included white supremacists and a researcher who had previously advocated child rape.Andrew Sabisky, the former No 10 adviser who was forced to step down last week because of a furore around his comments on race and intelligence, was listed as a speaker at an LCI meeting at UCL in 2015. Toby Young was forced to resign as a director of the government’s New Schools Network after it was revealed that he also attended one of the meetings.Joe Cain, a professor of the history and philosophy of biology at UCL and one of the dissenting members of the inquiry committee, said: “I tried really hard to get the London Conference on Intelligence on to the agenda of that committee but I met with a brick wall. We absolutely should have talked about it – but we just didn’t.”The university says it conducted a separate inquiry into how Thompson was able to book meeting rooms without its knowledge – which it is also publishing on Friday – and procedures have now been tightened up.But a second member of the inquiry committee, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We definitely should have talked about these meetings. But the big issue is not how a member of staff booked a room, but why someone with his views was a member of staff at all.”They added: “I refused to sign the report largely because of its tendentious focus on race. I have no issue with addressing racism, but the fact is that the early eugenicists at UCL were far more focused on targeting people based on things like poverty or disability.”Cain is also concerned that the inquiry did not probe sufficiently deeply into teaching at UCL. He says that although the report asserts that eugenics is not being taught anywhere in the university, the inquiry team did not investigate whether this was the case.“My God, I hope that’s true, but the fact is we didn’t look. I’m sure students would let us know if the sort of crazy eugenics you see in the LCI meetings were being taught, but eugenics can also be much more subtle than that.”Galton coined the term eugenics and endowed UCL with his personal collection, along with an endowment that funded the country’s first professorial chair of eugenics.Cain was one of the first to call for the renaming of university buildings and already refuses to teach in the Galton lecture theatre. He said he was pleased that the inquiry has instructed the university to issue a “meaningful and effective apology” for the hurt that UCL’s involvement in eugenics had caused BME students and academics.“The history of eugenics reminds us about stigmatisation. It says to members of our community ‘you don’t belong here and you aren’t normal’.”The inquiry’s recommendations include funding new scholarships to study race and racism, a commitment to ensure all UCL students learn about the history and legacy of eugenics, and the creation of a two-year research post to further examine UCL’s history of eugenics.Prof Kalwant Bhopal, the director of the centre for research in race and education at Birmingham University, said the inquiry must not be used as a sticking plaster for racial inequality. “It’s no good just ticking boxes and changing a few names. How will everyday lives change?” she said.Dr Andrew Rutherford, a science broadcaster who teaches at UCL and has just written a book on race, said: “What I’m concerned about is that the gloss of renaming buildings will overshadow the big structural issues that really matter, like why is there such an attainment gap between BME and white students? And why are there so few senior BME academics?”Sandy Ogundele, the black and minority ethnic officer at UCL students’ union, said the report’s recommendations were “a significant first step in a long-term process for UCL to make amends for its deeply troubling ties to eugenics.”Prof Michael Arthur, UCL’s provost, said: “We acknowledge that UCL has a problematic history with eugenics which has, and continues, to cause significant concern for many in our community. This past should not be hidden but openly and critically discussed.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baaabcb849091175ff1222d10fce993d48f34ced/0_22_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e83372aea8fc52c34ae06b39496934","title":"great barrier reef coral bleaching to worsen unless weather conditions change","story":"Cyclone is temporarily cooling distressed corals but experts say parts of reef that previously escaped bleaching are at riskThe Great Barrier Reef is still at risk of a widespread outbreak of coral bleaching despite a cyclone to the far west helping to temporarily cool stressed corals, according to US and Australian science agencies.Clearer skies, weak tides and above-average ocean temperatures are combining to create stressful conditions for corals along much of the world’s largest reef system.Concerns are rising that southern parts of the reef that escaped major bleaching in 2016 and 2017 may be hit in the coming weeks unless weather conditions change.Australia’s marine science agency said on Thursday it was set to deploy a second underwater glider to monitor water temperatures in the central and southern areas of the reef.Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (Nooa) Coral Reef Watch, told  Australia: “Everything seems to be lining up.“The clouds are clearing and we can see the heat is still high and we know the tides will provide less and less mixing. Everything is falling in line for a short sharp bleaching event but the severity of it is difficult to predict.”Corals bleach when they sit in abnormally warm water for too long. The algae that live in the corals and provide much of its nutrients and colour leave their host, leaving a visible white skeleton behind. Corals can recover from mild bleaching.Coral reef systems have been long predicted to be susceptible to global warming. The United Nations science panel has said that even at global heating of 1.2C “most available evidence” showed that in the tropics “coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher”.Dr Katharina Fabricius, a senior principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “The reef is still on a knife edge. The future of the reef now seems to depend on flukes of the weather. That is a big concern.“This is exactly what scientists have been predicting, with an increase in the frequency of bleaching events.”Tropical Cyclone Esther crossed the coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria on Monday morning and while the eye of the cyclone was hundreds of kilometres west, the weather system dragged clouds over the reef, helping to cool temperatures slightly.The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said late Thursday weather conditions over the next few weeks would “play a key role in determining outcomes for the Reef this summer”.Coral bleaching has been occurring on parts of the reef where thermal stress has accumulated the most over summer.The authority said in-shore reefs in the far north had already experienced “widespread bleaching affecting most coral types” but there had been minimal bleaching on outer reefs.So far, only patchy and isolated bleaching had been reported over large parts of the reef, the authority said.Skirving said: “The clouds helped because they cooled things off, but there’s still a lot of heat in the system. It’s hot enough for the corals to be accumulating stress.”He said the mass bleaching event of 1998 across the reef had taken place over the course of just one week.Weak tides for the next week meant there was less mixing of the warmer surface waters with deeper, cooler water.Skirving said if Cyclone Esther had not formed, “it would be already bleaching up and down the reef”.Dr Sophie Dove, an associate professor at the University of Queensland’s Coral Reef Ecosystems Lab, said it was important to differentiate mild bleaching from severe events, where corals appeared starkly white.“If that whiteness persists then we are likely to see mortality,” she said, adding it was too early to say if the current conditions would have a serious impact on the reef.The Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) has been monitoring satellite data, their own weather stations and a network of more than 170 electronic temperature loggers to check temperatures.Craig Steinberg, an oceanographer at Aims, told  Australia that two autonomous underwater gliders were being used to record water temperatures from the surface to a depth of 200 metres.He said after a brief cooling period, “we are now back into a warming phase” in the southern parts of the reef.Temperatures tend to peak on the reef in mid-March.Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said southern parts of the reef had a greater number of coral species that were more susceptible to bleaching.He said: “We are at the stage where there’s enough heat to cause widespread, mild bleaching now, and we have two weeks to go.”Fabricius said she had seen a bleaching event unfolding at Magnetic Island, near Townsville, over the past two weeks.At a snorkel trail at Geoffrey Bay, hard coral species were partially bleached, giant clams were turning white and some acropora corals were showing signs of death.“The forecast for Friday is for 35C with clear skies,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c6f5305c93c5e2f6cc93af7b97a4f87c7a73ee/0_0_5177_3106/master/5177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5004f3b25a333d594cab1f0d00d2b61","title":"underwater photographer of the year 2020 winners in pictures","story":"All the winning images, all the backstories and all the judges’ comments can be found in the The Underwater Photographer of the Year Yearbook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc7153bf03fe332a7ad0d3bdd1ccd0d94ca275f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c57872c205a23ff317fc5f9fdfc6eaa","title":"the best trenchcoats for all ages in pictures","story":"A trench will always be a spring staple.

It’s the story of an urban legend that comes to life, of a slave who was brutally murdered who returns when you say his name five times in a mirror.Two lesser sequels followed but, tidily ignoring their existence, Peele has teamed up with director Nia DeCosta, whose thriller Little Woods garnered strong reviews after premiering at the Tribeca film festival in 2018, for a fresh take.The plot returns to the same area but with a far different community in residence. The surviving baby from the first film, Anthony McCoy, is now a visual artist who becomes interested in the Candyman legend. The film stars Us and Aquaman’s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and If Beale Street Could Talk’s Teyonah Parris.While Tony Todd, who played Candyman in the original, isn’t featured in the trailer, he’s rumoured to return. When asked, DeCosta kept things enigmatic.“I really love Tony Todd,” she said. “He’s iconic. I will say, what we do in this film is … what we do in this film is great, Jordan is great, and I don’t want to give anything away.”She also said that the film, like Peele’s other outings as director, will be a horror that’s heavily influenced by social issues.“Gentrification is what helped us reimagine the story because Cabrini-Green is gone,” she said. “The movie from the 90s has a vision of Cabrini-Green where it’s sort of on its way to being knocked down, so going back there and seeing what’s happened around that area … what we do in our film is talk about the ghosts that are left behind.”Peele has called the first film “one of the few movies that explored any aspect of the black experience in the horror genre in the 90s”.Candyman 2020 will cover the issue of gentrification but producer Ian Cooper has said that it will also take on toxic fandom.“I think my issue with fandom is that it’s really problematic. It’s probably the most problematic thing facing the genre,” he said. “It typically comes with a dogma that is abrasive and that is more resistant to change and permutation than you would think. I think what we’re trying to do with Candyman is both be mischievous in how we address the relationship to the first film but also be very satisfying.”Candyman is released in cinemas on 12 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe3d8cbd7b6e4bf73991f27e3d64bff64ab4bbde/0_0_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f89cd61e08e6c40c912984f9746f11e","title":"the best english language remakes ranked","story":"As Downhill – the underwhelming US remake of Ruben Östlund’s Force Majeure – hits the cinemas, we present the finest reimaginings of foreign-language filmsThe giant Japanese lizard has become a Hollywood fixture in recent years, but it wasn’t always that way. In the west, until the mid-90s, Godzilla – or Gojira, as the purists would have it – was the preserve of supercool hipsters fixated on the rubber-suit kitsch of the original films. This all changed when Roland Emmerich got hold of it it rivals his previous film, Independence Day, for turbocharged mayhem. Though it got pretty bad reviews at the time, it now looks like a presentiment of the trauma launched on New York on 911.This is the second of the brace of bleak film noirs that the émigré director Fritz Lang made at the end of the second world war the other, with the same main cast, was Woman in the Window. Edward G Robinson is the mild-mannered painter who gets turned inside out by grifters Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea. It’s a remake, amazingly, of an early Jean Renoir film called La Chienne, AKA The Bitch. While the Renoir is an early example of onscreen toxic masculinity, geared around the lead character’s humiliation by a prostitute, Lang’s is more mournful and self-hating in tone.James Cameron’s follow-up to Terminator 2 hails from an era when nuclear weapons could be casually detonated as a second supporting climax, and less-than-sensitive portrayals of Middle Eastern ethnicity were no barrier to box-office success. But the basic idea – apparently boring guy is in fact a spy, who then snoops on and terrifies his wife after she contemplates hooking up with someone who is pretending to be a spy – is taken from the 1991 French film La Totale!, starring Thierry Lhermitte and Miou-Miou. The Cameron remake did wonders for Jamie Lee Curtis’s reputation for slinkiness, and showed that Arnold Schwarzenegger could in fact pull off sophisticated, grownup comedy. So a win all round.Perhaps not a strict remake, but the second go at the 1949 memoir by nun-turned-Nazi-escapee Maria von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. A German film of the story, The Trapp Family, was released in 1956 to considerable success. That directly inspired the 1959 Broadway show, which replaced the Austrian folk songs of the film with Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers. Fast forward six years, and Julie Andrews is warbling that the hills are alive. A huge commercial success, it is the sixth highest grossing film of all time, after inflation is taken into account.Martin Scorsese got his long overdue best director Oscar for this knotty gangstercrime thriller, a reworking of the cult Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs. Scorsese and writer William Monahan tweaked the original’s triad infiltration plot to resemble the Whitey Bulger case, more directly dramatised in the Johnny Depp flick Black Mass. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are police moles in a Boston mob run by Jack Nicholson’s Frank Costello, but with differing loyalties. An excellent late-phase Scorsese, which by no means overshadows the equally good Andrew LauAlan Mak predecessor.Terry Gilliam’s post-apocalyptic fable, which starred Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe and gave Brad Pitt an early eye-catching role, is arguably the director’s most accomplished film: a really meaty subject, dressed up with his customarily idiosyncratic design. It’s all a long way from its source material, the half-hour short La Jetée, by celebrated French avantgardist Chris Marker. That unspools as a sequence of black and white still pictures, accompanied by a ruminative voiceover.Writer-director Steven Soderbergh seemed to be courting trouble with his attempt to re-do Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1972 masterwork taking on a film of that stature is tough. Soderbergh said he was going back to the original novel, by the Polish writer Stanisław Lem. But the essentials of both films are the same: a psychologist, Kelvin, aboard a mission to investigate a mysterious, hallucination-inducing planet called Solaris, has to contend with the resurrection of painful memories including of his long-dead wife. Tarkovsky’s film is a languid, internalised meditation with an eye on the sublime Soderbergh’s is trimmer and blunter, but just as moving in its way.With its title borrowed from David Hockney, this is not a formal remake of Jacques Deray’s late-60s beautiful-people jealousy drama La Piscine (with Alain Delon, Romy Schneider and Jane Birkin). But the director, Luca Guadagnino, working from a script by David Kajganich, has taken the same basic elements – four people holed up together in a holiday home, a seething cauldron of desire, betrayal, murder – and made some impressive additions: Ralph Fiennes’ amazing frugging, Tilda Swinton’s near-silent performance and topical comment on Italy’s refugee crisis.Clint Eastwood has never been hip, exactly, but there was a time when he exuded a sort of counter-culture credibility – and it’s largely down to this brilliant film from Sergio Leone, which introduced the idea of the “spaghetti western” to the world. As has been exhaustively documented, Dollars is in fact a key piece in a jigsaw of east-west cultural exchange: Leone had seen and was inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s 1961 swordsman picture Yojimbo, which itself had taken key ideas from Dashiell Hammett (notably The Glass Key and Red Harvest). Leone never acknowledged the films’ similarities, and later settled out of court with Kurosawa. But Fistful’s legacy lives on: not only in its sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but also in spaghetti’s enduring influence via obsessives of the Tarantino persuasion.Along with everything else, Billy Wilder was an amazing magpie of a film-maker: everything from news stories about kids in wells to Hungarian one-act plays were grist to the mill. This, possibly his greatest film, and arguably the finest comedy ever to come out of Hollywood, is a credited remake of a pre-war French film, Fanfare d’amour (AKA Fanfare of Love), with Fernand Gravey and Julien Carette in the roles later taken by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Wilder’s version, of course, benefited hugely from its comedy St Valentine’s Day massacre opening, Curtis’s Cary Grant impression and Marilyn Monroe at her va-va-voomiest. It also helped put the boot into the Hays Code, after it became a box-office hit despite being denied an approval certificate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c3233545f70f589b2e4bbb60b27cf6307da698/425_884_4942_2965/master/4942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a5d2a3c053e00f67c627bd39c8fee9e","title":"people are starting to wake up berlin film festival spotlights australias unfinished business","story":"After Nightingale and Sweet Country swept Venice, stories highlighting Australian political injustice have dominated the country’s Berlinale contingent“There’s always been a hunger for Indigenous stories that haven’t been given to an audience,” the Australian director Warwick Thornton says.We’re at the Berlin international film festival where, later that day, the second season of Mystery Road – directed by Thornton and Wayne Blair – will premiere to rapturous applause.Mystery Road – an outback neo-noir starring the Indigenous actor Aaron Pedersen – is one of eight Australian projects screening at Berlinale this year, two more of which forefront Indigenous Australian stories. One is the feature film High Ground which centres on the bloody massacre of a Yolngu tribe at the end of Australia’s frontier wars, and the other is Tony Briggs’s short film Elders which wordlessly follows a young boy as he searches for his grandparents out in the bush, alone.Directed by Stephen Maxwell Johnson (Yolngu Boy), High Ground stars Jack Thompson and Simon Baker alongside Witiyana Marika and Jacob Junior Nayinggul – a screen debut for both actors from Arnhem Land. Since its premiere this week, the film – which plays as a rip-roaring western against the starkly remote Northern Territory outback – has been described as been “relentless” and “unflinching”, words which echo the critical reception of other Australian films to have premiered at international festivals in recent years.Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale, for instance, shocked audiences in 2018 with its graphic, uncompromising look at Tasmania’s dark colonial past, and Thornton’s Sweet Country in 2017 was a scathing reminder of the systemic racial ide underlaying Australia’s history. Both won the special jury prize at the Venice film festival in those consecutive years.Why are these stories of Australia’s Indigenous injustice resonating so strongly with the international industry? Does it represent a new yearning for work that challenges Australia’s white-washed history?Maryanne Redpath is the Australian and New Zealand delegate for Berlinale who advises in the selection of films for both countries. She believes the answer comes down to a certain trend among programming that she describes as “collective internationality”: the Australian works making an impact are those that aren’t shying from Australia’s political climate, and its relationship to the world.“There’s a lot of unfinished business in Australia and people are starting to wake up. That’s getting reflected in the industry,” she says. “We need to address the Australian value of, ‘She’ll be alright’ because she’s not alright at the moment.”Notably Redpath singles out Australia’s deplorable legacy of colonisation as a much-needed point of re-evaluation: “We need to address … where we are now, how we looked at ourselves, and how the world looks at us.”It’s in that spirit that ABC TV drama Stateless premiered at Berlinale on Wednesday night.Co-produced by Cate Blanchett, Tony Ayres and Elise McCredie, and inspired by real Australian stories, the show digs deep into the traumas suffered by those detained inside an immigration detention centre in South Australia, interrogating its suffocating effects upon not only the detainees but the guards and bureaucrats bound up in the system.Julia Fidel, head of the new Berlinale series section which is dedicated to longform television, says she was struck by the show, not just because it shone a light on the Australian government’s abhorrent treatment of vulnerable and marginalised people, but because it offered a valuable non-European perspective to the refugee crisis.“Stateless really gives you the full picture of that global impact,” Fidel says. “We all live in a very connected world which you can’t walk away from. It’s going to affect you wherever you are, whoever you are.”The power of these Australian stories to reach global audiences answers a need for “new voices”, Redpath says, and if their success continues it could open up the door for more boundary-pushing work by erse storytellers.Briggs is a Wurundjeri (Woiwurrung) and Yorta Yorta actor who wrote the hit 2012 film the Sapphires. Making his directorial debut at Berlinale this year with Elders, he says new spaces are being opened up for film-makers who have previously been marginalised, including women and people of colour.“We can understand that together, unified, we can create something incredibly positive and universal,” he says. “We are and can be in control of that narrative.”• Berlin film festival continues until 1 March.

By  Kieran MorrisFew restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce reciism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu.Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?”It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.Chefs were once courtiers then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes.The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce.Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.”The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”.Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.”One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.”So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”.Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”.What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey.El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary bioersity of Scandinavia.Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.”A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park.Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and bioersity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded iniduals in cooking and hospitality skills.Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.Roberto Flore, former head of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.”Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11042566de91a3b3be1bcefa6e5bc2b039fba35d/1_212_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04acb906b2b563f6cc7a5432b983fa66","title":"arsenal olympiakos europa league match report","story":"This was a lesson Arsenal had to learn eventually but it could not have come at a more costly moment. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has spent two years bailing out sluggish performances and embodying a model of consistency in a team that has shown none. He seemed to have done it yet again, with the stakes perhaps higher than ever, when he arched his back and cracked in a breathtaking overhead volley seven minutes from the end of extra time, restoring their aggregate lead with his first significant involvement of the game. But then came two stark, devastating reminders that Mikel Arteta’s rebuilding job has barely scratched the surface.Olympiakos would, on this showing, have been unfortunate not to reach the last 16 and they received one last chance to load the Arsenal box when Bernd Leno conceded a corner under little pressure. There followed an object lesson, and not the night’s first, in how not to defend after a set piece: although the initial cross was cut out by Gabriel Martinelli, he could not get out quickly enough to prevent Giorgos Masouras having another go and from there the die was cast. Masouras’s inswinging, left-foot delivery was good enough to ask questions and the response was, from an Arsenal perspective, nonexistent. David Luiz watched the ball float in front of him as if oblivious to the danger that lay behind, where a flat-footed Sokratis Papastathopoulos had given Youssef El Arabi space to stab in from six yards and spark a mini pitch invasion from the visiting staff.You can have all the world-class strikers on the planet, but you cannot legislate for a backline that falls far short of where Arteta requires Arsenal to be. Unfortunately you cannot legislate for those rare moments when your centre-forward malfunctions, either. El Arabi’s goal had come with a minute to play but, incredibly, there remained time for Aubameyang to contrive an improbable miss. A ricochet found him alone in front of goal but, beyond every expectation, he blasted wide there was to be no saviour act after all but no blame ought to linger his way.“I feel very, very bad,” a desolate Aubameyang said afterwards. “But it can happen. I don’t know how I missed this chance.” He deserved credit for facing the cameras but this outcome, which removes a huge chunk of meaning from Arsenal’s season, cannot be pinned on him. They had done the hard part, or so it seemed, by winning in Piraeus and should have been able to complete the job against opponents who do not travel well. Arteta had picked a full-strength team in a clear indication of the night’s importance: Arsenal need to be in the Champions League and a sensible performance would have greatly improved their prospects of getting there via this competition.They started too slowly, barely creating a chance in the first 45 minutes.While Olympiakos were little better, they could point to a miss by Abdoulaye Camara that set alarm bells ringing and the sense, at half-time, was that Arsenal had thrown them a bone. Arteta has drilled shape and structure into what is essentially a mediocre bunch of that there is no doubt. But they are not good enough to offer practised opposition this much of a sniff and, when Mathieu Valbuena swirled over a 53rd-minute corner, the point was underscored. Pape Abou Cissé, given a clear run on to the ball as it sailed over Shkodran Mustafi, nodded it past Leno and from that moment Arsenal were walking on eggshells.Internazionale came from behind on the night to beat Ludogorets 2-1 at an eerily quiet San Siro, completing a 4-1 aggregate victory in a game played behind closed doors due to coronavirus fears.No fans were present at the 70,000-capacity stadium as a near-post finish from Cristiano Biraghi and a Romelu Lukaku header denied the Bulgarians, who had taken the lead through Cauly Souza.It seemed like a training session, playing behind closed doors created a very strange atmosphere, said Inter coach Antonio Conte. The lads did well to put things back in place immediately after we suffered the goal.It was a night to forget for Portuguese sides, with Benfica, Porto and Sporting all joining Braga in going out at the last-32 stage. Benfica drew 3-3 with Shakhtar Donetsk in Lisbon, losing 5-4 overall, while Porto were outclassed by Leverkusen, who won 5-2 on aggregate.Sporting were twice within a minute of overcoming Istanbul Basaksehir, only for Edin Visca to score on both occasions – first to send the game into extra time, and then to complete a 5-4 aggregate win from the penalty spot. Jaime Mata\u0027s early goal for Getafe made the difference as they edged out Ajax despite a 2-1 defeat in Amsterdam.Elsewhere, Justin Kluivert cancelled out Jonathan David\u0027s opener as Roma progressed with a 1-1 draw at Gent, while Sevilla were held to a 0-0 draw by Cluj, but edged through on away goals.There were moments when a happier outcome seemed possible, not least when the frustrating Nicolas Pépé’s effort was parried by José Sá, but Arteta’s post-match assertion that Arsenal had created enough chances felt like a mechanism for protecting his players. Olympiakos carried a constant threat on the break and, before the late drama took hold, could have found a winner when Masouras’s dipping effort clipped the bar. They had started the match tentatively but could not fail to detect the skittishness in Arsenal, which manifested itself in cheap concessions across their entire team. It had been hard to identify a major weapon in Pedro Martins’ side during the first leg but they grew in stature here, too often reducing Arsenal to a scurrying, confused unit more reminiscent of Unai Emery’s latter days.Perhaps things would have been different if Mustafi’s 103rd-minute departure through injury had not disrupted Arsenal’s defence Papastathopoulos looked well off the pace in his cameo. But ultimately this was a night of huff and puff, with too much onus on one man to blow the house down. Arteta believes Aubameyang is keen to stay at Arsenal beyond the end of his contract, which expires next summer, but he will want to offer his star turn a seat at the top table. Their best chance to take one may have evaporated and the consequences could yet be far-reaching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7912e8c04bedf71ab8dd7e9281c54d03099a4528/316_223_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfea48f3da558c6f38c3a6b6fbf379d","title":"manchester united club brugge europa league match report","story":"Another scintillating Bruno Fernandes display swept Manchester United into the last 16 and on this showing they are serious contenders for a second Europa League crown in three years.Fernandes’s vision gives United a new dimension and elevates his teammates. The playmaker scored a second penalty in two games and though naysayers may claim this was “only” Club Brugge, United have struggled against similar opponents under Ole Gunnar Solskjær. This was a performance that crushed the visitors and took United to seven matches unbeaten, a run that includes six clean sheets.It left the manager pleased. “I’m very happy tonight,” he said . “When you score goals and play like this it gives more confidence.”Odion Ighalo made a first start owing to Anthony Martial’s muscle injury, while Scott McTominay ended a two-month absence as Solskjær made seven changes from the first leg. The start was fast and furious. Juan Mata fired from 20-yards and forced Simon Mignolet to parry. The goalkeeper fired a long clearance into David Okereke’s path and though Harry Maguire was left flailing United scrambled clear.United were further troubled when Maxim De Cuyper crossed from the left and Sergio Romero inadvertently punched the ball to Mats Rits who ballooned over.The pace was relentless as the outstanding Fernandes. If he was left frustrated after a foray that allowed him to unload a shot only for Mignolet to keep the match goalless but the deadlock seemed unlikely to last.. It was soon broken in farcical circumstances. Daniel James’s shot was curling into the corner before Simon Deli flung himself to his left in what would have been a save-of-the season contender if he was a goalkeeper.Serdar Gozubuyuk awarded the penalty for handball and showed the defender a red card but the comedy continued when the referee reviewed the incident on the pitch-side monitor. He confirmed the original decision and Fernandes, whose wait stretched past four minutes, converted. “I don’t know why the boy did it,” said Solskjær of Deli. “But that is not a fair attempt to stop a goalscoring opportunity.”United’s control had tightened so they needed to turn their dominance into more goals. McTominay teed up James but he could not finish so Ighalo showed him how, courtesy of some fine Fernandes trickery. He twisted to the left of Brugge’s area and floated in a ball that reached Mata at the far post. His return pass was slide-rule precise for Ighalo, who bundled in a classic sniffer’s finish for his first goal for the club.The on-loan man went close to a second when holding off Federico Ricca but Mignolet saved. He could do nothing about the third, though. Fernandes – again the creator – tee-ed up McTominay and from outside the area the midfielder passed the ball precisely into the bottom corner.Internazionale came from behind on the night to beat Ludogorets 2-1 at an eerily quiet San Siro, completing a 4-1 aggregate victory in a game played behind closed doors due to coronavirus fears.No fans were present at the 70,000-capacity stadium as a near-post finish from Cristiano Biraghi and a Romelu Lukaku header denied the Bulgarians, who had taken the lead through Cauly Souza.It seemed like a training session, playing behind closed doors created a very strange atmosphere, said Inter coach Antonio Conte.

His first contribution was to fall on his backside under pressure from Odilon Kossounou. When Mata was downed under the same player’s attention it was ruled a foul to the left of the D, but Fernandes spooned it wide.United were in cruise control playing pinball football at will and serving notice that no one will want to draw them in the last 16. Chong came off worse in a collision with Mignolet but was able to continue and when Fernandes’s match ended after 65 minutes he wandered off to deserved applause. Chong grew into the match as illustrated by a run and cross that fell invitingly to Luke Shaw.Mason Greenwood entered for the closing stages and though the 18-year-old is United’s top-scorer in the competition it was left to Fred to complete the rout, scoring twice in the last eight minutes.Solskjær could joke about this. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be alive the next time he scored a goal,” he said of the Brazilian.."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94990abb85b816dddffe7845b2785eeb86fb935/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6edcfc0f4122937b0cfe53564a92623","title":"premier league and carabao cup 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Villa try to break Manchester City’s League Cup stranglehold, Vardy needs a goal and Moyes must rouse Hammers• Norwich v Leicester (Friday, 8pm, all times GMT)When Manchester City were rocking on their heels in the Bernabéu, it was Fernandinho who cleared heads with two brilliant blocks of goalbound shots. Wednesday’s famous win was another reminder of just how integral the Brazilian has been to the club’s journey into the heart of the European elite. All four of Pep Guardiola’s starting defence – Benjamin Mendy, Kyle Walker, Nicolás Otamendi, and Aymeric Laporte had struggled – but the latter’s departure with the muscle injury that will preclude his involvement at Wembley brought the veteran Brazilian back into commission from the substitutes’ bench. He and Kevin De Bruyne subsequently inspired City to the club’s finest European night in half a century. On Sunday, Fernandinho, David Silva and Sergio Agüero, fellow survivors from the 2013-14 final victory over Sunderland that began City’s recent dominance of the competition, are in line to collect their fifth League Cup winners’ medals,matching Ian Rush’s record. Whatever lies in City’s clouded future, the question of who could replace a player so crucial in both defence and midfield does not present an easy answer. JBFor all that many Premier League clubs prioritise the sizzling excitement of finishing 14th above the mundanity of winning actual trophies, there is no excuse for Aston Villa not to go for it against Manchester City in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final. For a start there’s Villa’s venerable League Cup tradition – its first winners, in 1961, and victors of memorable finals in 1977, 1994 and 1996 – and then there’s the fact that victory will make no difference to existing fixture burdens. And given poor recent league performances, a feisty showing at Wembley, with the Premier League pressure off, can serve as a morale booster. Of course, Villa’s injury depletions, leaky defence and City’s dizzying, rotating array of attacking talent could make for another horribly one-sided domestic cup final, but Dean Smith’s side tasted Wembley glory last year too and shouldn’t be overawed. TDWith Manchester City not in league action this weekend this is an opportunity for Liverpool can open their lead at the top to a ludicrous 25 points – more than opponents Watford’s haul for the season so far. Nigel Pearson’s first game as Watford manager came at Anfield in December, an impressive performance that nevertheless ended in a 2-0 defeat and presaged their Yuletide mini-surge. “When they came here it was a tough game,” Trent Alexander-Arnold said this week. “With the new manager, it’s tough to break them down.” Well, not that tough – their past five opponents have managed it, and one of them was Tranmere. The Hornets have several players returning from injury, including Tom Cleverley and Ismaïla Sarr, who both came off the bench at Old Trafford last week, and the question is whether it is worth risking their recuperation in this game, which they are unlikely to win whoever they choose, or wiser to protect them for more important and winnable battles. SBDuring their horror-run of fixtures, West Ham pretty much met expectations – losing each of the games everyone thought they would, and surrendering a two-goal lead to draw the one they might have won. David Moyes’ side are in dire need of a victory that will haul them out of the relegation zone. Their fine performance in defeat at Liverpool bodes well going into their game against Southampton, but few among West Ham’s fans will be confident of seeing a repeat of such industrious vim and vigour. Moyes has talked a good game during his side’s recent run of bad results and on Monday night his team played one. A manager who is surely in the last chance saloon as far as future Premier League appointments are concerned, Moyes will have few more sterner tests of his motivational skills than Saturday’s game in Stratford. BGGraham Potter emerged from Bramall Lane last week with a 1-1 draw, reward for some productive tactical nurdling as Brighton started with three centre-backs and two strikers for the first time since the early weeks of the season. “I think I have had a decent coaching career so far and you don’t have that by doing the same thing all the time,” he said afterwards. So Crystal Palace should expect the unexpected on Saturday. Neal Maupay’s goal in Sheffield was his first since December, at Palace, and might be enough for him to keep his place after a couple of games on the bench. His partner in attack last week, Glenn Murray, has scored in his past three games against Palace but that wasn’t enough to get him on the pitch when they last met. Brighton’s last three league games, and five of their last seven, have ended in score draws. A first league win in 2020 would boost their fight against relegation before a testing run of fixtures. SBThere are only two Premier League teams who have won more points away from home than at their own stadium his season: Southampton and Chelsea. Defeat to Bayern Munich on Tuesday was Chelsea’s eighth home defeat of the season in all competitions, while Bournemouth won at Stamford Bridge in December. Chelsea’s ongoing run of five home games in six is not particularly helpful: they have lost two of the first three matches in that sequence already. Since winning at Chelsea, Bournemouth have won twice in 10 league matches, and should present the Blues with an opportunity to further damage their statistics on Saturday. SBNewcastle could do without having to entertain a Burnley side whose recent league run of four wins and a draw has put them within sight of European qualification. Seven points clear of the drop but with one win in nine league games, Newcastle are sinking fast. Steve Bruce faces more conundrums than a whole series of Countdown contestants, most puzzling among them how to get the best out of Joelinton. With only one league goal this season, the Brazilian is clearly unsuited to the role of lone frontman performed so well by Salomón Rondón last season. With Andy Carroll injured, either dropping him in favour of Dwight Gayle or pairing the duo together seems worth a punt. Gayle’s record of 21 Premier League goals in 109 appearances isn’t particularly impressive, but he is a snarling terrier with a proven top-flightrecord, which is more than can be said of his teammate. The pair spent only 89 minutes on the pitch together in the aforementioned run of games without mustering a goal between them, but with Joelinton looking consistently lost, it is difficult to imagine this is an offensive gamble that isn’t worth taking.. BGHaving lost against Chelsea last weekend after adopting an astonishingly negative approach, it will be intriguing to see how Tottenham line up against Wolves, who are only a point behind them in the hunt for a Champions League place. Considering they were equally negative in defeat at the hands of RB Leipzig in the Champions League, the smart money would go on the heroically stubborn José Mourinho doing much the same. The absences of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min at least provide him with ready-made excuses in the event of defeat. There is no shame whatsoever in losing to an exciting Wolves team, but – with or without their key absentees – the sight of Spurs going down without a fight at home following last weekend’s abject performance is likely to prompt rumblings of discontent, something that has been largely absent around the well-appointed home stands. BGEven amid the plunging depths to which Manchester United have descended at times this season, Ole Gunnar Solskjær has repeatedly harked back to a specific low point in his time as manager. Goodison Park last April – a 4-0 defeat to an Everton team managed by Marco Silva that were hardly pulling up trees was a very public humiliation. Solskjær, previously a picture of positivity and bringer of 1999 Treble vibes, angrily promised a clear-out of a team of undeserving sloths. “I want my team to be the hardest-working team in the league, that is what we were under Sir Alex,” he said. Ten months on, only Chris Smalling, Ashley Young and Romelu Lukaku have actually fled the nest, with Paul Pogba on standby. The Norwegian’s team are configured rather differently than they were 10 months ago, and United can hardly play much worse than they did then. That said, they are also coming up against a far superior Everton team, who continue to improve under Carlo Ancelotti and were impressive even in defeat last week at Arsenal.

Designed to potentially “save millions of lives and entire economies” by speedily funnelling money to nations facing pandemics.But critics say the “insanely complicated” terms of the high-interest bonds are heavily skewed towards investors, while for the victims any payouts may come too late, if at all.One economist described the bonds, payouts from which depend on how deadly the outbreak is, as “obscene”.Olga Jonas, a senior fellow at Harvard Global Health Institute who was an economist at the World Bank for three decades, said: “The whole mechanism is highly unfortunate. The objectives were to help the poorest countries respond quickly to outbreaks. Infectious disease spreads exponentially and the coronavirus has a very rapid growth rate. But the bonds only get triggered when the disease has spread for a long time.”Jonas, who has analysed the bonds’ terms, said they were “so convoluted, it is not at all clear whether they will pay out at all. It is too little, too late – and in this case, maybe never.“What’s obscene is that the World Bank set it up this way. It waits for people to die.”Funds can only be released after a certain amount of time and in accordance with complex criteria including outbreak size, growth rate, deadlines and death tolls. In the case of coronavirus, the bonds would not pay out until 12 weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) publishes its first “situation report”, which would not be until 23 March. Another criteria is that the outbreak is still growing.The bonds, funded by donor nations Japan and Germany, deliver interest payments to investors until the conditions for an infectious disease outbreak are triggered.The value of the bonds has halved as the coronavirus outbreak has spread, raising fears investors could face losses.Meanwhile, the WHO has appealed for £520m for “frontline efforts” to contain coronavirus. The disease has infected more than 82,000 people and killed over 2,800 people in 51 countries to date, but has not yet been declared a pandemic by the WHO.Clare Wenham, assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, said: “If you really wanted to ensure global health security you would link the payout of the bonds to a decision around declaring a public health emergency of international concern or a national emergency.”Wenham co-authored a paper criticising pandemic bonds in which it was found that more money was paid out to investors than to countries facing disease outbreaks. Payments would have only been triggered in two out of more than 60 disease outbreaks analysed – Ebola in west Africa and rift valley fever in 2006, the paper found.Wenham said: “If the aim of it is to prevent pandemics, why would you wait for arbitrary numbers? Global health security is predicated on prevention rather than response, so waiting for it to get to a certain number of deaths in a certain number of countries before they pay out, is counterintuitive. It is not fit for purpose.“No one has thought about it holistically. If public health officials have made a declaration of a global health emergency of international concern, there should be some mechanism for financing so that the WHO doesn’t have to go around the houses asking for money.”Bodo Ellmers, director of Global Policy Forum’s sustainable development finance programme, said: “The idea was that it would be a quick instrument, but it was set up with such stringent criteria that the risk for investors is very low. The design, taking the number of dead people as a criteria, is very cynical.”The scheme’s “fundamental flaw” is that it was aimed at preventing a pandemic but would only pay out when a pandemic was already underway, said Ellmers.The World Bank said a PEF payout had been triggered after the Ebola outbreak of 2018 and 2019 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing a total of $61.4m to fight the disease.The bank added that it has rolled out a series of tools to better assist countries during critical outbreaks, epidemics and pandemic threats.It is capable of fast-tracking funds via existing projects and could fund emergency operations within three months – although in past cases, such as Ebola, it had provided support within two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a764c3422e7475aeb5bdb631b6d9d015aab619ae/0_0_6651_5794/master/6651.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d429bb72e202ba9c0d276aacec82efce 1320w","title":"this spirituality liberates you sufi superstar abida parveen set to transport melbourne","story":"The devotional singer is known to move audiences to a higher plane. Meeting her in Melbourne, Ben Eltham writes, time went ‘all bendy and loose’Sufi superstar Abida Parveen – a giant of world music – is an arresting presence. Dressed in flowing robes and scarf, her hair a mass of handsome dark curls, she seems to carry a little bubble of grace around with her – despite being anchored by pink sneakers.Best known for her command of the ghazal, kafi and qawwali – classic forms of Sufi music and poetry – the colossal artistic stature of Parveen in her homeland of Pakistan is hard to convey for the western reader. As Kamile Shamsie wrote  in 2005, “you could find entire neighbourhoods, possibly towns, in Pakistan where the residents would be delighted to be kept up until dawn by the sound of Parveen”.Melbourne gets her for a single night only, in an exclusive concert that’s part of the three-month Asia Topa festival of Asian performing arts. “I’m very peaceful, it feels like there’s a lot of peace here,” she says when we meet.Parveen began singing as a three-year old, encouraged by her father Ustad Ghulam Haider – himself a famous musician. At his knee, she imbibed the Sufi canon and a respect for its power.Even as a young child she had a “thirst for learning”, she explains through her translator. She would often observe her father with his music students at home, where she learned “the respect of the honour of what this is”.What does it feel like when she’s singing?“Once you’re in this space, this spirituality actually liberates you,” Parveen explains. “You’re not tied by any worldly or materialistic thing.”Every concert is like her very first, she says. “So I pray every time to receive, and once the Divine listens to that, he creates a gathering where I become a channel, and then that flows to everyone who is interested. So that gathering becomes a spreading of the message.”Parveen’s mysticism can belie a more worldly approach to the industry. She is a highly successful commercial artist in Pakistan, and has even appeared as a judge on the Indian-Pakistani talent show Sur Kshetra.But the core of her music is her spirituality, evident not just from her performances, but in the philosophy she brings to her art.“The soul of the heart is what is connected to the Divine. It comes first in my heart, and then to my lips,” she says, in a reference to the great 14th century poet Hafez.Parveen’s manner of speaking has been called “densely poetic”, and it is also in Urdu, which I don’t speak. But even without translation, her lilting cadences are mesmerising, enlivened by flashes of humour.“You will never understand this through logic and brain it always comes through the heart, the heart understands this.”When I ask what that means, she giggles.“You don’t understand it, you can’t understand it yourself!” she tells me, her eyes crinkling with mirth. “Once the heart accepts and submits, then the guidance comes.”At this point Parveen’s translator, Ayesha Bux, explains the word she is using here is ilham, by which she means not simply a message, but ine inspiration.The power of music in a cruel world has never seemed more important than in 2020, a year which has already been dominated by drought, bushfires, a fast-spreading virus and deadly sectarian violence in India.“Even if one person understands in the world, it could bring salvation,” Parveen tells me.“When things like this happen, or when they explode, this is coming from somewhere else – but the solace comes from the Divine.”Here Parveen quotes a well-known Qur’anic reference to David: “The prophet David, peace be upon him, when he started singing, the mountains would sway and the birds would sing.”Called “Abdaji” by her entourage, Parveen seems to effortlessly command any space, even an empty cocktail lounge in the bowels of Melbourne’s Arts Centre. Maybe I’ve had too many coffees, but it seems the room gets quieter when she talks, and time gets all bendy and loose.It’s a phenomenon her fans talk about too, with her performances regularly transporting audiences to a higher plane.“With music, there are only 12 notes. You can’t increase or decrease them. Those 12 notes are coming from the Divine. And the whole world is within them.”• Abida Parveen is singing at the Hamer Hall, Arts Centre Melbourne on Saturday 29 February, as part of Asia Topa festival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214fea0779b4daecfce207fbd29bb82e9611afd5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8faa20e2a73866249769d7fa35e55789","title":"india modi and the rise of hindu nationalism","story":"With Delhi rocked by deadly protests as Muslim and Hindu groups clash violently,  writer Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism within India.

The ex-insider said Tighe was good at his job but Patel had wanted more people in senior roles in the department whom she trusted.The Home Office did not deny the claim that Patel asked for Tighe to be sacked on Christmas Eve, nor that she had wanted him to leave.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary and permanent secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media. They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”Over the last week No 10 has made moves to defuse the public spat, with both Patel and Rutnam told to stop the sniping and restore calm in the Home Office.The row originally blew up when it was claimed that Patel had tried to get rid of Rutnam after he raised complaints about her alleged bullying and belittling of staff.It then further escalated with claims that MI5 had restricted Patel’s access to security information because it did not trust her, which the intelligence agency and home secretary strongly denied.The department has said there have been no formal complaints about Patel’s behaviour.Rutnam made a rare public appearance on Thursday at a policing conference but made only a brief allusion to the reports about his poor relationship with Patel.He told the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster: “You probably have already heard a great deal more about permanent secretaries in the last few days than you ever expected to. But be reassured, I am not going to talk about that. I am going to talk about what really matters, which is cutting crime and building a law enforcement system that is more capable, more resilient and better placed for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17eef303f74b8248fbdc88fc95c60effecbc24c4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b105caf0443ccf70da5676adcd1916","title":"universal credit linked psychological stress increase study benefits uk","story":"Failure to modify benefit is likely to increase pressure on NHS, researchers sayUniversal credit is linked to an increase in “psychological stress” among the jobless people who claim it, according the first major study to quantify the impact of the government’s flagship welfare system on mental health.The study found the introduction of universal credit across the UK was associated with a 6.6 percentage point increase in mental health issues among recipients compared with a comparison group who were in employment or retired.This was the equivalent of an estimated 63,674 unemployed recipients experiencing significant forms of mental distress after signing up to the benefit, of whom a third were likely to have become clinically depressed, researchers concluded.The Liverpool University study, published in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday, comes amid increasing concern about the impact on claimant mental health from welfare policy changes and cuts in recent years, which have reduced the real-terms value of benefits and made them more punitive and harder to access.The researchers said that with another 5 million people expected to move on to universal credit over the next four years, failure to mitigate the stressful impact on claimants would be likely to exacerbate pressures on already-overstretched NHS mental health services.“Our study supports growing calls for universal credit to be fundamentally modified to reduce these mental health harms,” said Dr Sophie Wickham, who led the research. “So far, the government has only looked at the impact of universal credit on the labour market, and there are no plans to assess its effect on health and wellbeing.”Factors identified as potential universal credit “stressors” include a five-week wait for a first benefit payment, issues leading to high levels of claimant debt and rent arrears, sanctions punishments such as the removal of benefits, and difficulties accessing the mainly online system.The study’s co-author Prof Dame Margaret Whitehead said: “Given the mounting evidence of substantial mental health harms related to universal credit, it is crucial that the government conducts a robust health impacts assessment of all welfare reforms, including universal credit.“With nearly two-thirds of households in the UK receiving some kind of welfare benefit, any changes to the welfare system – even those with small inidual effects – could have major implications for the nation’s health.”The study found that universal credit did not appear to have a negative impact on the physical health of claimants. It also found no evidence that the system was associated with more people entering employment, one of the benefit’s key strategic aims.The study was based on interviews with 52,000 people of working age conducted between 2009 and 2018. It excluded people with a disability who claimed other benefits. The authors acknowledged that the study showed “observational associations rather than cause and effect”.A qualitative study published by Newcastle and Teesside Universities last year into how low-income claimants in the north-east of England coped with universal credit found that it had so profoundly affected claimants’ mental health that some had considered suicide.Responding to the Lancet study, Ayaz Manji, a senior policy officer at the charity Mind, said: “It’s wrong that the benefits system … is causing psychological distress among people who need support. We need to see radical solutions to ensure that the benefits system plays its part in helping people stay well.”Labour’s Mike Amesbury, the shadow employment minister, said the study showed universal credit was not working. “This is the latest in a long line of damning independent reports into the impact that universal credit is having on people’s lives … Our social security system should have dignity and security at its heart.”Iain Porter, a policy manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Our social security system should provide a public service people can turn to when they hit hard times. There is nothing compassionate or just about the rollout of universal credit increasing levels of anxiety and stress among low-income families.”The Department for Work and Pensions has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cff192224ced9a89e0168b4885b0b8f04de395/0_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba59cc7037793a90893c28c28629c917","title":"former fa chief ian watmore to take over as chairman of ecb","story":"Ian Watmore, a former FA chief executive and senior civil servant, will succeed Colin Graves as the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.Graves has held the post since May 2015, extending an initial five-year term by six months in order to oversee the inaugural season of The Hundred. He is understood to be in the running to become the next chairman of the International Cricket Council.That position in charge of the world game becomes vacant when India’s Shashank Manohar steps down this year. But Graves, 72, will relinquish his role at the ECB at the end of November regardless, with the governing body announcing on Thursday evening that Watmore is now chair-elect and will begin working in a shadow capacity.Watmore emerged as the nominations committee’s preferred candidate after a selection process overseen by Lucy Pearson, the ECB non-executive director and former international cricketer, and Andrew Strauss, the former England captain and director of cricket who is now chair of the ECB’s cricket committee.The 61-year-old, whose appointment was approved unanimously by the 12-strong ECB board and is now awaiting ratification at the ECB AGM in May, is a former management consultant at Accenture of 24 years who moved into the upper levels of the British civil service in 2004 and has reported to five prime ministers.As well as a brief stint in charge of the FA in 2009, when he oversaw the launch of the Women’s Super League and the St George’s Park Project, Watmore has previously held board positions with the English Institute of Sport, the English Football League and the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Speaking about his appointment, Watmore said: “I am incredibly proud to be appointed to such a prestigious position and look forward to continuing Colin’s work and making the most of the tremendous momentum that cricket is currently enjoying.“I feel privileged to be given this opportunity to help a sport that I care passionately about. All my life, I’ve seen the power of sport to unite communities. I look forward to working with the ECB and its stakeholders to grow the international, domestic and recreational game and make a positive difference to society.”Graves will depart the ECB having overseen the creation of The Hundred as part of a new £1.1bn broadcast deal that begins this year, as well as home World Cup wins for both the men’s and women’s teams and the move to a fully independent ECB board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abcd3b568aefcc7908b95ca716d80cc27cd3d4e2/635_0_3855_2315/master/3855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9532eb8f2300e16bd4de938940c35341","title":"england v pakistan womens twenty20 world cup live","story":"Hello all.

But, a decade on, the cracks are showingIt is 11 years since the show formerly known simply as 10 Years Younger last aired. Back then it was on Channel 4 and briefly hosted by Myleene Klass, but for ever associated with her predecessor, the specs-ellent Nicky Hambleton-Jones. These were the days of Trinny and Susannah’s boob squeezes and “Dr” Gillian McKeith’s miracle mung beans, when looking good meant submitting to the bullying instruction of a questionably qualified TV presenter. Whether audiences were browbeaten or merely bored, makeover shows fell out of favour until Queer Eye’s surprisingly sensitive reboot on Netflix. Now BBC One is launching its first one for 15 years – You Are What You Wear, with Rylan Clark-Neal – and 10 Years Younger is back, too, this time on Channel 5 and under a new guise as 10 Years Younger in 10 Days. But has the scruffy old bag let herself go?If that sounds harsh, remember, we are being invited to pass exactly such judgments on the two women in the first new episode. Gail is a farmer from Northumberland and Sarah is a dog-walker from somewhere down south, but according to the new presenter, Cherry Healey, they share one defining quality: “People who care more about animals than they do themselves.”The show’s method for assigning initial age estimates has not changed. It involves dressing the participant in her least flattering outfit, then taking her to a busy public area and inviting criticism from passersby. It is out of earshot, you would hope, but these guys don’t hold back. “Hair needs a good sorting out,” says one woman with a curl of the lip. “Looks a bit dowdy,” frowns another. “Her skin … I can see it’s old and saggy,” offers a man in an anorak. Surely, if a woman these days wants to hear what 100 mean strangers think of her face, hair and body she can just go on Twitter?On Twitter, though, you rarely get a load of new clothes, a great haircut and thousands of pounds’ worth of cosmetic treatments for your trouble. Evidently some women – and the participants are still predominantly female – judge this to be a fair trade-off. Perhaps it’s also lower risk than it was back when Hambleton-Jones juggled both presenting and styling, resulting in a few disasters that still live on in YouTube infamy. Now Healey hands over to Gemma Sheppard, a TV stylist in the Gok Wan tradition, who wears a cravat and dutifully employs the fashion singular, as in: “You are never too old for a dungaree.” Crucially, though, Sheppard can deliver a changing-room pep talk with a warmth that has often eluded her predecessors.So maybe the show has gained wisdom in lieu of wrinkles? Much is made of the fact that the cosmetic interventions are now nonsurgical (the dentist Dr Uchenna Okoye is the only survivor from the original run. She hasn’t aged a bit). But “nonsurgical” does not exclude all manner of injections, plumps and peels, not to mention credulous claims made for an algae face mask that should raise eyebrows (Botox allowing). At one point Sarah is semi-scolded by the cosmetic physician for being “very naturally expressive, and that’s what’s causing the lines”. Good tip there, ladies: if you want to stay forever young, simply avoid expressing any human emotion.When, eventually, the women get a good look at their new selves in a full-length mirror, both seem delighted, as well they might be. Sarah is a season-three Carrie Bradshaw (when she was straightening her hair and cheating on Aidan) crossed with a lesser-known Kardashian cousin she’s working it. Gail, meanwhile, has transformed into a luminous synthesis of Tilda Swinton and Grace Kelly. The effect is genuinely ethereal, until Healey brings us all crashing down to earth with the comment: “I can’t believe you’ve ever had your hand up a cow’s bottom!”Still, at the risk of sounding like an absurdly ego-boosting drunk girl in a nightclub toilet Gail, babes, you were beautiful just as you were! You too, Sarah! Some women aim to look flawless 247, others choose to invest their finite energies in their work, their families or their livestock. All of the above are fine. Sure, change out of the stained tracksuit if you are going somewhere fancy, but I believe anyone not currently in the throes of a severe mood disorder would do so anyway.Maybe Gail and Sarah are depressed? Maybe some underlying trauma has burdened them with more than the usual share of niggling insecurities. But then, we wouldn’t know, because 10 Years Younger’s stuck-in-the-2000s, “looking good  feeling good” philosophy prevents any more useful conversations from taking place.

Their story is part of a growing trendBefore Qiguang Li could pass through customs and step on to US soil for the first time, he faced a three-hour detention where he learned that he needed to be more candid about his identity. It was September 2015, after a long flight from Shanghai to Los Angeles. Li came with another man, Wei Xu, who asked a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer whether the two of them could go through the border screening together. “What’s your relationship?” asked the officer. They said they were friends. “Then you can’t.”So Xu went first and passed the screening. He forgot one important thing, though: Li’s travel documents were in Xu’s bag. Li, 37 at the time, spoke poorer English and couldn’t properly explain to the officer what had happened. After a while of anxious waiting, Xu returned to the checkpoint to look for Li, still unaware of his mistake, and they were both sent to a room for additional screening.In the secondary screening room – commonly referred to by Chinese travelers as the “small dark room” – Xu and Li waited almost three hours, believing that they would be denied entry. An officer asked them why one’s documents were in the hands of the other. Xu kept explaining that they were very close friends, until at one point the officer asked: “Are you two partners?”And then everything changed. Xu learned that if they had said they were partners from the beginning, they would have been allowed to go through border control together, avoiding all the drama. “But we felt kind of ashamed to say that,” he recalls.The unexpected incident was the prelude to a carefully planned trip into another country where their sexuality was much more accepted than at home. There were a few other things they didn’t mention to the CBP officers. Li and Xu, a gay couple who have been together since 2007, would walk out of the airport, get married two days later in Los Angeles, and, more important, start their journey toward parenthood.From 2015 to 2018, Li and Xu made four transpacific trips as part of their gestational surrogacy processes. They traveled nearly 50,000 miles, spent more than $200,000, and went through countless days of distress, all to fulfill the dream of having their own family.An increasing number of Chinese gay men, like Li and Xu, are traveling thousands of miles and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue a dream that is impossible at home. Like Li and Xu, many of them refer to their surrogacy process as their “journey”.Xu and Li met in Shanghai on 15 November 2007. They had both grown up in rural China before moving to big cities. They’d chatted online and had a few phone calls, but when they met in person, it was love at first sight. By 2014 they owned two properties together and had just started a small business, a dry cleaners in Shanghai. Because gay couples are not allowed to marry or adopt in China, they started thinking about surrogacy. Li was 36 Xu had just turned 30.For this story, I spoke to a dozen gay Chinese men who have begun or completed surrogacy in the United States. Almost all of them started considering it between the ages of 30 and 40, and they often discussed how one needs to be extremely devoted to the idea of having his own child before embarking on the lengthy and often excruciating surrogacy journey. But they also often mentioned mianzi, the nuanced Chinese concept that literally translates to “face” but also means social standing and dignity. Li says that for many gay men, the strong push for babies comes from the elder generation. The social and cultural norm in China, inherited from thousands of years of patriarchal traditions, is that having a descendant of your own blood is necessary for a good life. Although this idea is under fierce attack from some in China’s younger generation, it still resonates with many young Chinese people, including some gay men who are asked, or volunteer, to have a child to protect the mianzi of their parents and themselves.For some of the parents, that means going as far as pushing their sons into the surrogacy journey. David Wang, a single, gay man of 28, living in the south-western province of Sichuan, says it took years for his parents to accept his sexuality after he came out in 2013. But once they had, his parents offered to pay for all of the expenses of surrogacy – if he would start as soon as possible.“My parents’ main argument was that they don’t want me to end up ageing alone,” says Wang, who was single and hesitant at the time. He eventually acceded to his parents’ wishes and made it through the bumpy surrogacy journey as a single father. In February 2019, Wang and his mother flew to Atlanta to be at the birth of his son and take him back home.Dr Guy Ringler, a physician with California Fertility Partners, tours in China to give medical consultations about surrogacy. His patients include one of the country’s most influential gay figures, Ma Baoli, founder of the world’s biggest gay dating app, Blued.“I have several patients who told me that they came out to their parents after their baby was born,” says Ringler, who is a gay dad through surrogacy himself. “And they said that it was so much easier because the parents don’t care any more. Because they have grandchildren, it’s not that big of a deal anymore.”Xu and Li were in a similar situation. Li has a brother, which significantly eased his pressure from the family Xu doesn’t, so they made the decision that their first child would be Xu’s biological son.Xu didn’t come out to his parents until midway through the surrogacy process, when, after two trips to the United States, he felt unable to conceal it anymore. It was a smooth coming out. The parents soon joined the excitement over a prospective baby. The couple’s decision to have a child became the tie between two generations.Surrogacy was still a total mystery to most of the Chinese gay community when Xu and Li started their journey in 2014. None of their friends had done it. There was no guidance about what to do. The only thing Xu could find was one personal-experience post online. He reached out with some questions, but the author disappeared after a few messages.Xu took responsibility for researching everything they needed to do. In January 2015, eight months before he and Li were awkwardly detained by US customs, Xu went on a lonely trip to America to learn from scratch, with no knowledge about surrogacy except for the name and address of a Chinese American fertility doctor in California.In the five years since Xu and Li’s journey began, information about surrogacy has become easily accessible in China. Despite the censorship of words like “surrogacy” – which is officially banned in China, although the law isn’t always strictly enforced – low-profile sharing and guidance flourish in online forums. Commercial ads for assisted reproductive technology have grown into a major sponsorship source for local LGBTQ+ organizations and apps. On the Chinese messaging app WeChat, groups for gay dads and future dads have mushroomed. Xu and Li joined the first such group chat in 2016, which has a self-explanatory name: “Group for Dads of American Babies”. In 2019, the group had more than 100 members, to whom more than 10 babies were born that year.Several American surrogacy agencies and fertility clinics told me that they’d seen a surge in Chinese clients, starting in around 2013, with gay people making up a significant portion of the clientele. The number of Chinese clients at the Fertility Center of Las Vegas “exploded” in 2013, according to Joanne Zhou, the center’s director of China operations: “Before that, we would only have a few Chinese clients annually, but from then on, we had double digits of them every month.”“Economic development in China … has created a number of middle-class people, including those who are homosexual,” observes Zhijun Hu, who, under the noted alias “Ah Qiang”, has been working as an LGBTQ+ activist in China for more than 20 years. “This group of people has brought about a strong demand for babies.”The demand has lured many American agencies and clinics to expand their outreach to China through more advertisements and offline consultations. It has also created a new Chinese domestic market that specifically helps to connect the LGBTQ+ community to resources in the United States. Intermediary companies, many founded by the early surrogacy clients, provide packages of services, including everything from translation to references for attorneys and nannies. Having an American baby through surrogacy has now become a popular and accessible life goal for urban gay men in China.The day after they made it through customs, Xu and Li went to the HRC Fertility Clinic Pasadena center for sperm collection. At the time, they already had an egg donor in mind and were working on the legal contract.Surrogacy usually involves both a surrogate mother and a different egg donor. The sperm and egg are collected, the egg is fertilized, then the embryo is transferred into the surrogate’s uterus. The egg donor is sometimes referred to by Chinese intended parents as luanmei, or “egg girl”, though the term is now seen as derogatory by some. To match with an egg donor, intended parents choose from a database of profiles, which list the donor’s age, race, medical history, education and much more.According to several surrogacy agency staff and fertility doctors, straight Chinese couples are often strict about finding Asian egg donors, since many of them wish to pretend that the baby has been conceived naturally. Most gay couples don’t have this concern and, sometimes, even like the idea of having mixed-race babies, whose looks are often appreciated in China. Being flexible on race also means significantly less waiting time and cost, because the demand for Asian egg donors in the United States far outnumbers the supply.Xu and Li signed a contract with a Latina donor who was attending college and has dark hair and dark eyes – in their words, “less westerner-looking features”. They met her in person on their 2015 California trip. In January 2016, 28 eggs were retrieved from the donor, and 17 were successfully fertilized. Thirteen of the 17 embryos, referred to as “semifinalists”, survived into their fifth day in the lab and were given a genetic test. Eight healthy embryos passed the test. They hoped that one of these “finalists” would become their baby.The genetic testing, expensive but optional, not only enables parents to prevent implanting embryos with higher likelihoods of having genetic diseases it also allows them to foresee the gender.Gender selection, though legal in the United States, is banned in China, where gender-based discrimination and the troubled history of the one-child policy have resulted in an absurdly unbalanced sex ratio at birth. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, China has a female-to-male sex ratio at birth of 0.885 – for every 1,000 male newborns, there are only 885 females – ranking last among all 153 countries studied.Many US agencies and clinics confirm that gay Chinese intended parents have a noticeable preference for sons, though some note that they see the same preference across gay men of all nationalities.Xu wanted a son. The genetic testing reported that he had five male embryos to choose from among the eight healthy ones. It also told him that he had two “super embryos” that rated 6AA in HRC Fertility’s system, indicating the highest success rate for transfer. It seemed like there were plenty of good options, considering that they only needed one. But the couple would soon learn that high-quality embryos were not always enough.In September 2016, their chosen embryo was transferred to the surrogate. They received the good news 12 days later that the implantation was successful.Another week later, different news came: it was a biochemical pregnancy – a very early miscarriage, before the embryo grew large enough to be seen via ultrasound. Two men with little knowledge about women’s health, they had learned this term only several months earlier when the agency told them that their surrogate had already had one recent biochemical pregnancy. It was an accident, the agency told them, and would not affect the mother’s health or her ability to carry their child. But now Xu and Li were nervous and wavering. Should they continue with a surrogate who’d now had two miscarriages?They decided to give it another try. On 2 December 2016, the second embryo was successfully transferred. Everything looked good in the weeks that followed. One morning seven weeks later, however, Xu received an email from the clinic: the surrogate mom had just gone to a regular examination, and no fetal heartbeat could be detected.Li was devastated. He couldn’t focus on work when he was at the dry cleaners’. How could this happen to them again, he kept thinking: was it because the surrogate was too old? Was it because she hadn’t taken as much care as the Chinese tradition requires?Two of their “super embryos” were gone. They decided not to work with the surrogate again, and went back to searching the surrogate database.Xu and Li spent a full year looking through surrogate profiles and trying to match with an ideal one. Xu would refresh the online database two or three times a week to check whether a new surrogate had been added. Some made it clear in their profiles that they didn’t wish to carry a baby for Asian parents or same-sex parents. Most didn’t live in California, the only state Xu and Li had been to at that time, but they decided not to limit their options to one state. Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania: “For a year we just flipped through their profiles and studied the American map, from the west coast to the east coast,” says Xu.In the US, legal regulation of surrogacy varies by state. About 10 states, including California, have either clear statutes permitting surrogacy or a history of favorable court orders. New York and Michigan forbid any form of compensated surrogacy, while Louisiana only permits it for married heterosexual couples. The majority of states fall somewhere in between, with no law specifically prohibiting surrogacy. Agencies require surrogates to live in the more friendly states and deliver the baby there to avoid legal troubles.Three times, Xu and Li made up their mind and chose a potential surrogate after speaking with her via video, but then she didn’t pass the screenings. A woman in Denver was tested and her uterine lining was found to be too thick a 19-year-old was excluded because the nurse doubted whether she could handle the responsibility at such a young age a woman in Kansas tested positive for chlamydia, the second time in her medical history, posing a threat of repeated occurrences. Their fourth choice, an Atlanta woman, made it past all of the medical and psychological screenings only to get cold feet at the last minute.Ann Yous had never considered surrogacy. A woman of Latin American and African-American descent in her early 30s, Ann (who asked me not to use her real name in this article to protect her privacy) lives in San Diego with her husband – a navy officer – and five kids.Then, at a holiday gathering, Ann was chatting with an acquaintance who had recently given birth. Ann asked how the child was doing. “Oh, it’s a baby girl,” the woman replied. “She’s fine. She’s in China.”“What do you mean she’s in China?” asked Ann.“It wasn’t mine. I was a surrogate.”At the time, Ann was pregnant with her fifth child. She had lost her parents at a very young age and didn’t have any siblings. She’d always wanted a big family and still loved the feeling of being pregnant. After a little research about surrogacy, Ann told her husband that she wanted to become a surrogate to help unfortunate families. “You are kidding,” he responded. “No, I’m really serious,” Ann said. “It’s easy for me to have one. What if I were to give that gift to someone?”She went through the routine of becoming a surrogate: a psychological questionnaire with tons of yes-or-no questions two different physicians combing through her medical history. One day in late 2017, Ann was told by the agency that she had been matched with a same-sex couple in China. She downloaded WeChat. In an hour-long video chat, Ann met Xu and Li for the first time.The first meeting was a back-and-forth of questions between Ann and the couple. They asked her about her daily life and her job, and she asked them about what their journey had been like so far. “I just wanted to see if they were talkative, or, if they were, you know, happy people,” recalls Ann. “They are. They are very warm.”The couple seemed a little shy to her, but Ann also found that they could easily get her jokes. Xu and Li liked Ann a lot too. They soon started to talk every day on WeChat.In February 2018, she successfully completed the embryo transfer, a five-minute process that, as she viewed it on the monitor, Ann compared to the flash of a firework. She kept messaging the couple about her medical visits. Then one day, she sent them a recording of the fetal heartbeat.When the pregnancy reached three months, Xu and Li flew to San Diego to meet Ann and her family. This was May 2018, their third trip to the United States, after two years of struggle and disappointment.Ann took them to a 4D ultrasound screening, where the couple got to see their future baby for the first time. The fetus was moving inside Ann’s womb, not much bigger than a peanut, but the head and limbs were discernible. They went to Ann’s house the next day and met her two youngest children. It looked so nice to have a big family, Xu thought. If it weren’t so expensive to have a child through surrogacy, they would consider another one.Xu estimates that he spent $30,000 more than expected before he met Ann. The miscarriages, the surrogates who backed out at the last minute, all of those costs were paid by the intended parents. At the time, Xu didn’t know that he would also be spending a lot more after his son was born, including a $6,000 bill on phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, because the baby didn’t have medical insurance. There are only a few insurance options for surrogacy newborns, and even fewer for those with international parents, and they can come with deductibles as high as $40,000. In the end, Xu and Li spent about $200,000 in total. The high cost of surrogacy means that it remains an option only for the privileged in China.As the delivery date approached, Ann knew that this would be a new experience. Her five children’s births had all been easy. But Xu’s baby was much larger, weighing almost 9lb at birth.On Friday 12 October 2018, Ann was admitted to the hospital after being told the day before that her vitals were too high and she needed an induced labor. Xu and Li, having arrived in San Diego three weeks earlier, went with her. Ann was given an epidural on Saturday morning, but things turned scary that night. “My water never broke, so they had to do it manually. And my vitals had dropped. I was in extreme pain,” she recalls. “That’s when I suggested, ‘Are we going to have a C-section?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, you are probably looking toward that.’ I said, ‘OK, can we let Xu and Li know?’”At 4 o’clock on Sunday morning, the baby was born. A nurse took the newborn to another room to meet Xu and Li, who had been at the hospital for 48 hours. Three years of planning hadn’t prepared them for this moment. The baby was paler and smaller than Xu expected. “He still looked so tiny,” he says. Xu and Li marveled at the newborn’s cone-shaped head and tried to determine if they saw any resemblance to Xu.When Ann came out of the delivery room a few hours later, they were waiting at the door to show her the baby. “I was very happy to see Xu and Li’s faces,” she remembers. “I know I was able to give them my gift they have so longed for. You could see in their eyes.” Three months earlier, the couple had invited her to think of an English name for the newborn. Ann named him Diego, as in San Diego, the city where they met and where the baby was born.Xu and Li took on different roles after the birth. Li looked after Diego at their rented San Diego apartment, while Xu drove around to apply for all of the legal documents they needed to bring the baby home.One month later, they flew back to China with the baby. They had sold their dry-cleaning business so that they could both stay at home and attend to the baby, and they moved back to Nantong, a smaller harbor city where Xu’s parents lived. There, they were able to afford a bigger apartment, where Diego would have more space to play, and it would be easier for the grandparents to help take care of him. Xu’s parents are overjoyed with their grandson, always asking Xu and Li to send Diego over and let Grandpa and Grandma take care of him.Another reason for their move is the cheaper cost of attending dual-language private schools in Nantong. Diego automatically obtained US citizenship, and Xu wants him to learn English in case he wants to go back at some point in his life.They consult with other gay dads about how to look after and educate a child. In the Group for Dads of American Babies chat group, they ask questions about practical things like supplements and discuss the challenges of parenting, which is still generally viewed as a woman’s duty in China.Ted Zhou, a member of the chat group who is expecting his baby to be born through surrogacy in 2020, says that most gay Chinese parents are particularly eager for information about how to parent. “An overwhelming number of Chinese dads don’t know how to parent. But in a family setting like this, you cannot avoid the responsibility.”Xu and Li still have daily conversations with Ann. Because of the cesarean and other complications during the delivery, her doctor doesn’t recommend surrogacy ever again. But she is happy to have been able to help Li and Xu on their journey. On Diego’s first birthday, Ann sent them a package full of baby clothes and toys.Diego learned to walk recently. With each passing day, he is getting more energetic and more adventurous, toddling around at home and grabbing the dog food to take a bite. Li often feels the burnout as a 40-year-old new dad: “When he takes an afternoon nap, I have to take one too. Otherwise … I just don’t have the energy to deal with him eight hours straight before he goes to bed.”Li and Xu once wanted two children, but they don’t know whether they want to repeat all of the effort, the thousands of miles of transpacific trips, not to mention spending another $200,000. “But if our conditions permit a second child,” says Xu, “we might consider a girl.”This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

The WHO said Africa’s “fragile health systems” also meant the threat posed by the virus “is considerable”.Egypt had the first case of Covid-19 in Africa, announced on 14 February. Algeria declared it had a case on Tuesday, an Italian adult who arrived in the country on 17 February. That prompted the WHO’s regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, to warn that the “window of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing.”Her warning was reiterated by the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Thursday, who said the epidemic was at a “decisive point globally” and that it could “get out of control” if affected countries did not move swiftly to contain it.“It’s what’s happening in the rest of the world that’s now our greatest concern,” he said.“The coronavirus now looks like a pandemic. Markets can cope even if there is big risk as long as we can see the end of the tunnel,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “But at the moment, no one can tell how long this will last and how severe it will get.”Others warned that the virus’s impact would also outstrip the impact of the US-China trade war, while Expectations the US federal reserve would cut interest rates to cushion the blow are rising in money markets.Donald Trump struck an upbeat tone for a second day running on the virus, saying on Thursday night that US agencies were doing a “fine job” and in the US and China, cases of Covid-19 were going down.But where the Dow led, Asian markets followed, with markets in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea all posting heavy losses.Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to protect the economy.“But I’m aware of views that if the virus spreads, it could have a huge impact on the economy,” Abe told parliament. “If developments change, we’ll ensure to take steps as needed to prevent the virus from becoming a huge downside risk to Japan’s economy.”In London, investors feared another fall on the leading FTSE100 index, as England’s chief medical officer warned on Thursday it was “just a matter of time” until coronavirus spread in the UK.

I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Friday.Fears that the coronavirus outbreak will be officially declared a global pandemic have grown after the first case was confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria’s health ministry said the case was found in Lagos, one of Africa’s biggest cities, with a population of 20 million people. Africa has recorded only two cases up to now, one in Algeria and one in Egypt. The spread of contagion to countries with poor public health systems has alarmed the World Health Organization, which said it could “get out of control”. The news was also greeted by financial markets as another sign that attempts to contain the virus have failed. Shares in Asia Pacific were hammered for the fifth day running and world stock markets are on course for their worst week since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008.In the UK, schools and offices could shut for months if a pandemic takes hold, according to the chief medical officer, while government and NHS documents show England only has 15 specialist beds for severe respiratory cases. The risk of large public gatherings is also threatening sporting events. Two leading cyclists, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish, are among riders who will be tested for the coronavirus after the UAE Tour was cancelled when two participants contracted Covid-19. But Uefa has insisted that the European Football Championship will kick off in Rome as planned in June.

Starmer dismissed her claims as “nonsense” and said he spoke out on the issue.Syria flashpoint – Dozens of Turkish troops have been killed in a bombing raid by pro-Syrian government forces in Idlib, ratcheting up tensions in the war-torn country. Turkish officials said 33 military personnel died in the airstrike on Thursday night while sources among the factions fighting in the area near the Turkey-Syria border said the deaths followed a precision strike on a two-storey building in the village of Balioun. Turkey supports rebels fighting the Syrian regime but that has pitted them against Russian forces who have fought alongside Syrian government troops in a ferocious three-month long assault on Idlib.Home alone – Priti Patel, the home secretary, has become embroiled in another controversy about her relations with officials after it was reported that she tried to oust the Home Office communications chief.

He was instrumental in the introduction of the 320km (200-mile) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) regime, which gave Pacific countries greater control over fishing in their waters.“I don’t know of anyone who has done more to really influence and shape our oceans and fisheries in a way that reaches into the pockets and homes of Pacific Islanders than the late Ambassador Nandan,” said Transform Aqorau, the former deputy director-general of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and now Solomon Islands representative to the UN.Nandan was the first secretary-general of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the UN body set up to manage all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area, a position he held for 12 years until 2008. Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said Nandan was a “titan of diplomacy”.“Satya’s legacy is tied directly to Fiji’s independent history. He will be remembered as a true global citizen, a wise mentor, and a proud son of the Pacific,” Bainimarama tweeted.A Fiji-born Indian, Nandan held a law degree from the University of London and worked as a barrister in London’s Lincoln’s Inn. He also served as Fiji’s Ambassador to the European Union, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (1976-1980) and as secretary for foreign affairs of Fiji.Nandan helped draft the 1976 Forum Leaders Declaration on the Law of the Sea which ultimately led to the establishment of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency in 1979.His fight for the exclusive economic zone benefitted island countries enormously, said Aqorau: “The tuna industries that we have in the region, the jobs that people have working in this industry and all the financial revenues that our governments now enjoy may be traced back to the efforts that he made for us in the United Nations.”Michael Lodge, the secretary general of ISA, said Nandan’s “inspirational presence, his wisdom, and his softly-spoken style of finding solutions through dialogue, will be deeply missed by all his colleagues and friends”. Nandan was accorded the rank of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1978 and was awarded Fiji’s highest honour, Companion of the Order of Fiji (CF), in 1997.Born in 1936 and was the youngest of 10 children of Shiu and Raj Kaur Nandan of Samabula Suva. He was married to another Fijian diplomat, the late Shree Nandan and later to prominent journalist, Zarine Nandan who died two years ago. He is survived by his only son Kumar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78c31b44912c934a46f8cfde703e30303d6b5e8/0_173_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20e42a86343bc0e2a9ca728e7fb19dd3","title":"red pandas are actually two separate species study finds","story":"Scientists found substantial ergences between Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas in three genetic markers Red pandas, the bushy-tailed and russet-furred mammals that dwell in Asia’s high forests, are not a single species but rather two distinct ones, according to the most comprehensive genetic study to date on these endangered animals.Scientists said on Wednesday they found substantial ergences between the two species – Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas – in three genetic markers in an analysis of DNA from 65 of the animals.The recognition of the existence of two separate species could help guide conservation efforts for a mammal as its numbers dwindle in the wild, they added.Chinese red pandas are found in northern Myanmar as well as south-eastern Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China, while Himalayan red pandas are native to Nepal, India, Bhutan and southern Tibet in China, the researchers said.International experts have estimated a total population of roughly 10,000 red pandas in the wild.“To conserve the genetic uniqueness of the two species, we should avoid their interbreeding in captivity,” said Chinese Academy of Sciences conservation biologist Yibo Hu, who along with colleague Fuwen Wei led the study published in the journal Science Advances. “Interbreeding between species may harm the genetic adaptations already established for their local habitat environment.“Scientists previously recognised red pandas as ided into two subspecies. While it had been proposed that these were separate species, the new study was the first to provide the genetic data necessary to allow such a judgment.The Himalayan red panda is the scarcer of the two and needs urgent protection because of low genetic ersity and small population size, Hu said. The Yalu Zangbu River most likely marks the geographical boundary separating the two species, not the Nujiang river as previously believed, Hu added.The two species also differ in coloration and skull shape.“The Himalayan red panda has more white on the face, while the face coat color of the Chinese red panda is redder with less white on it. The tail rings of the Chinese red panda are more distinct than those of the Himalayan red panda, with the dark rings being more dark red and the pale rings being more whitish,” Hu said.Slightly bigger than a domestic cat, red pandas have thick fur, a short snout and pointed ears, spending much of their life in trees and dining mostly on bamboo. Major threats to red pandas include deforestation and degradation of their habitat due to human development.Despite similar names, red pandas and giant pandas are not closely related. Giant pandas are one of the world’s eight bear species.Red pandas, with no close living relatives, are sometimes called living fossils as the only remaining member of the Ailuridae mammalian family. They are probably most closely related to a group that includes weasels, raccoons and skunks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0d303c81d0ee743a015b2d32aebeb914ea8f4f/0_598_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd283c8e258de5fdf4d7f74c2054add","title":"coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update","story":"New Zealand and Lithuania also report first cases as WHO says epidemic could get ‘out of control’. Follow live newsAfter President Emmanuel Macron’s warning on Thursday that France was on the brink of a coronavirus epidemic, officials there have announced 20 new cases emerging in the past 24 hours. With a dozen cases centred in the Oise area of northern France, which has emerged as one of the most significant clusters, and where concern has homed in on connections to the 110 military air base in Creil. Although health minister Olivier Véran said France was not yet in an epidemic he said the country was prepared for one. Two other French citizens who had recently returned from a trip to Egypt were reported hospitalised in Dijon and Brest. Another inidual, in Annecy, had recently returned from northern Italy.Good morning from London.168 Britons remain confined to the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests were diagnosed with coronavirus. Sources told the PA news agency that around 50 of the Britons will be allowed to leave if they wish.The Minister of Health in Tenerife said around 130 guests from 11 different countries will be able to leave the hotel if they arrived on Monday, after infected guests had already left.Airline Jet2 has said it will not fly back any people who have been staying at the hotel until they have tested negative for the illness.We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for COVID-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus.I’ll be handing over to my colleagues in London shortly, but here’s a quick look at the latest developments.The bloodletting has ended – for now – in some key Asia Pacific markets. They’re still going in China and getting ready for heavy losses in Europe and the US.Belarus has reported its first coronavirus case, an Iranian student who arrived in the country from Azerbaijan last week, AFP reports.The health ministry said the patient was in a “satisfactory” condition.People the student had been in contact with since their arrival on 22 February had been placed in quarantine in the hospital for infectious diseases in the capital Minsk, it added in a statement.The ministry also said that there would now be health checks on anyone arriving in the country from Italy - the worst affected country in Europe - Iran and South Korea.Travellers from China were already subject to such controls.New Zealand heath and government authorities are detailing the country’s responses, and the inidual case which has been reported today.It’s a New Zealand citizen who recently returned from Iran, and they are improving.Public health will be contacting people who were in the same row, and the two rows ahead and behind the person on their final leg - a flight from Bali on 26 February.They’ll be required to self-isolate for 14 days, under regular communication with local public health.The chance of a community outbreak remains low.“The risk of this disease is being very well managed,” said health minister David Clark, adding that all protocols have been put in place.When they arrived back in New Zealand they traveled home in a private car and then called health workers when they began to feel unwell.“They followed all of the steps you’d hope would be followed,” said Clark. They tested negative twice before testing positive.New Zealand is the 48th country to identify a case of the virus, Clark said, although a widespread outbreak was still thought to be unlikely.Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield added: “We have been preparing for this for some weeks, and we are ready.”“A range of cross government groups are working together” and guided by the pandemic plan, said Clark. “We are well prepared because we’ve had time to be prepared.”Border restrictions have minimised the chance of further cases arriving.He said his main message to the community was for anyone concerned to ring the helpline number 0800 358 5453, use good handwashing hygiene and cough etiquette.We are expecting a press conference from New Zealand authorities shortly, on the case detected there.In the meantime we have a few more details from AFP.Health officials said the person, reportedly a woman aged in her 60s, was being treated in Auckland City Hospital, and they are “in an improving condition in isolation”.Officials said the person arrived in Auckland on Wednesday and family members went to the hospital after becoming concerned about the inidual’s condition.The officials urged any passengers on Wednesday’s final leg of the Emirates airline journey, which goes from Bali to Auckland, to contact authorities if they were concerned.However, authorities downplayed the risk to the public saying the situation was being well managed.“Although we have our first case of Covid-19, the chances of community outbreak remain low,” the statement said.AFP has written about the measures being taken in Beijing to control the spread of the virus, amid fears there could be a resurgence. There was a fresh cluster of cases this week, and two deaths reported on Friday.This week, Beijing authorities announced new rules in a bid to disperse crowds in the city of over twenty million people, including many migrant workers from other regions.Supermarkets must allow an average of two square metres per customer - a mandate which not only forces shops to track how many patrons enter, but also means shoppers have to wait outside once stores hit maximum capacity.To prevent crowds from gathering, Beijing authorities have also tightened admission into its parks, especially as spring approaches.After a spike of activity over the weekend, reported official news agency Xinhua on Tuesday, the city’s park authority has clamped down on the flow of visitors.Ten of the capital’s top parks, including the historic Summer Palace, will cap the number of visitors at any given time to 30 percent of their maximum capacity, said Xinhua.The Sacramento Bee is reporting three students living in dormitories at UC Davis has been placed in isolation after one showed “mild” symptoms of the virus.The student has a runny nose and a cough after potentially being exposed to someone with coronavirus, officials said. The inidual is in isolation at a home off campus. The two other iniduals in isolation are the student’s roommates and are not showing signs of the virus.Important info for New Zealanders who have traveled recently.Capital Economics says China’s economy will shrink in the first quarter of this year despite the slowdown in the number of new virus cases.Activity is still subdued in the world’s second-biggest economy, Capital says, and the impact on domestic demand and international supply chains will have a profound effect on the global outlook.The consultancy, which has a page monitoring economic activity in China which is open to the public, says:The extended disruption from efforts to contain COVID-19 means that China’s economy is already in the midst of the deepest contraction in at least two decades. And the potential hit to foreign demand and supply chains from the global spread of the virus risks dampening the subsequent recovery.Lithuania has reported its first case of the virus, in a woman who returned this week from a visit to Italy’s northern city of Verona.In a statement, the Lithuanian government said the woman had been isolated in hospital in the northern town of Siauliai following her return on Monday. She has been under observation since, and is showing only slight symptoms, with no elevated temperature at the moment, it added. There are also more details about the case in Nigeria, the first for sub-Saharan Africa, via Reuters.The country’s health minister Osagie Ehanire, said in a statement the case was an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and returned from Milan, Italy to Lagos on 25 February.His infection was confirmed by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, part of the Laboratory Network of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. “The patient is clinically stable, with no serious symptoms,” said the minister, adding that he was being treated at a hospital in the Lagos district of Yaba. “We have already started working to identify all the contacts of the patient, since he entered Nigeria,” said Ehanire.

But the slow travel movement – a seismic shift in the mindset of once-frenetic holidaymakers – is one trend that seems set to stay. Casting aside the need for Instagram likes and bucket list ticks, slow travel shows there’s more to holidaying than whistle-stop city tours and frantic red-eye flights. Instead, we want to take our time over things: the slow swoosh of a sun-drenched French boat trip a peaceful cycle through the tulip fields of Holland a rocky amble around the Irish coast. Recently, the movement has been strengthened even further, as the Swedish concept of flygskam, or “flight shame” – which encourages people to boycott air travel in order to lower carbon emissions – takes hold. Now, how we travel is almost more important than where we travel, which makes getting about by ferry one of the wisest travel choices you can make. Here are a few more reasons to take to the seas.It allows you to connect with your passionsThe allure of travelling at your own pace is that you can explore a country under your own steam, be that on two feet or two wheels. If you’re an avid cyclist, taking the ferry means you can bring your beloved metal steed along with you to any destination at no extra cost (bike-friendly Holland should do the trick). And there’s no stingy baggage allowance or cramped overhead lockers to contend with, so you can bring all the energy bars and extra pairs of lycra you wish.Your holiday starts onboardRather than being confined to a few (small, uncomfortable) inches of a plane seat, there’s plenty to explore on the ferry. Kick back in the lounge with a newspaper, hot drink, comfortable seating and panoramic views of seabirds coasting over the ocean waves. Meanwhile, brasseries, food courts and bars offer more than enough options to settle grumbling bellies. You’ll find just as much freedom when you arrive at your destination, and as soon as your feet touch new soil you’ll be ready for your adventure, whether that’s exploring higgledy-piggledy French flea markets or cycling around Northern Ireland’s magnificent Causeway Coast – with no heinous jet lag.There’s no airport stressRare is the person who can pass through an airport unscathed by the stress of monstrous check-in queues, frustrating security processes and baggage handlers who treat moving suitcases like an Olympic discus event. Travelling by ferry offers a more laid-back approach, with streamlined boarding processes and no-fuss logistics. Best of all? There are no pesky “surprise” buses waiting to take you and a hundred other angry passengers to the correct terminal either.The fun’s in the journeyThink of slow travel as exploring the places “in between” A and B. By taking things slowly and savouring the journey, we become part of a place for a short time, rather than just lurching frantically through it. The deck of a ferry, the bunk of a cabin, or a window with expansive sea views becomes your new viewpoint, and you can immerse yourself in landscapes – from tiny islands to craggy coastlines – that you would never see from 35,000ft up, giving you a new appreciation of the part of the world that you’re travelling through.It broadens your horizonsPerhaps you’ve always stuck to the UK for your annual camping trip – liking the familiarity of that bluebell wood you know so well, or the campsite you love so much. Travelling by ferry allows you to push your boundaries a bit further and explore destinations you might never have previously considered. Why not swap the forests of England for the seaside campsites of Belgium? Or pay a visit to the historic battlefields of Ypres? Because really, exploring the unfamiliar is what adventure is all about.It’s ready-made mindfulnessNot all of us have time for meditation and paddleboard yoga, but there is something wonderfully calming about just slowing down. Getting anywhere by ship – where brains are lulled by the slow chug of the engine and frazzled nerves are calmed by the sound of the ocean – is about as close to mindfulness as you can get while not wearing a fluffy robe. And if a sand-splattered dog walk on a sprawling beach sounds like your kind of mindfulness, pets (including cats and ferrets) are welcome on board many P\u0026ampO Ferries routes too.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe A highly critical report into the mandatory use of iPads in schools has found that students are frequently distracted by the devices and used them for gaming, shopping and social media instead of class-based work.The findings are contained in a report by a team of experts commissioned by Ratoath College, a 1,000-pupil school in Co Meath which recently decided to drop its iPad-only policy and reinstate the use of schoolbooks.The report, seen by The , is likely to be influential in shaping how other secondary schools incorporate technology in the classroom.“Distraction” is a key theme which emerged from the review, with teachers and parents reporting that monitoring iPad use in class was an ongoing challenge.“From the teachers’ perspective, many reported that when they are at the top of the classroom the student ability to switch from class-based work on iPads to recreational activities such as gaming, shopping and engaging with social media was a matter of concern,” the report states.It quotes one parent, who stated about her son: “He is totally distracted . . . no backup of books for him to study from. Can’t confiscate iPad . . . Wifi needed for my job full-time from home, therefore cannot switch it off.”It also found that an issue raised by teachers was parents messaging their children during classtime.In addition, students who were surveyed also cited distraction as an issue, with more than one-third of respondents stating it was a problem.The report’s authors note that the short time students spent on the online survey was “indicative of the distraction that the iPad affords”.While the survey typically took 15 minutes to complete, many students spent between three and five minutes on it.A small number of parents noted that they felt their children were enjoying use of the iPad and that it had enhanced their learning.The report also highlights poor access to digital resources and e-books on the devices.In many cases, it found that teachers were forced to hand out “copious amounts of photocopies and notes”.Also, it was often reported that the students’ only records of classwork were poor quality photographs they took of writing on the classroom whiteboard.The report endorses its findings by quoting international research, which has found that a “rapid , indiscriminate move away from paper is not without negative consequences”.Some parents reported that they ended up organising private grinds for their children in subjects where there was little appropriate digital content for children. The report quotes international research which backs this finding up, noting that while “printed texts afford numerous stable anchors for memorising, digital texts are much reduced in this respect”.Another concern highlighted in the report is the high cost of the devices, increased levels of screentime and conflict at home over digital curfews.On a more positive note, it found there were no flagged instances of cyberbullying associated with the devices or of access to “inappropriate content”.The “independent digital review group” issued its report to Ratoath College’s board of management last month.Among its recommendations are that first-year students should no longer be required to buy an iPad.In future, teaching and learning at the school should be based on a “blended approach” that involves textbooks and technology.The review group included Dr Ann Marcus Quinn, an expert in technical communication and instructional design at the University of Limerick former school principal Cora Dunne, and former Department of Education inspector Dr Carl Ó Dálaigh.The school had been at the centre of controversy following a vocal campaign by some parents who were concerned over the amount of time their children were spending on screens."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186677.1582841945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"orange weather alert issued as storm jorge set to batter ireland","story":"Drone footage captures the extent of flooding in Clonlara, Co Clare.

Photograph: iStock Counties Galway, Mayo, Clare and Kerry are covered by an orange wind alert from 6am on Saturday until 3am on Sunday. The forecaster says severe winds are expected during Saturday associated with the storm which is expected to bring gusts of up to 130kmh and an elevated risk of coastal flooding.The second orange wind warning for Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo is in place from midday on Saturday until 3am on Sunday. A status yellow rainfall warning is in place for Munster, Connacht and Donegal from midnight on Thursday until midnight on Saturday. Rainfall accumulations of up to 30mm are expected during Friday and Saturday generally but 40 to 50mm of rain could fall in parts of Kerry.There is “a continuing risk of flooding” due to already saturated ground and elevated river levels, the forecaster added. A fourth, yellow weather alert, for wind, is in place for Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford between 9am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. Gusts of up to 110kmh are expected during this period. An orange warning means there will be “infrequent and dangerous weather conditions which may pose a threat to life and property”. Met Éireann said: “Prepare yourself in an appropriate way depending on location and activity. All people and property in the affected areas can be significantly impacted. Check your activityevent and delay or cancel as appropriate.”The yellow warning indicates weather “that does not pose a threat to the general population but is potentially dangerous on a localised scale”.National emergency groupA meeting of the the national emergency co-ordination group will take place on Friday. It has been convened as a result of “the prolonged period of very wet weather, the flooding that has already occurred and the potential impact of Storm Jorge, due to hit Ireland this weekend”.Storm Jorge, named by the Spanish Met Office, will begin with a low pressure centre that will track just across the north of Ireland on Saturday.The Defence Forces was on standby on Thursday to provide more help in flooded areas, Cmdt James O’Hara told Midlands 103 radio station.“Our personnel have deployed in two primary regions. The first one was in Co Limerick near Castleconnell and the second one in the Carnakilla area of Co Westmeath.”A number of roads across the country were flooded on Thursday, with the west the worst affected. Train services on the Dublin to Sligo rail line, which has been impacted by flooding, were operating on Thursday with 20 minute delays after water levels dropped slightly on Wednesday.However, services between Gort and Athenry were suspended due to rising water levels, with bus transfers operating between the two locations.According to an Irish Rail spokesperson, the company has invested in significant work on the line in the Carrick-on-Shannon and Dromod area in recent years and had raised the line in the areas that are prone to flooding during adverse weather conditions. The line is also prone to flooding as it passes near Lough Owel on the outskirts of Mullingar.Senior engineer at Roscommon County Council Eugene Dwyer says that while water was still on the rise in the rivers, this was not at the same pace as earlier this week.However, concern is now turning to turloughs, where levels are steadily on the increase from ground water sources.The Department of Social Protection announced on Thursday that it was activating its humanitarian assistance scheme to support householders affected by the flooding.The scheme, which is administered by the Irish Red Cross, provides financial assistance to people who are not able to meet costs for essential needs immediately following flooding or severe weather events.Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said the scheme would contribute towards the cost of returning small businesses, sports clubs, and community and voluntary organisations to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock where relevant.The first stage of the scheme will see affected groups receive up to €5,000 depending on the scale of damage. If the cost of repairing damage caused by the floods exceeds €5,000, a second stage of support will be provided, according to the department. Total financial support will be capped at €20,000.The scheme does not provide a contribution to loss of earnings or loss of business.Minister of State for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief Kevin “Boxer” Moran has called for a farm recovery grant to assist farmers struggling with livestock issues and damage to farm buildings.“The UK government have launched a similar fund in recent days and I believe that we should do the same here,” said Mr Moran, who lost his seat in the general election. “Some €2 million has been made available by the UK government to support their farming community and I think that is something we need to look at here also.”Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187301.1582842300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus viruses don t recognise boundaries or borders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride (centre) with   Dr Philip Veal and Dr Miriam McCarthy:  “People who have had casual passing contact are not at high risk of contacting this virus.” Photograph: PacemakerThe first suspicion that Ireland had a case of coronavirus came shortly after 6pm on Thursday when the North’s Public Health Agency (PHA) released a note about a 7pm press conference for an “important update” on Covid-19.Despite the short notice, there was a big press attendance at the PHA’s office on Linenhall Street in central Belfast, where the chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, confirmed a patient had tested positive.He described the test as a “presumptive positive”, saying full confirmation would have to come after further tests at laboratories in England. There seemed little doubt that such confirmation would follow, however.Dr McBride confirmed too that the patient had flown from northern Italy into Dublin Airport and travelled onwards to Northern Ireland.It is understood the sufferer travelled north by public transport, but Dr McBride would make no such confirmation. Neither would he reveal if the patient a man or a woman, or what was his or her current condition.Pressed that it was surely in the public interest for the public to know who this patient might have been in contact with, as he or she made their way to an unspecified location for isolation treatment, Dr McBride – in the interests of “patient confidentiality” – would not be more forthcoming.Close contactPublic health officials were making strenuous efforts to contact all those who had been in close contact with the inidual.“People who have had casual passing contact are not at high risk of contacting this virus,” he said.Dr McBride described close contact as “closer than two metres for a period of time”.He said “viruses don’t recognise boundaries or borders”, while adding that his first responsibility as chief medical officer was to “ensure that we take steps, working with our colleagues in the public health industry, working with colleagues in the HSE in the Republic of Ireland, to protect the population”.While he was loath to provide much detail, he was anxious to try to provide assurances. He said: “There is ongoing co-operation and liaison between he respective public health bodies in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland so the public can take confidence that we are working in a collective way to ensure an appropriate and proportionate response.”He wanted to avoid causing unnecessary public concern and anxiety. He said “at this point in time” a “small number” of those in contact with the patient had been identified as at risk. “This is very much a very active contact tracing investigation,” he said.‘Global village’In terms of people flying into Ireland while potentially carrying the virus, Dr McBride said: “We’ve got to appreciate the degree of interconnectedness that there is across the world in terms of fast rail links, flights . . . You know, we are a global village.”And notwithstanding that interconnectedness, Dr McBride went back to the basics of explaining how to try to avoid the virus. He said: “We are urging people to follow the steps that we recommend for similar illnesses such as cold and flu – catch, bin it, kill it. “Always carry tissues to catch your cough or sneeze, dispose of the tissue as soon as possible after using it, and clean your hands as soon as you can as germs can spread to every surface you touch.”Dr McBride added: “Our advice to the public remains the same. Members of the public who have visited affected regions and have symptoms are advised to self-isolate at home and contact their GP in the first instance. Advice will then be given on next steps, including testing if required.”Containment continuesHe couldn’t say if coronavirus would become a pandemic. “That is a distinct possibility but it is by no means inevitable,” he said. In the meantime the work of “containment” would continue “to try to stop the virus in its tracks”.Dr Adrian Mairs, the PHA’s acting director of public health , also offered assurances, saying: “Northern Ireland has well-prepared and rigorously tested plans for dealing with infectious diseases, and these have been activated.“This will help ensure that the patient receives appropriate care, and the likelihood of spread is minimised. I would like to reassure the public that the risk to the wider population remains low,” he added.Meanwhile, two of Ireland’s leading professional cyclists, Sam Bennett and Eddie Dunbar, were being checked for the virus in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Thursday night, where they were riding the seven-stage UAE Tour. The cyclists had completed five stages and were set to race two more stages, on Friday and Saturday. However, as more cases of coronavirus were confirmed in UAE, it was decided the final two stages would not go ahead – an unprecedented move in cycling. Irish champion and Giro d’Italia triple-stage winner Bennett, from Carrick-on-Suir, Co Tipperary, and Banteer, Co Cork man Dunbar, who is a member of the world’s best professional squad Team Ineos, were being checked for the virus at their team hotels, as were all of the riders and staff on the race.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillFianna Fáil and the Green Party have discussed a potential revision of the Government’s National Development Plan (NDP) which commits to a multibillion-euro investment in road projects around the country. The Green Party has said it opposes a planned €6 billion investment in major roads as part of the NDP and that this money could instead be used on public transport and to meet environmental objectives. One source said both parties set out “different positions” on the issue but the need to revise the plan “to make it realistic” was also discussed. During the election campaign, Fianna Fáil promised to green-light several major road projects such as the M20 between Cork and Limerick and the A5 between Donegal and Derry. The Green Party, on the other hand, said during the campaign the proposed M20 project “makes no sense”. Speaking after talks with Fianna Fáil concluded on Thursday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the NDP would have to be reviewed. He said this would have to be done to meet the target of reducing emissions by 50 per cent in the coming years. Any scrapping of road projects could prove problematic for the larger parties who would likely come under pressure from their TDs and constituents. There was no agreement on the path forward in relation to the NDP and this seems unlikely to happen unless and until fuller negotiations on a programme for government take place. Further talksMr Ryan said the Green Party would enter into talks with Fine Gael on Monday and Tuesday and would then speak to the Social Democrats on Wednesday. Sinn Féin is also scheduling further talks with parties for next week, while a meeting between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on policy is also being arranged. Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil has denied changing its position on a rent freeze and said previous legal advice received by the party on the matter had not changed either. The party’s housing spokesman, Darragh O’Brien, said while the issue of a rent freeze was mentioned in discussions with the Green Party on Wednesday, there had been no change in the party’s position that such a freeze would be unconstitutional. Earlier reports on Thursday suggested Fianna Fáil was set to drop its opposition to the measure. “Our position has not changed on it. The legal advice that we got is the same as what we got a number of weeks before the election. There has been no change on that. What we are willing to do on many matters is to look at what others will say,” Mr O’Brien said. Rent freezeMr O’Brien said the “issue of rents and renters and how we can help renters” arose as part of that discussion and that “a rent freeze was mentioned”. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary said the party was keeping its grassroots involved in the negotiating process. A Fianna Fáil ardfheis would have to approve any programme for government with the Greens and Fine Gael, for example.“The most important work at the moment is that we have a policy platform that delivers for people. Once we put the policies in place, and if we get agreement on policies with various groups, then we approach the issue of dialogue with our members,” Mr Calleary said.There was speculation on Thursday night that a vote for the next taoiseach would happen next week, despite a decision by the Oireachtas business committee not to allow this go ahead due to a lack of progress in government-formation talks. A committee source said no request had yet been made for the vote to go ahead, but the committee may have to meet again in the coming days to discuss the matter afresh. Separately, the Labour Party has arranged five leadership hustings between the two contenders, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Alan Kelly. They will take place between March 2nd and March 21st.

Twelve of the party’s TDs lost their seats.An “inside” nomination requires the backing of four TDs andor Senators while iniduals can seek “outside” nominations from civic society organisations. Nominations for outside bodies closed on Monday while the deadline for inside nominations is next Monday.In Fianna Fáil, six of the 16 TDs who lost seeks are understood to be retiring from politics. They are Bobby Aylward of Carlow-Kilkenny Donegal’s Pat ‘The Cope’ Gallagher Eamonn Scanlon in Sligo-Leitrim John Brassil in Kerry John Curran in Dublin Mid-West and Frank O’Rourke in Kildare North.Three female former TDs who lost their seats have secured nominations - Fiona O’Loughlin of Kildare South, Lisa Chambers of Mayo and Margaret Murphy-O’Mahony of Cork South-West.Former Clare TD Timmy Dooley has also secured a nomination as has former Cork East TD Kevin O’Keeffe along with the last Dáil’s shortest serving TD Malcolm Byrne, who was elected in the Wexford byelection in November and served for just five sitting Dáil days.Former Meath West TD Shane Cassells, former Roscommon-Galway TD Eugene Murphy, Declan Breathnach in Louth and Pat Casey in Wicklow are also expected to receive inside nominations.More than 25 Fianna Fáil candidates have already been nominated on the outside panels but the party is confident that after a “fragmented” first-preference vote, the electorate will vote along party lines and they expect about 14 or 15 Seanad seats.Fine Gael policy is focused on gaining representation in areas where the party has no seats and candidates will be prioritised in those.A number of former TDs have already secured nominations including Government Chief Whip and Minister of State Sean Kyne who was appointed a Senator as a Taoiseach’s nominee following the election of Frankie Feighan to the Dáil.Former Carlow-Kilkenny TD Pat Deering is on the ticket and Noel Rock in Dublin North West is also expected to be nominated. Former Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell is also expected to be on the ticket.The electorate includes outgoing Senators, incoming TDs and all county and city councillors, a total electorate of just under 1,200.Unlike a Dáil election, Seanad candidates seek support from all over the country and have begun a frantic campaign to visit as many TDs, Senators and councillors as they can.One Fianna Fáil TD who served a term as a senator said that he had travelled around the country and canvassed every councillor in the party and visited as many Independents as he could and some of the smaller parties’ councillors.For the most part he said the electorate is very polite will listen to the pitch.He said it was very important to meet voters face to face, especially those in a candidate’s area and surrounding counties and “when you’re offered the ninth cup of tea don’t refuse it”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187687.1582873955!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus more countries report first cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmployees from a disinfection service company sanitize a subway station in Seoul, South Korea, on Friday.

Countries other than China are accounting for about three-quarters of new infections.An Italian man who arrived in Nigeria this week was confirmed as the first coronavirus case in Africa’s most populous country. And a person who returned on a flight from Iran became the first in New Zealand.While in eastern Europe, Belarus and Lithuania both reported their first cases.World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said all nations should prepare.“This virus has pandemic potential,” Mr Tedros said in Geneva on Thursday. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now.”Ratings agency Moody’s said a pandemic - usually taken to mean a disease spreading quickly in different places - would trigger global and US recessions in the first half of the year.Share prices were on track for the worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 as virus-related disruptions to international travel and supply chains fuelled fears of recession in the United States and the Euro zone.Asian stocks tracked a plunge on Wall Street, where the benchmark S\u0026ampP 500 index fell more than 4 per cent on Thursday, extending a rout that has sliced more than 10 per cent off of its closing peak on February 19th.“The coronavirus now looks like a pandemic. Markets can cope even if there is big risk as long as we can see the end of the tunnel,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“But at the moment, no one can tell how long this will last and how severe it will get.”‘Decisive’In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease known as Covid-19.US president Donald Trump’s administration was considering invoking special powers to expand production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters.In Europe, France’s number of reported cases doubled, Germany warned of an impending epidemic and Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East, announced tighter border controls.The death toll in Italy, Europe’s worst-hit country, rose to 17 and the number of people who tested positive for the illness increased by more than 200 to 655.Germany has about 45 cases, France about 38 and Spain 23, according to a Reuters count.Mr Tedros told reporters in Geneva that Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a “decisive point” in their efforts to prevent a wider outbreak.South Korea has the most cases outside China, and reported 256 new infections on Friday, bringing its total infections to 2,022.The head of the WHO’s emergency programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said Iran’s outbreak may be worse than realised. It has suffered the most deaths outside China - 26 from 245 reported cases.US intelligence agencies are monitoring the spread of coronavirus in Iran as well as India, where only a handful of cases of have been reported, sources said.Tokyo OlympicsJapan is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympics in July but Dr Ryan said discussions were being held with organisers about whether to go ahead.As of Friday, confirmed cases in Japan topped 200, with four deaths, excluding more than 700 cases and four more deaths from a quarantined cruise liner, Diamond Princess.Japan has told schools to close and said big gatherings should be scrapped or curtailed, while pledging the Games will go ahead.Tokyo Disneyland will be closed from Saturday to March 15th, its operator said, leaving all of Walt Disney Co’s theme parks in Asia temporarily shut.The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.California-based Facebook Inc said it would cancel its annual developer conference and Microsoft Corp withdrew from a gaming conference.Scientists warn that much remains unknown about the virus, which can lead to pneumonia, and say a vaccine could take up to 18 months to develop.Hong Kong quarantined a pet dog of a coronavirus patient after it showed “weak positive” results for the virus, even though it did not have symptoms. Further tests would be conducted.US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)director Robert Redfield said the agency was evaluating how long coronavirus could be infectious on surfaces.“On copper and steel its pretty typical, it’s pretty much about two hours,” Redfield told a House of Representatives hearing. “But I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it’s longer.” – Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Turkey will no longer stop refugees reaching EU, in move calibrated to win support for Idlib operationWomen still must obtain permission to marry, orce and seek shelter from domestic abuseErdogan says developments turning in Turkey\u0026rsquos favour as fighting heaps miseryHumanitarian catastrophe is playing out in face of attacks by Syrian and Russian forcesPresident Sisi leads procession, completing official rehabilitation of leader ousted in 2011Russian warplane-backed Syrian army fights Turkish troops close to M5 and Neirab villageFormer president (91) was jailed following 2011 popular uprising but freed in 2017Netanyahu threatens war despite impending election after two sides exchange fireEstimates suggest ruling reformists lose election following lowest turnout since 1979Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan says he will meet Putin, Merkel and Macron as Syrian government forces push to retake regionMany of senior conservatives are former supporters of Mahmoud AhmadinejadStuck between a closed border and Russian-backed forces, Syrians have nowhere to runPrime minister Netanyahu announces the settlement expansion 11 days before the Israeli electionBoth sides to sign agreement on February 29th if violent reduction period successfulErdogan\u0026rsquos policies have left Ankara isolated, with Moscow one of its most reliable partnersRussian warplanes strike rebel-held towns as Turkish military backs insurgent strikesErdogan, whose country has second-largest army in Nato, says \u0026lsquowe are making our final warnings\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoHistoric plan\u0026rsquo to extend high-speed train link to Western Wall criticised by archaeologistsRelief agencies overwhelmed by humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria, says UNUN says 875,000, mostly women and children, have fled heavy aerial bombing since December 1stStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: Everyone benefits when school children are taught to be polite, respectful and disciplinedThe creators of the hit ITV show Liar: \u0026#39We would never have made Laura the villain\u0026#39Airstrike kills 33 Turkish soldiers in Syria while Russia says troops were amongst \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39Ban phones and queue in silence for better GCSEs,Coronavirus latest news: Nigeria reports first case as outbreak spreads to sub-Saharan AfricaUK weather: Storm Jorge set to bring 70mph gales and up to 80mm of rain Rishi Sunak told by \u0026#39red wall\u0026#39 Conservative MPs to reverse EU directive that slapped a 700 per cent tax increase on motorhomesJapan in \u0026#39turmoil\u0026#39 over coronavirus plans amid panic over Tokyo OlympicsHong Kong arrests publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai over protests in AugustNew hybrid cars have higher carbon emissions, Which?

Because the trajectory is not stable, 2020 CD3 will eventually be flung away from the planet.The new moon is thought to be between 1.9 and 3.5 metres across.Kacper Wierxchos, a researcher at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, made the discovery with colleague Theodore Pruyne.He hailed the rare sighting as big news, tweeting: It\u0027s a big deal as, out of one million known asteroids, this is just the second asteroid known to orbit Earth.A spokesman for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\u0027s Minor Planet Center, which collects data on minor planets and asteroids, said: Orbit integrations indicate that this object is temporarily bound to the Earth.No link to a known artificial object has been found.

George Clooney, the Hollywood heart-throb and activist, has declared himself “surprised and saddened” by the revelation that Nespresso may have been using child labour.Clooney has been “global ambassador” for the coffee company for 14 years, and sits on its “sustainability advisory board”. But a Channel 4 investigation has found that children as young as 11 are working on some Guatemalan farms that may supply Nespresso.There is a particularly lip-smacking pleasure to be had from the exposure of hypocrisy – especially if the alleged hypocrite happens to be handsome, rich (Clooney is said to have earned £31m from his Nespresso contract alone) and prone to moralising.Why would a man with such a prominent social conscience get into bed with Nespresso in the first place? The company – owned by Nestle, of baby milk infamy – single-handedly reinvented coffee-making to introduce a new form of superfluous packaging. Less than a third of its single-use capsules ever make it to one of Nespresso’s specialist recycling centres. In the UK alone, around 350 million coffee pods go straight into landfill every year.“He does not believe who does not live according to his belief,” wrote the English cleric Thomas Fuller. If your deeds don’t match your words, you’re a hypocrite. Case closed. And yet, I feel for Clooney. Because I am a hypocrite myself, and so are you. Living virtuously – an arduous task under any circumstances – is next to impossible when everything you eat, drink, wear and do depends on the complex supply lines of global capitalism.What is it you care about? Climate change? Better stop eating free-range meat then. Factory-farmed chickens have a smaller carbon footprint than their free-range equivalents, because birds need less food when confined indoors. Likewise, a British cow – raised largely outdoors on picturesque pastures – has a nicer life but a bigger carbon footprint than its American cousin raised in a vast, dystopian feedlot system. Giving cows growth hormones, and feeding them on grain instead of grass, means they gain weight more quickly, live shorter lives and therefore have less opportunity to burp methane.Better go vegan then. But wait! That almond milk you’re about to slosh into your coffee (which you can’t be sure wasn’t harvested by pre-teens) will almost certainly have come from California’s almond plains. This vast, monocultural landscape, dripping with pesticides, has become a sort of killing fields for bees, billions of which are bussed in every winter to pollinate the almond trees. More bees die every year in the US than all fish and animals raised for slaughter combined.Every attempt at virtue collapses in on itself. That organic cotton bag-for-life you bought? You’d have to use it 20,000 times to make up for all the extra resources that went into making it. Boycotting palm oil to save the orangutans? Well, yes, but it produces more oil per hectare than any other plant. Whatever replaces it might lead to worse deforestation. Even the case against coffee capsules turns out to be complicated: they are extremely efficient at reducing coffee waste, and thus saving carbon.This is not an argument for consumer apathy only for humility. We can – must – try to live conscientiously. But perfect virtue is a delusion.

Three of his former students have told The  he was a predator who used his position to groom female pupils for sex.They have decided to speak out now because they say the MeToo movement has helped them realise that what they had previously characterised as a relationship with an erudite older man was actually a wholly abusive breach of trust on his part.They hope it will embolden other women in similar positions to speak out about abusive former teachers.One alleged victim, Kerry, said: He would have sex with us or sexually assault us in his office on the school premises.She was just 15 when they first had intercourse, she claimed, and said: He saw me flirting with boys and he was concerned I was going to lose my virginity, so he wanted to get in there first.Mr Wilkinson told The  he did not acknowledge any of the alleged relationships and said the allegations were turning into a nightmare for him, but that he had no further comment to make. I don\u0027t want to say anything … I have nothing to say about it. I\u0027m sorry, he said.According to his alleged victims, the grooming would start with him putting stickers on their locker, playing footsie under the desk or inappropriately placing a hand on a knee at the theatre.They claimed he would hold private study groups at his house, offer students lifts home and invite his favourites to use his school office. Some of the alleged relationships would last for years, the women have said.One former student, who claimed she first had sex with Mr Wilkinson when she was 16, said: I would have a relationship with him as a boyfriend … it was always at his house. We never went anywhere else because it was a secret.After the relationship ended, she said, she put it in a box and never really dealt with it.The three women claimed he went to great lengths to keep the relationships secret. Kerry said he even encouraged her to move to a different school to ensure that he was safe.But he still engineered situations in which they would be alone together, she said. He is alleged to have sexually assaulted her in his school office. He also offered her private tuition to get her into Cambridge (which she eventually did), charging her parents for two-hour lessons that were largely spent in bed, she claimed.Kerry alleged he seduced her by reciting poems about his lover\u0027s deep velvet amber eyes and her lips learning, yearning.She believed they were written for her, but said she later learnt she was not the only conquest to whom he recited them. He allegedly recycled the verses for another woman he started dating after she left school and would go on to marry and later orce.He also loved to discuss his favourite books, the notorious pornographic novel \u0027The Story Of O\u0027 and \u0027Lolita\u0027, Vladimir Nabokov\u0027s infamous tale of a middle-aged professor who believes he is seduced by an underage child, Kerry said. They were his manuals for living, she added.Enthralled by him, she did everything he asked, and alleged their abusive relationship continued until she was 18, by which point, she said, they\u0027d had sex hundreds and hundreds of times.Speaking from her home in Sydney, she described how he would ask her to pose for pornographic pictures and, she claimed, once borrowed a school video camera to film her naked. She was later humiliated to learn that his other lovers allegedly saw these pictures.But she was not the only one he was said to have slept with. He allegedly entered a sexual relationship with another student while he was abusing his position to have a relationship with Kerry.He was married to a fellow teacher, Susan Wilkinson, when he started teaching at the school. Ms Wilkinson left him after she became pregnant with his child, and he allegedly moved on to another colleague. Before the marriage disintegrated, one of the school\u0027s male teachers tried to warn Susan of Mr Wilkinson\u0027s behaviour, telling her that putting David in the sixth form is like putting him in a sweetshop.One other alleged victim recalled finding a trove of mementos: Polaroid photographs, letters and cards from girls who looked to be aged around 16. They were in their underwear – they weren\u0027t naked, but it was clear there was a sexual kind of scene to them, she said.Mr Wilkinson allegedly targeted very bright girls. The three who spoke to The  also admitted that they tended to come from difficult backgrounds. Some were still at school when the relationships began, they said. With others, Mr Wilkinson allegedly waited until after they completed their A-levels.According to the women, he would have sex with them at every opportunity.Kevin O\u0027Regan, who became head teacher in 1997, after Mr Wilkinson retired, recalled some hearsay about an incident with a sixth-former that had taken place before 1985 but had been told it had been dealt with.Mr Wilkinson was so adept at ensuring his behaviour was kept secret that head teachers in charge at the school for the near-quarter of a century he was there say they were entirely unaware of any alleged abuse.When approached by The , one former head said he remembered Mr Wilkinson as an excellent, brilliant teacher. He added: Nearly all the arts candidates who went to Oxbridge, and there were a number were taught by him and he was the reason they got in. He was one of the best teachers I ever came across. Very able.What was startling about Mr Wilkinson\u0027s alleged campaign of abuse was the complexity of the web of deceit it would involve.One woman, Lucy, claimed Mr Wilkinson initiated their sexual relationship in his car after a party at his house to celebrate the end of A-levels. She later learned that he went home after their encounter and allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with another of her classmates.Lucy returned to the school the following year to re-sit some exams. He was displeased but they carried on their affair regardless, she said.She believed that formative experience set a pattern for many of her subsequent relationships. She – and every other former student The  spoke to – wept as she recounted the impact it had on her life.I\u0027m not sure that our laws are sufficiently sophisticated at this point to understand the deep and profound ramifications of this kind of behaviour – that it is not only lifelong but also generational. What\u0027s happened to me has also affected my children in ways that are very hard to describe.Like Kerry, she spent most of her life oblivious to the possibility that she might have been one of a string of girls to have become involved, and believed Mr Wilkinson had singled her out early on because she was somehow special.It was only in the wake of the MeToo movement that they started to reappraise things – and the discomfort they felt crystallised into horror.Kerry added: I think of him as almost evil – as a Svengali character who used his charisma and all of the tools at his disposal, literature and poetry, for sinister ends, to get what he wanted.And I think of him as being narcissistic. Up until this whole process, I think I was still somewhat grateful to him for what I had seen as a positive impact on my life, but I now realise that any positive impact was overstated and came at a huge, huge price to me.The allegations have been reported to the police. But the women\u0027s stories do not necessarily account for all those whose lives he allegedly affected.One girl who rejected his advances – whether wittingly or unwittingly – was allegedly subjected to a campaign of bullying by the man supposed to be nurturing her.Hillary Hinchliff, who went on to have a successful career in education and became principal of a renowned school in India, wept as she recounted how Mr Wilkinson made her life hell after she turned down his offer of a key to his private office.At the end of the day, he\u0027s a sick inidual who should have been stopped, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean?

It may give rise to a further cycle of fearful selling.It could presage a 20 per cent decline in values, the definition of a “bear market”.More broadly, falling share prices matter in that many of us are invested in stock markets through our pension or other saving schemes.So when markets\u0026nbspfall, we are worse off.It’s estimated that more than $3 trillion of value has been lost from listed companies across the world this week.\u0026nbspHowever, providing we are not about to retire tomorrow we shareholders are only worse off on paper. Shares in the long term have tended to rise.Any other reason to be relaxed amid the market mayhem?Some analysts argue that major stock sell offs and corrections can be healthy if they bring an overheated market down to earth.“Stocks have moved upwards for many months without a significant correction — and there is a compelling argument to make that a correction is overdue,” says Kristina Hooper of Invesco.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was discovered in 2017, prompting frenzied speculation about what conditions might be like there. It was\u0026nbspthe subject of even more excitement towards the end of last year, when it became the first other planet discovered to have water vapour in its atmosphere.\u0026nbspThe latest study gives a look at what conditions could be like underneath that atmosphere. And it suggests life could be supported in just the way scientists had hoped.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsDr Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, who led the study, said: “Water vapour has been detected in the atmospheres of a number of exoplanets but, even if the planet is in the habitable zone, that doesn’t necessarily mean there are habitable conditions on the surface.“To establish the prospects for habitability, it is important to obtain a unified understanding of the interior and atmospheric conditions on the planet – in particular, whether liquid water can exist beneath the atmosphere.”Because of the size of K2-18b, some suggest it would be more like a smaller version of Neptune than a larger version of Earth.It is thought a mini-Neptune would have a significant hydrogen envelope surrounding a layer of high-pressure water, with an inner core of rock and iron.If this envelope is too thick, it would be too hot, and pressure at the surface of the water layer beneath would be far too great to support life.According to the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, despite the size of K2-18b, its hydrogen envelope is not necessarily too thick and the water layer could support life.Astronomers used the existing observations of the atmosphere, to confirm the atmosphere is hydrogen-rich with a significant amount of water vapour.They also found that levels of other chemicals such as methane and ammonia were lower than expected.But whether these levels can be attributed to biological processes remains to be seen.The researchers found that the maximum extent of the hydrogen envelope allowed by the data is around 6 per cent\u0026nbspof the planet’s mass. Most of the solutions require much less.The minimum amount of hydrogen is about one-millionth by mass, similar to the mass fraction of the Earth’s atmosphere.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Over 199 episodes, the series followed Ironside and his team in his role as consultant to the Police Department as they sorted out the bad guys of the City by the Bay.    Ian Rankin says he has never watched any of the television adaptions of his famously brooding, heavy drinking, loner detective because he didn’t want the actors’ faces replacing how he envisaged Rebus in his head. Two actors have played Rebus on screen, John Hannah and Ken Stott. Hannah gives the role his best but was probably too young and lacked the cynical gravitas that Stott gave to Rebus. With similar roles in The Vice and Messiah giving Stott an identifiable acting persona, he perhaps has the same problem as Humphrey Bogart being too much like Bogart to play the definitive Philip Marlowe, but in the absence of any other candidates, Stott is just fine. Rankin’s central theme of the Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy of Scotland’s capital city remains intact, and as in the novels, the real star of the show is of course, Edinburgh itself in all its historic beauty, showing the dark underbelly of the city behind the chintz curtains. 320 18. Life on Mars (2006-07)Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but the biggest mystery with Life on Mars is why it took someone so long to come up with this inspired paean to the pop culture and TV cop shows of the 1970s. Throw in the fish-out-of-water time travel motif and the tongue in cheek non-PC scripts and characters, and its not hard to see why the series struck a chord with audiences.    Like many of his ilk, dedicated near-genius DCI John Luther (a brilliant Idris Elba) is a tormented soul, struggling with his own inner demons, hugely affected by the stomach churning crimes he investigates. Luther is so obsessive that he will do anything to get his man (or woman, in the case of his nemesis, the psychopathic scientist Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) Both cerebral and heart pumping, Luther was created by Neil Cross and has spawned American and Russian versions.Gillian Anderson is the deliberate, dedicated senior detective on the trail of an equally meticulous serial killer in this controversial drama filmed and set in Northern Ireland. The Fall survived accusations of misogyny and voyeurism to lift a Bafta for best television drama and keep viewers hooked for three series, but remains a troubling, unsettling experience for many.620 15. Cagney and Lacey (1981-88)The cop show that more than any other blew the stereotypical image of female police officers out of the water, and challenged the sexist attitudes of many executives in the television industry. Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won the hearts of millions of viewers, and six Emmys between them, as two dedicated New York police officers who happened to be women with normal lives and challenges like everyone else. The bond between the two characters was unbreakable despite leading entirely different lives (Lacey was married with a family and supportive husband, Cagney drifted from relationship to relationship). A game changer in many ways, Cagney and Lacey explored issues such as rape, abortion and Cagney’s alcoholism head on.720 14. Between the Lines (1992-94)Set in the politan Police Complaints Investigation Bureau, the Bafta winning Between the Lines follows ambitious Chief Superintendent Tony Clarke and his team as they investigate corruption within the police force. Between the Lines drew praise for the way it tackled topical issues of the day as it attempted to address the age old moral dilemma, quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves?The cop show that more than any other blurred the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Rogue cop Vic Mackey leads the elite “strike force” of LA detectives who routinely break the law to keep the streets safe, but also to feather their own nest. There are subplots aplenty, and Mackey’s downfall plays out almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.Set in the fictional northern town of Newtown, Z Cars broke new ground in police drama shows, challenging the homely predictability of the likes of Dixon of Dock Green. Devised by Allan Prior and Troy Kennedy Martin, the series centred on not just one central protagonist, but rather several police officers both uniformed and plain clothed. Z Cars brought some iconic characters into the nation’s living rooms such as detective Charlie Barlow, PC “Fancy” Smith and desk sergeant Bert Lynch. The police officers themselves were portrayed warts and all, with gritty subject matter, including domestic abuse at the hands of a police officer, at the heart of the storylines. The actors became household names with the iconic theme tune whistled on everyone’s lips, and of course there were the “Z” cars themselves, the American-style Ford Zephyr and Zodiac patrol cars.   If Cagney and Lacey blazed the trail for female cops, then the first series of Prime Suspect in particular indicated a seismic shift in the perception of, and the attitudes towards, the female police officer. Helen Mirren is outstanding as DCI Jane Tennison who heads a murder squad hunting a sadistic serial killer, but has to overcome opposition and resentment from her team as well as the institutionalised sexism of the police department itself. Subsequent series concentrated more on Tennison’s inner demons as she began to rely on alcohol to help her cope with the pressures of the job.  This Danish police procedural and prime example of Scandinavian noir attracted criticism for its violence against women. It did, however, become an international success particularly in the UK. Viewers were gripped by the formula that of each episode reflecting 24 hours in the same murder case, and by the cold-fish female detective protagonist Sarah Lund, while developing an almost fetishist fascination with her knitwear. The Killing paved the way for other subtitled European crime dramas and equally popular and acclaimed entries such as The Bridge and Borgen quickly followed.     1220 9. Law and Order (1990-2010)Filmed in New City with a two-pronged approach of the investigation of a crime and arrest of a suspect, followed by the suspect’s trial, Law and Order introduced one of the great small-screen detectives, recovering alcoholic Lennie Briscoe. (Jerry Orbach). The show’s boast was that many of its subject matters were “ripped from the headlines” and it was this approach that gave it a compelling topical feel and made it the longest-running American crime series and the benchmark for police procedurals.1320 8. Line of Duty (2012- )An outstanding ratings success for BBC2, Jed Mercurio’s masterful police corruption thriller gripped viewers from the very beginning and kept them guessing until the explosive climax to the third series. The bold, serpentine and gripping storylines provided the exemplary cast with parts of a lifetime, with the most outstanding feature of Line of Duty undoubtedly the lengthy interrogation scenes as the tension was racked up notch by notch. After Bing Crosby turned the role down, Peter Falk became synonymous with the cigar smoking, dishevelled police lieutenant in a shabby raincoat, winning four Emmys and a Golden Globe. Referred to as a “howcatchem” by its’ creators, Columbo deviated from the traditional whodunit in that the audience and, it seemed, Columbo himself, knew the identity of the murderer from the start. Half the fun of the show was watching the murderer (frequently an A- or B-list guest star) underestimate the seemingly bumbling, absent-minded detective while he baited the trap to snare them. Oh, and just one more thing, as Columbo himself might say: although Columbo routinely spoke of his wife, she was never seen in any episode, but the character was later given her own, short-lived, spin-off show, Mrs Columbo. It has been compared to the works of Dickens and Dostoevsky and lauded as the greatest television programme ever. But the triumph of The Wire is how it tells the story of the decaying city of Baltimore through the lives of the police, drug dealers, politicians, children and the dispossessed, making no moral judgements between good and bad in a predominately grey world. The Wire may not be the greatest television programme ever, but its realism and authenticity can never be in doubt. In 2005, members of a drugs gang claimed they had studied The Wire in order to learn about the latest police surveillance techniques, surely the ultimate example of life imitating art. Aping its antecedent Hill Street Blues’ cinema verite style, multi award winning NYPD Blue was a natural progression for co-creator Steven Bochno, who along with David Milsch came up with even grittier storylines, atmospheric New York locations and warts ’n all characters to create a hugely compelling and influential cop show. But let’s be honest, despite a terrific ensemble cast, Dennis Franz as scenery-chewing recovering alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, was virtually the whole show, appearing in all 261 episodes and in the process searing his psyche in viewers’ minds.1720 4. Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-98)Baltimore native Barry Levinson was a natural fit as executive producer of this ultra-realistic police procedural, based on The Wire creator David Simon’s book chronicling his experiences following homicide detectives at work in the so-called “City of Firsts”. From the very first episode Life on the Street succeeded in dispelling the myths and stereotypes about the television cop, showing that murder and violence were just a routine parts of the job. Indeed the murder of a schoolgirl in that first episode was never solved. Aficionados rate this show even better than The Wire. Some have called Homicide: Life on the Street the missing link between Hill Street Blues and The Wire. Beg, borrow or steal the box set and find out why.   Such is the renown of the celebrated television adaptation of Colin Dexter’s novels featuring the enigmatic real-ale swilling, arts loving, crossword buff detective, that there’s very little left to say apart from it’s basically a brilliant variation on the classic English whodunit, Kevin Whately’s Lewis is to John Thaw’s Morse as Dr Watson was to Sherlock Holmes, and Thaw is simply wonderful.It has become so caricatured and parodied in recent years that it’s easy to overlook the fact that The Sweeney made Z Cars look as antiquated as the former did Dixon of Dock Green a decade earlier. Created by Ian Kennedy Martin, brother of Z Cars co-creator Troy, The Sweeney was shot in 16mm film and that, along with extensive location shooting, gave it a more cinematic look than other studio-bound rivals. Created by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll and still celebrated, still hugely influential, and still the cop show to which almost everything that has come since owes a huge debt. From Mike Post’s iconic theme and the innovative cinema vèritè-evoking handheld camera, to the brilliant ensemble cast creating beloved characters and dramatic storylines in the urban sprawl of an unnamed US city, Hill Street Blues pioneered a new wave of cop shows. Ironically, it never gained huge audience ratings, but garnered a grand total of 98 Emmy nominations. Groundbreaking, thought provoking, emotional and funny, Hill Street Blues stands tall in the canon of truly great television.Launched to much fanfare as a television movie and boasting a killer theme tune from Quincy Jones, Ironside starred Raymond Burr, who was still hot after his stint as television’s Perry Mason, as San Francisco Chief of Police Robert T Ironside, who is confined to a wheelchair after an attempted assassination.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

No matter what they do, they’re going to lose.”The second theory would involve setting The\u0026nbspMatrix 4\u0026nbspwithin the Matrix, but having it focus on different versions of Trinity and Neo.“This could be a Neo and Trinity who existed at a different point in the Matrix’s timeline ...and grew to middle age before finding out about the Matrix,” the Reddit user wrote.\u0026nbsp”This option feels less rich to me because it lacks a lot of what the first one brings but it could also allow us to explore these characters plus\u0026nbspthe Matrix in a brand new light.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They paid me £38 a week – you can’t live on that money. You need to buy food –\u0026nbspbreakfast lunch and dinner. Sometimes you have appointments so you need to pay for transport,” he said.“Sometimes I ran out and had to rely on friends. It was so, so stressful. And you don’t know what ‘s going to happen. You’re going to sign on every month with immigration, and you just don’t know what’s coming next.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You think too much you don’t sleep. It feels like wasted years.”The Congolese national waited two and a half years for an initial decision on his case, which was a refusal. He then appealed – a process which took around two years – and was granted asylum last year.“I gave them all the evidence. So much evidence. The reason they gave was so rubbish. It was very stressful going through the appeal process. I’m hopeful now that I can finally find a job and move on,” he said.Asylum seekers ‘should be allowed to work after six months’Majority of asylum seekers housed in disadvantaged areas, figures showAsylum seekers left destitute due to ‘failing’ Home Office contractUnder a bill brought forward in parliament earlier this month, asylum seekers who have waited more than six months for a decision on their claim would be given the right to work.The\u0026nbspSNP’s\u0026nbspCarol Monaghan\u0026nbspaccused the government of “wasting the talents of thousands of people” as she launched a commons bid to halve the wait for those seeking asylum to be allowed to work.Responding to the new figures, Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “Snowballing wait times combined with a ban on working has created a perfect storm for poverty and homelessness for people seeking asylum.“The government has a moral and legal obligation to prevent people seeking asylum from falling into destitution. They simply must lift the ban on people working.”Campaigners welcomed the fact more than half (52 per cent) of people who sought safety in Britain last year were granted protection at the initial decision stage, compared with only a third (33 per cent) the previous year.Andy Hewett, head of advocacy at the Refugee Council, celebrated that more correct decisions were\u0026nbspbeing made in the first instance, but said he was “deeply worried” more and more people seeking protection in Britain were being forced to wait for months and in some cases years for decisions.“It is unbearable to think about what life is like for these people, living in constant limbo and fear, ending up in poverty and being banned from finding work. It is unacceptable that in modern Britain so many human beings are being forced to survive with such a basic lack of dignity,” he added.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring asylum claims are considered without unnecessary delay and that those who need protection are granted as soon as possible, can start to integrate and rebuild their lives, including those granted at appeal.“Asylum seeker right to work is a complex issue and is under review. It is crucial we take the time to get this right. We are listening carefully to the arguments and considering the evidence put forward on the issue.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold.

Mr Sanders is predicted to win an average of 35 delegates from the state.\u0026nbspMinnesota – Senator Amy Klobuchar’s home state – has 75 pledged delegates, including 10 superdelegates.

Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter\u0026nbspthat this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers.\u0026nbsp“I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.I am just very sad for the situation my family is now inBut she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.Trump to press India PM on anti-Muslim law Labour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Death toll rises to 24 in Delhi riots with mosque set on fireModi on course for big defeat as Delhi rejects ‘poisonous’ campaignA 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.He admits the situation is “very tense”.\u0026nbsp“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he saidFor some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thingClearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job? These attacks are not just damaging property, they are ruining people’s lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

Of course, they could also just have a cold.But nevertheless traders, exploration and refining unit staff were told to work remotely – something that is not possible in many businesses.Some folk are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks simply because they went on holiday to northern Italy.It’s getting even more needlessly dramatic within education.As it stands, Public Health England are NOT advising any schools to close.But eight now have been, while another  have quarantined pupils, forcing them to stay at home with their parents for a fortnight.In the most ridiculous case so far, an Essex primary school has been shut by its headmaster because one of its teachers spent half-term in Italy. That teacher is reportedly not sick or exhibiting any of the symptoms of coronavirus.We’ve already seen the very real cost to the market of such overreach, with £ billion wiped off the FTSE  in just  hours and the shares of travel companies like Tui and Easy Jet plummeting.The government is right and responsible to consider worst-case scenarios and plan appropriately.The Sun today revealed details of an official report showing that a catastrophic outbreak could see  per cent of Brits come down with coronavirus and , die.Of the  people tested for the virus in the UK,  have tested positive and eight of those have now been discharged.The reality is that for the vast majority of healthy people Coronavirus will not be fatal.Doing the basics right now – like washing your hands regularly and using tissues – will actually do more to help curb the spread than costly grand gestures.We must be vigilant and safe, but avoid Coronavirus hysteria.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And from the reaction we saw the people think the same, too.Good luck on this adventure in America and Canada — but I don’t think it will be long before he misses this country so much that he will want to come back and become a fully fledged member of the Royal Family.I hope his self-imposed exile is short-lived, but at the moment he is doing what his we wants and that is commendable. But the grass always looks greener over in the neighbouring field.So, Harry,you get fed up of making speeches to rich businessmen and you want to come back, just jump on the first plane and come home. We will welcome you with open arms.The love this country has for him has never stopped. As far as the nation is concerned he is still their number one member of the Royal Family.Harry is one of those instinctive people who do and say the first thing that comes into their head and when I saw him hugging people in Edinburgh I remembered why the public will always love him.Just before Christmas, when he visited a school in Luton, the students were queuing up to give him a hug before he left. That’s the Harry I know and love. We will miss him.Having toured with Harry for many years, he was a photographer’s dream — even when the tables were turned on me.In a youth club in New Zealand he was asked to put his painted hand on the wall, which he did.And then he rushed across the room and planted it on my head, as you see in the picture above.When we washed up afterwards he rebuked me for telling the whole nation on TV that morning he was going bald — just like his dad.I know his father, Prince Charles, is upset that his son is leaving and William, his best friend for many years, will also be sad to see his brother go.But the Queen has given him a year to review it and he will be welcomed like the prodigal sonhe decides his future is here back in Britain in the world’s number one family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading. The experts have been warning of a possible , deaths in the UK. We need to remember that is a very-worst-case scenario based upon a lot of “s”.But just to be on the safe side, shouldn’t we be carrying out compulsory checks on all visitors flying in from flu-stricken areas Instead of allowing people to “self-report” IN the coffee plantations of Guatemala, Central America, kids lug sacks of coffee beans around for eight hours a day.For this they are paid the princely sum of £. The coffee is used by posh coffee company Nespresso in its overpriced capsules.Nespresso’s “brand ambassador” is the liberal luvvie actor George Clooney.

Well, I’d decided to give up donating to charities for a month or so. But happy to make a very noble exception. Never before in our democratic country has free speech been so under threat.It’s OK for gobby old tossers like Toby and me – we have a  to speak. But too often people are hounded from their jobs simply for expressing an opinion. Or barred from speaking at universities in case they upset someone.Or get a midnight visit from the Old Bill because they happened to like a joke about a transgender person.The fightback starts here. Later next month I’ll be visiting universities to unveil a Charter for Academic Freedom, drawn up by my political party, the Social Democrats. Nothing is more precious than the freedom to express one’s opinion.If it offends someone , my suggestion is: OK, sure, now get over it.He was very right-on, was Harvey. Had all the politically correct opinions. Much loved by the Obamas, of course.Always the way, isn’t it  The more a bloke tells you he’s a liberal and a feminist, the more women should reach for the can of Mace.I HAD a bowl of Alpen this week, for the first time in  years.My daughter’s just got a hamster and its food reminded me of the cereal I used to eat as a young teen. Came in a black box with a mountain on it. My mum bought it because she thought it looked posh and foreign.Indeed, I thought it came from Switzerland. It was actually made in Kettering, Northants.Anyway, I had a bowl of the stuff and couldn’t work out why it wasn’t as nice as I remembered.My Facebook friends told me it was because they’ve cut the sugar content. Probably that’s right.But isn’t it also that NOTHING tastes as good as how you remember it  Not Alpen, not Mars bars, not Monster Munch.And definitely not Heinz Sandwich Spread, which tastes to me these days like paint stripper.Have to say, the site seems to me to be run as a kind of grooming parlour for the benefit of middle-aged pervs. But it’s not just that. The longer your kids – and especially the girls – spend online, the greater their chances of developing depression and other mental illnesses.They also end up with a much shorter attention span. Because they spend their days swiping backwards and forwards in a nanosecond.If we’re to avoid rearing a generation of doolally morons, we need to ration the time they spend online.It’s down to us parents to do that – not the State and not even the companies who run the godawful sites.WAS out walking with the dog this week.

two-week quarantine.But an FCO spokeswoman said: Were in touch with Spanish authorities but as far as were aware theres no plans for a flight at the moment.A later statement said: We are urgently seeking clarication from the Canary Island authorities following their announcement that  tourists of dferent nationalities will be granted permission to leave the Costa Adeje Palace Hotel.We continue

and Duchess of Sussex since November, when the couple began a six-week holiday in Canada.But once Megxit has happened on March , Canada will stop providing security for the couple.The announcement suggests the £m cost of the couples round-the-clock protection will fall on UK taxpayers.The Canadian government statement said: As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis, the government statement said.The assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status.It comes as it was revealed that Harry and Meghan will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son from the politan Police.In a statement on their website the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son which should fall on the UK taxpayer based on the Dukes public profile by virtue of being born a royal, his military service, the Duchesss independent profile.Police fear resources will be stretched while protecting the couple who experts believe could make £bn following their split from the royal family.Senior officers are understood to be drafting emergency plans to double the ­British protection team guarding the family.Former Met protection officer Dai Davies said: In their current state the plans are unworkable.Harry and Meghan’s ­situation has called for a complete ripping up of the ­rulebook and they are acting like none of the rules apply to them.There is already a severe lack of trained officers and this is only adding to the Mets woes.Scotland Yard refused to comment when contacted by the Sun Online.A spokesman for the Sussexes said: Buckingham Palace does not comment on the details of security arrangement.There are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, estimates the couple are on course to triple the £million net worth of the Beckhams.After probing Harry and Meghans financial background, Mr Watts said: You cant underestimate the international appeal of being a Royal.And the appeal is even bigger in the US, Canada and the rest of the world.I think it’s possible that in ten years’ time, Prince Harry and Meghan could make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List with £m and £bn in the longer term.Prince Charles’s biographer, Tom Bower, slammed Meghan for trying to commercialise the monarchy despite having no status.He said: She has a whole career of commercial exploitation of herself.She has absolutely no status apart from being attached to the royal family.In their first joint UK event since their bombshell decision to cut ties with the royal family, the couple will attend the annual Endeavour Fund Awards on March  in London.They were last seen together on January  when they visited Canada House in London to thank the nation for hosting

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is thought to have picked up the bug after dining with a colleague who had recently ed from China and was a carrier but showed no symptoms.On Thursday prosecutor Domenico Chiaro told The Sun:”The investigation will focus on eventual responsibilities for the handling of this man’s clinical file.”Cops have seized paperwork and notes from the hospital as part of their investigation and are looking at charge of “culpable epidemic spreading”.  Earlier this week Italy’s prime minster Giuseppe Conte pointed a finger of blame at Codogno hospital saying it had “made errors” in handling patient one.Italy has carried out more than , tests have been carried out in Italy and the country has seen a massive jump in positive results from just three cases a week ago.As a precaution the government in Rome has closed schools, offices, shops, churches and five top Serie A football matches this weekend will be played behind closed doors. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Errol weighed just k when his body was found by bailfs who broke into his council flat to evict him in June . His Employment and Support Allowance and Housing Benefit had been stopped in October  because he had not attended  a Work Capability Assessment on  August . His housing benefit was also later stopped. A coroner heard Mr Graham, had serious mental health dficulties including long-term depression. An inquest found his loss of income was likely to have caused huge distress. Today, Errolaposs daughter-in-law Alison Turner, sent a pre-action letter to the DWP arguing that their systems and procedures around cancelling benefits are unlawful. She also claims that the secretive investigations and reviews being conducted by the DWP into benefit-related deaths are unlawful and must be reformed. Alison, , from Nottinghamshire, argues in her case that the DWP has failed to put in place effective mechanisms to identy the risks and flaws in its system, correct them, and prevent further deaths occurring. Amongst the complaints, they argue that the termination of Errol’s benefits, and the relevant policy or system in place, were incompatible with his human rights. Alison, said: “The government owes it to Errol, his family and the country to explain why the DWP has repeatedly failed to learn from these tragedies over many years. In Errol’s memory I am determined to fight for change so that no more families have to live through the horror we have.”A DWP spokesman said: Our sympathies are with Mr Graham’s family. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.”Tessa Gregory, solicitor from law firm Leigh Day representing Alison, said: “One of the alarming features of Errol’s death is that according to the DWP their safeguarding policies were followed to the letter. Errol was flagged as highly vulnerable, and all the necessary steps under the policies were taken, but a decision was still made to terminate all of his benefits without finding anything out about his physical or mental health.

Political parties accepted a combined total of £,, in  - the largest value ever reported in one year and almost £ million more than , the year with the previous largest value of donations.The blockbuster figure was boosted by the Conservative Party attracting almost four times as much cash than the Labour Party, which reported just under £ million between October and December. Digger billionaire Lord Bamford, his son Jo and brother Mark donated a total of £. million across  donations to the party. Billionaire Theatre mogul John Gore, investment banker Peter Hargreaves, former Redrow Homes boss Steve Morgan and insurance entrepreneur Peter Wood gave the party £ million each. And financier Michael Spencer gave the party £m split between two donations of £, and a further £, in smaller gts to local parties via his firm IPGL.

So now we need to redouble our efforts to raise £, by the time Labouraposs new leader is in place, or we wonapost have the resources to match them.

One such lot was a day at the cricket with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, which raised £, for party coffers. It canapost carry on like this, a Tory source said. A box at a one-day international would set you back  grand evenit didnapost have the Chancellor in it. The source said donors were more willing to part with cash under Theresa Mayaposs leadership because they were scared of Jeremy Corbyn . Attendees noted PM Boris Johnson left the event very early.Meanwhile, it has emerged Lubov Chernukhin, a Russian financier whose husband is a former ally of Vladimir Putin, bought a tennis match with Mr Johnson at the event.Ms Chernukhin has previously bid hundreds of thousand of pounds to gain private access to prime ministers - including a game of tennis with David Cameron and Mr Johnson in  and a girls night out with Theresa May and a host of ministers last year. Another Tory source said while the table plan for the event had Ms Chernukhin seated with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, she ended up sitting with Mr Johnson all night. New figures show she also donated £, to the party in the months leading up to the election. Jon Trickett MP, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister said: “For years the UK economy has failed to work for the majority of people in this country, instead benefiting an increasingly small few in the City of London. “These latest donations confirm that the Conservative Party is the Party of this few, and that they cannot be trusted to govern in the interests of the many. “The time is long overdue for an overhaul of our political finance rules, which fail to protect our democracy from undue influence.” Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats were handed £ million by former Labour minister Lord Sainsbury - an outspoken opponent of Brexit .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBritain and the EU have kick-started frantic talks on a Brexit trade deal as both sides lay out their demands. The EU published its -page negotiating directives on Tuesday - and now the UK has hit back with a -page document of its own. It confirms Boris Johnsonaposs plans to insist on full control over key areas including state aid, workersapos rights, environmental standards and fishing rights. And that means it heralds major rows over areas including business competition - the so-called level playing field - after No junked previous commitments to Brussels.Whataposs more, Boris Johnson will threaten to walk away from the talks as soon as Junethings are not moving fast enough.These are only the starting points, of course. If there is a trade deal, both sides will probably meet somewhere in the middle. Butthey start too far apart, itaposll scupper any hope of an agreement and weaposll be left high and dry. These talks are crucial for the future of the UK. If we donapost have a trade deal with the EU by  December , transitional rules will expire. That means itaposll be harder to travel, new checks will spring up, and billions of pounds worth of goods will be whacked with major tarfs as they pass through ports like Dover. Yet itaposs understood the UK government has no plan to publish an impact assessment of todayaposs planned deal. Meaning weaposll have little clue the extent of how it hits businesses and your family. Hereaposs our guide to the key sticking points in the coming talks - the areas where they could fall apart. . Fishing  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants to let EU fishermen continue fishing in UK waters - avoiding any economic dislocation. It wants a fishing arrangement to follow some EU laws. And crucially, it wants a new fisheries deal to be signed and ratied by  July . EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier said a free trade deal with the UK had to include fishing rights or there wonapost be any agreement at all. He added: Fisheries is part of a package as regards our trade relations, which are to be discussed, and that package is one you canapost break up. There will be no ambiguity at all around that.WHAT THE UK SAYS: The UK says Britain must become an independent coastal state. That means agreeing annual negotiations on access to fishing waters - and any EU vessels granted access to fish in UK waters would have to follow UK rules. The UK insists it wonapost trade away fishing rights infor a trade deal.. European courts  WHAT THE EU SAYS: To enforce the overall deal, the EU and the UK will have to agree to a dispute settlement system. The EU insists the European Court of Justice must have the final say on some disputes under this - and the dispute body must agree to follow whatever decision it makes.WHAT THE UK SAYS: The UK flat-out rejects this. The document says there will be no role for the ECJ in the dispute resolution mechanism or any of the arrangements reached between the two sides.. Extending the transition period  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The transition period will end on  December , but a joint committee can decide before July  this year to extend it by up to one or two years. EU chiefs have encouraged an extension, saying there isnapost enough time to figure out a full trade deal.WHAT THE UK SAYS: Britain has totally ruled out extension. Page four of the document states: The government will not extend the transition period. That effectively means that at the June summit,a deal doesnapost look likely by the end of the year, the UK will prepare to walk away with no trade deal.. Business competition  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EUaposs big demand is a aposlevel playing fieldapos. This means having similar trade rules for both sides - and guaranteeing the UK canapost use leaving the EU to undercut its former partners to scoop up business. In , it would mean UK businesses get tarf-free access to EU markets. WHAT THE UK SAYS: The phrase level playing field doesnapost appear anywhere in the -page document. Britain says the trade deal should maintain effective competition laws - but this does not require regulatory alignment or linking the UKaposs rules to the EUaposs. The document explicitly adds: Both parties should have the regulatory freedom to respond to new and emerging challenges in these areas.If Britain signed up to the EUaposs request the implications would be far-reaching, limiting its abilities to strike wide-ranging deals with the rest of the world, including potentially the US.  . State aid WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants the UK to keep following EU rules on aposstate aidapos - the amount of government support that can be given to industries like steel. Under EU rules, governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from Brussels. Any disputes would have to be dealt with through a joint process.WHAT THE UK SAYS: Britain rejects the idea of a binding aposlevel playing fieldapos - and the document proposes a more woolly commitment to be fair to both sides. It says any state-owned enterprises should operate in a fair and transparent manner and not discriminate against businesses in the other party.Effectively, theyaposre saying they wonapost sign up to EU rules, but within the terms of the agreement the UK and EU can agree not to drastically undercut each other. . Environment  WHAT THE EU SAYS: EU leaders say the UK must uphold all of Brusselsapos environmental standards that are in force as at  December . Britain would also have to commit to the EUaposs climate change targets where relevant.And the UK would need a system of carbon pricing to cost pollution that has at least the same effectiveness and scope as the EUaposs. Brussels wants Britain to simply link its emissions trading system to the EUaposs. WHAT THE UK SAYS: Again, Britain rejects a binding aposlevel playing fieldapos. Instead it calls for aposreciprocal commitments not to weaken or reduceapos environment standards on either side.. Workersapos rights  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The document says Britain must not lower any labour or social protection laws below the level of the EUaposs as at  December . Those include workplace rights health and safety consultation rules and fair conditions. This stops short of dynamic alignment - following EU rules as they change.WHAT THE UK SAYS: As with state aid and the environment, Britain agrees to include reciprocal commitments not to weaken workersapos rights laws. But the UK rejects the demand to follow EU laws, saying the agreement should recognise the right of each party to set its labour priorities and adopt or mody its labour laws.. A security treaty  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants to include security and defence as part of the talks on a trade deal. Thataposs because the UK has the upper hand in this, as one of the continentaposs leading powers.WHAT THE UK SAYS: A UK source confirmed the British government is unwilling to follow that path. We expect to cooperate closely with our allies, including the EU, the source said. We donapost think we need an institutional treaty framework to achieve this.The UK is only looking to discuss legal agreements on much narrower elements of security cooperation, including to be able to share sensitive and classied information with the bloc. Britain will also not take part in the European Arrest Warrant and instead develop a new system based on Norway and Iceland. .

Stephanie McDonough, , and partner David Burrows, , were shocked to find a large molar in a pork curry they ordered from the Newtown Road Cantonese Takeaway in Worcester last October. David, a warehouse operator, was a few mouthfuls into the dish when he discovered the object and spat it out. But following an inspection, health and safety bosses have said that while the find must have been unpleasant and stressful, there are no grounds for formal action. The restaurantaposs hygiene rating will therefore not need to be downgraded. The takeawayaposs manager, who only gave his name as Mr Chen, says there is no issue with cleanliness in his business. He added that all his staff are happy to be DNA tested to prove the tooth does not belong to them. The inspector checked all the staff to seewe have any teeth missing, which we donapost, he said. We donapost know where the tooth came from. If necessary, all of the staff are willing to do a DNA test to prove itaposs not our tooth. This inspection is proof that there is no problem at all with hygiene at the shop. Mr Chen added that the shop has had numerous prank calls since the incident, including customers asking for teeth in their meals. Hopefully customers will not jump to the conclusion about the tooth, he continued. We have a good reputation at the shop. It is a well-established business thataposs been going for over ten years. We would like to thank all our customers that still come to our shop. We are appreciative of their support. We can promise to maintain our standards and to get even better in the future.  Stephanie and David, who immediately lodged a complaint following their discovery, were offered a free meal and a full refund but only accepted the £. they had paid for the meal. Helen Cameron, food safety manager at Worcestershire Regulatory Services, says the body is satisfied that the restaurant takes all reasonable steps to ensure its food is safe to eat. A lab report has confirmed it was a human molar tooth that was passed to us by the complainant, she said.

Filmmaker Lucy Sheen was on her way to rehearsals when a white male passenger whispered in her ear: Why donapost you f**k off back to China and take your filth with you. The filmmaker was taken aback by the incident but said it is far from isolated. Only today I read of another incident on public transport where another East Asian female was taunted and called aposcoronavirusapos, she told the . Ms Sheen identies as transracial, having been born in Hong Kong in the s before being adopted in Britain - she then went on to study at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama. She claimed racism of the kind she suffered on the bus is nothing new to British people of East Asian heritage or from overseas.Taking to Twitter on February  to vent about the incident, she used the hashtags #coronavirus and #racism.In my case, what shocked me was the stealth - the fact that this person had obviously made a decision to say what he did but do it in a covert manner.If he’d shouted that out I can deal with that, I could have handled that, she continued. It’s like any form of bias, prejudice or racism that is undercover, ingrained, institutionalised or structural, it’s very very hard to challenge or to try and change those entrenched views. Ms Sheen, who has dyslexia but has written, directed and acted in several celebrated productions - one of which appeared at the Venice Film Festival - feels todayaposs political climate has much to answer for.In the current climate along with the current government and what they seem to be supporting, it has given a great excuse for anti East Asian sentiments and [something for] racists to hang their racism upon. She said the bus incident made her feel both angry and deeply sad. I am British. I was born on the crown colony of Hong Kong, so British courtesy of the British Empire.  I was brought over to this country because of that. There have and will always be a minority who do not like [or] do not want people like me of whatever colour to be here. They see us as inferior and subservient and less than human because we are not white.But the temperature now post Brexit referendum and post new Conservative government and [Boris] Johnson as PM has become so racially toxic it feels like open season on [people of colour], and especially East Asians, [towards which]  racism has never quite been as unacceptable."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus buxton town lockdown after","story":"NewsCoronavirus in Buxton: Town on lockdown after parent catches killer bug in TenereA parent in Buxton, Derbyshire, has been diagnosed with coronavirus and it is believed he or she stayed at a now-quarantined Tenere hotel where four Italians were carrying the killer bugShareCommentsByChris KitchingEugene HendersonThomas Hornall:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video ambulance-spotted-buxton-amid-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-buxton-town-lockdown-after-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It is believed the parent, from Buxton, Derbyshire, caught the bug while staying at a Tenere hotel that has since been quarantined with about  Britons trapped inside. Their childaposs primary school and a medical practice visited by the patient have both closed for deep cleans amid fears that others in Buxton could have been infected. Burbage Primary School alerted parents and carers in a text message, saying a parent had been diagnosed with the flu-like virus. Public Health EnglandEast Midlands said bosses at the school took the decision to close, despite PHE assessing the risk and confirming there was no reason to. Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, director of PHE East Midlands, said: We are aware that Burbage Primary School in Buxton has taken the decision to close today.My team have spoken to the school, assessed the risk and confirmed that there is currently no information to suggest that there is any increased health risk to any pupils or staff at the school and no public health reason to remain closed at the current time.”About a mile away, Buxton Medical Practice closed as a precaution, with a voice message telling prospective patients to stay away. A video on Twitter allegedly shows the patient being whisked away in a convoy of emergency services vehicles at about .pm on Wednesday after being picked up by medics in protective suits. Have you been affected by coronavirus in Buxton  Email webnews@mirror. It came as Public Health England confirmed two more cases in the UK, bringing the total to . The other person was in a London hospital after catching the virus in Italy. In Buxton, it is understood the parent had recently ed to the town of , from Tenere after staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, where four Italian tourists tested positive for coronavirus this week. Britons are among about  guests in a -day quarantine and there are fears the virus could sweep through the hotel like it did the Diamond Princess cruise ship while it was quarantined in Japan. Burbage Primary Schoolaposs head, Anthony Tierney, was on site to speak to concerned parents on Thursday morning. He confirmed that the gates would remain closed for the day. It is understood the school may not reopen until Monday at the earliest.  Mr Tierney said: We are shut, it is just a precaution. I canapost say anything more at the moment. Panicked parents took to social media after receiving the bombshell message which was sent out just before pm on Wednesday night. Many complained about the lack of a full explanation as to whether the infected parent had actually been on the school premises. The school, which has  pupils and  members of staff, gave no further details about the coronavirus victim. The message sent to parents and carers read: Due to a confirmed case of coronavirus amongst our parent population, Burbage Primary School will be closed as a precautionary measure to enable a deep clean to be completed.  “A further update will be shared tomorrow.” At first some parents thought the message was a hoax, which lead to hundreds of messages on Facebook and Twitter. But one parent posted: My daughter goes to the school. I can confirm that the school have put out the message to parents. They have also asked people not to post hysterical messages on social media. A parent criticised the online speculation, writing on Facebook: It may be precautionary and the parent may not have been on the premises but has a child at the school who has been exposed to the virus. The virus is transmittable before any symptoms are shown so to give no context or further explanation is irresponsible!!But another parent replied: What context is missing  Parent infected, their kids at the school. Virus can infect without symptoms early on. School closes to get cleaned. Whataposs missing  A dferent parent criticised the speculation about the seriousness of the situation before any further details were released. I feel for the staff and headmaster who will have to deal with the members of the public who are now worrying over precautionary measures, she wrote. Another replied: Why shouldnapost they worry  Itaposs contagious before symptoms show. If the parent has it then likely the child children do also. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Buxton Medical Practice said: We have a confirmed case of the coronavirus.  We are liaising with Public Health England and the CCG to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Please do not come to the practice. The practice later wrote on Facebook: Just a quick update to say we have talked to Public Health England and their advice is that we should be able to open tomorrow after a deep clean today. We are also advised that there is currently no need for additional testing for patients or staff. Thank you for your patience. Members of Derbyshire County Councilaposs emergency planning team were called into the authorityaposs headquarters in Matlock early to deal with the issue. A spokesman for the council said: We are aware of the reports and are awaiting confirmation from Public Health England.  We will release further information as soon as we get it. Local resident Zoe Milly Jones posted video on Twitter showing two paramedic vehicles with their flights flashing as the patient was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital. Medics had stopped at a Morrisons petrol station to put on hazmat suits before collecting someone from a property in Buxton. Ms Jones wrote: Just followed two ambulances and two response units from Stockport, to Buxton on blue lights in convoy.. where men in Hazmat suits entered a property, and seemingly put someone in an ambulance. Then blue light convoyed back to stockport. Could it be #coronavirus in #buxton.  She told : The first place I saw them, where I took the video was on the A, in Hollingworth. They turned right onto the A heading toward Glossop. I followed them the entire way, as it looked suspicious. The ambulances stopped on Morrisonsapos petrol station in Buxton at first. Where they changed into white suits. Then they moved onto the house in Buxton, where someone got into the ambulance. Then they convoyed back on blue lights again. I followed them all the way back. They went into a loading bay at Liverpool Royal Hospital. Another resident wrote on Facebook: Just Seen  ambulances in convoy coming from buxton way with lites but driving slow all staff at mask on anybody know why anybody know why.  Hailed as a gateway to the Peak District National Park, Buxton is set in north-west Derbyshire, about  miles south-east of Manchester. Residents were shocked when they found out that someone amongst them was infected with the disease. Lynne Gracie, who lives close to the primary school, told DerbyshireLive: “The news has left me gobsmacked. My thoughts and sympathy go out to all affected. It’s a popular school and has just had new classrooms. “I don’t mingle with the school community, I don’t have children but I can understand their concerns. It’s a worrying situation.” Ruth George, who represents Whaley Bridge on Derbyshire County Council, appealed for calm.  She wrote on Facebook: “It’s important that we don’t panic about the coronavirus, but we also need to do all we can to protect people. “Thank you to Burbage School in Buxton for taking sensible precautions. I hope that parents - and their employers - will understand the need to make sure this highly infectious virus doesn’t get spread.” Director of Public Health for Derbyshire County Council Dean Wallace said: I’d like to reassure people that the risk to the general public remains low and Derbyshire County Council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Derbyshire are protected. Public Health England said the UKaposs two new cases involved a patient who ed from Tenere and a second who had been in Italy, where  people have died amid the worst contagion in Europe. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said: Two further patients in England have tested positive for COVID-, bringing the total number of UK cases to . The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenere and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital, London. So far in the UK more than , people have been tested for the virus and of the  to have tested positive, eight have so far been discharged from hospital. About  schools have closed for at least one day this week and around  others - including Prince Georgeaposs in south London - have sent some staff and students home to self-isolate. In most cases, it is because pupils and staff recently ed from ski trips in northern Italyaposs red zone. Prince George and Princess Charlotteaposs primary school, Thomasaposs Battersea, has sent pupils home as a precautionary measure following trips to northern Italy. But schools and businesses have been urged not to overreact. Public Health England said that its general advice is not to close schools - a message echoed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Guidance was sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. Coronavirus has been spreading across Europe this week, with Italy becoming the epicentre with more than  people infected and  dead. The northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto have been locked down. Travellers ing to the UK from northern Italy were told they may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of illness. No plans to rescue Brits Elsewhere, the Foreign Office denied there were any plans to evacuate around  Britons who remain in the coronavirus-hit hotel H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel in Tenere. However, it has arranged for written messages to be put under the doors of the rooms of British guests asking them to get in contact. Some Britons who are trapped at the hotel for two weeks have now begged Boris Johnson to send a plane to rescue them.  About  guests from  countries are stuck there during the quarantine. Disease specialists have said the new coronavirus cases are not surprising and the UK should expect more infected patients without direct China links as the virus continues its spread in Europe. Experts re-emphasised there is no due cause for alarm and said the most important act for iniduals is regular, thorough hand-washing and immediately binning tissues which have been coughed and sneezed on. Professor Rowland Kao, chairman of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said: We already have evidence of onward transmission occurring outside of China and so these two cases - associated with situations with high levels of infections - are not surprising. This occurrence should therefore already be well within the scope of the current approach to control. It does highlight that we should continue to expect more cases without direct association with China, and therefore, despite evidence of the epidemic tailing off in China, a need for continued vigilance with appropriate control measures for some time.

The change affects Londonaposs congestion zone and comes into force the minute after the clock strikes midnight on March . The lower speed limit proposal to lower motoristsapos speeds to reduce the numbers of deaths and injuries won strong public support. Speed is a factor in around  per cent of collisions in London where a person dies or is seriously injured, according to City Hall figures. The new mph speed limits will be enforced across all TfL roads within the Congestion Charging Zone – including Millbank, Victoria Embankment and Borough High Street. The change will also see the politan Police ramp up patrols. From April a new speed enforcement team will target careless and illegal driving across London, a joint announcement with the Mayor and TfL today said.   Mr Khan has set a target to eliminate death and serious injury from Londonaposs transport network by . The mayor said in a statement today: “I am absolutely determined to do everything I can to eradicate all deaths and serious injuries on London’s roads and these new measures are a vital step along the way to helping us to achieve this. By cutting speed limits on TfL’s roads within the Congestion Zone we are saving lives, while at the same time making our streets more appealing for Londoners to walk and cycle around the capital.” The TfL roads affected by the new mph limit within the Congestion Charging Zone are:Albert Embankment Lambeth Palace Road, Lambeth Bridge Millbank Victoria Embankment Upper Thames Street, Lower Thames Street, Byward Street, Tower Hill Borough High Street, Great Dover Street Blackfriars Road Part of Druid Street , Crucix Lane, part of Bermondsey StreetPart of Tooley Street , Duke Street Hill, Part of Queen Elizabeth Street The mph limit will also be introduced at Aldgate Gyratory, including Leman Street, Prescot Street, Mansell Street, Minories and Goodmanaposs Yard, which is on the boundary of the CCZ rather than within it.The Tooley Street mph limit was developed in a separate project but will come into force at the same time as the TfL roads. The change was welcomed by road safety advocates, including London Campaign Coordinator, ’s Plenty and RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims. Both organisations said they would like to see the speed reduction expanded to more roads in London, and today called on boroughs outside the city centre to adopt lower speed proposals. Met Police detective superintendent Andy Cox said: “Safe speeds are key to achieving the Vision Zero ambition and it’s vital that those driving or riding on our roads respect the law on speed limits. We will actively target speeding and dangerous drivers and ensure they are dealt with robustly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man thanks huge belly saving","story":"NewsMan thanks his huge belly for saving his le after he falls down pub stepsColin Hayes is one of three people to fall down the same steps at Christopher Creeke Wetherspoon pub in Bournemouth in the last eight months, including one man in his s who later diedShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  FEB NewsColin Hayes weighed  stone when he fell \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Workers at Stockport Village Nursery, now home to an incredible eight sets of non-identical and one pair of identical twins, believe their preschool in Stockport, Greater Manchester, is the only one in the UK to have ever looked after this many at once. They were amazed when they realised they had three sets of twins attending at the same time - and thought they were seeing double when six more later arrived, all from the same area. Weaposve always had a lot of twins but when we had three sets we were quite shocked so to have nine is something , says nursery manager Lyndsey Cross, .

The twinsapos ages range from five months to four years old - with Lottie and Gracie Catterall being the youngest of the lot.

To reduce confusion, each set of twins has been assigned to a dferent member of staff.  Although the youngsters often arrive in matching outfits, as they arenapost all identical there is thankfully no need for name tags.

A spokesman from STL training, which commissioned the research, said: The study suggests many office workers feel they have a skills gap around key computer applications. Some employees may have been in their role for a while, and expectations of competencies around technology can be presumed by an employer, without seeing the need to empower their staff with training. A lack of understanding of the fundamental applications at the centre of office le can be hugely counter-productive for businesses, and demotivating for staff. The study also found nearly one in five of employees have aposblaggedapos their way through a presentation or giving a fellow colleague advice.

So far, the number of people affected in the UK has stayed mercully low. This does not mean we should be complacent. The global outbreak has already cost thousands of lives, hit stock prices and disrupted businesses and sports events. Here schools have been closed and offices evacuated. Ministers are already planning for the worst case scenario amid fears the NHS could be unable to cope with a mass outbreak here.  If we reach epidemic levels routine operations will have to be cancelled and hospitals may struggle to find enough beds. The Tories may wish to ask themselvesthat would be the casethey had not starved our health service of funds for the last decade. The Government needs to calibrate its response carefully. It should put in place all the measures necessary to contain the virus while not whipping up alarm. Panic will not help. In time a vaccine will hopefully be developed. Until then we should follow the medical advice, and keep calm and carry on. Homes truths Nobody doubts we need to build more homes to address Britain’s housing crisis. But they need to be sited in the right places. More than , homes are being planned in areas deemed at high risk of flooding. These are on top of , built in - in flood zones. This defies common sense. Owners will be saddled with properties that are uninsurable, uninhabitable and unsellable. The Government needs to call time on these ill-judged developments and devise a housing plan that takes account of the climate crisis. Business as usual will only result in more flood-stricken families living in misery.

In the footage posted online by his mum, Quaden, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, says he is sick of cruel jibes over his appearance and admits he wants to die. The footage of the nine-year-old from Australia broke hearts around the world and the fund has so far raised more than , Australian dollars. But his family now say that while they are touched by the goodwill of strangers, they will donate the money fundraised for him to charity instead.  In an interview with NITV News, Quadenaposs Aunty Mundanara Bayles said: What kid wouldnapost want to go to Disneyland, especiallyyou have lived Quadenaposs le. To escape to anywhere that is fun that doesnapost remind him of his day to day challenges.But my sister said aposyou know what, letaposs get back to the real issueapos.

The auntie said they need to make sure people are not bullied. She said that they did want to go to Disneyland, but that the community would benefit far more from the donation. They have earmarked two organisations they would like to benefit from the fundraised cash: Dwarfism Awareness Australia and Balunu Healing Foundation.  When the video was posted online, thousands commented showing their support. One wrote: Awwh our darling boy this is so unfair. Please go straight too the head of education.

Aleksandra Sadowska, , has no sight in her right eye and is fast losing her ability to see through her left. The model - who had the tattoo done in Warsaw, Poland, because she wanted to look like her favourite rap artist - had the whites of her eyes dyed black. Now the man who did it, a tattoo artist named in local media as Piotr A, faces up to three years in jail over the bungled procedure. Aleksandra was initially told that the pain she was experiencing was normal, according to reports, and that she could take painkillers. However medics say there is no hope of repairing her eyesight, and said she will soon be fully blind. She said: Unfortunately, for now doctors do not give me much optimism for improvement. The damage is too deep and extensive. Iaposm afraid I will be completely blind. And she continued: I will not lock myself in the basement and get depressed. I have sadness behind me, but I live on. She is a devotee of Polish rapper Popek, who she wanted to emulate. He has undergone a similar eye tattoo. According to Polska , Aleksandra has undergone three procedures aimed at restoring her sight, but discovered that the dye had gone into her tissue.The ink used was only suitable to be used on skin, it is claimed, and should not come into contact with the eyeballs. Lawyers for Alexandra told the Polish media: There is clear evidence that the tattoo artist did not know how to perform such a delicate procedure.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA shocked woman has revealed the henna horror she suffered after a holiday tattoo left her scarred and in hospital. Rachel Major, , was on holiday in the Dominican Republic, Caribbean, in December  when she decided to get a henna tattoo on her right ankle from a stall nearby. Delighted with the initial result, the real estate agent had no problems with her  [£.] black henna tattoo until it started itching ten days after it was done. Then, over the course of the next week, Rachelaposs temporary tattoo started to blister and swell - worsening to the point where she had trouble walking and had to be rushed to hospital for treatment. Rachel, from Wyoming, Michigan, US, is sharing her story to encourage others to avoid having holiday henna as it has left her currently scarred and recovering from the pain. She said: I had never had henna done before, so when I saw the stand I thought I would get it done to make my foot look pretty whilst wearing sandals on the beach. I saw lots of other people getting their henna done from this stand, so thought it would be fun. When I first had it done I loved the result and it seemed fine for the first nine days - it wasnapost until the tenth day that it became very itchy. After that the itching didnapost stop and it started blistering and swelling and would burn every time I walked, making it hard for me to walk at times.  When it got too much I went to the urgent care unit at the hospital and was prescribed two dferent types of medication and a cream, which helped everything go down, but the scar still remains. It was the worst decision I have ever made and would never get henna again - and wouldnapost advise anyone  to in case their skin reacts the same! Despite the scar currently residing on her foot, Rachel is hoping that it wonapost be permanent. She said: I hope that it wonapost scar forever - but you can currently still see the outline of the henna.  Iaposm hoping that this is because the skin there didnapost get a sun tan, so itaposs really pale and itaposs fresh new skin. This summer Iaposm going to try and tan that part of my ankle so that you can no longer see the henna outline - butthat doesnapost work Iaposm not sure what Iaposll do! Iaposm just glad that the henna was only on my foot and nowhere  on my body - as a permanent scar anywhere  could be a lot more noticeable. It definitely wasnapost worth what I went through for the promise of a couple of weeks of a pretty tattoo.  RACHELaposS HENNA TIMELINE: DAY ONE TO NINE - No issues. DAY TEN - Itching began. DAY  - Itching got more severe. DAY  - Rachel applied homemade remedyaposs to remove the remaining ink including: olive oil, salt, lemon juice, anti-bacterial soap, hydrogen peroxide, nail polish remover, toothpaste. DAY  - Blistering began, Rachel started soaking ankle twice a day in epsom salt and icing the ankle.

If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah-launches-tokyo-passport-programme","story":"ACTIVE children from across the Borders will be rewarded this summer by local leisure charity, Live Borders.To celebrate the  Tokyo Olympics the local active schools teams have devised Games Passports for youngsters to sweat their way towards bronze, silver and gold medals.Every primary school pupil in the Borders will be able to take part from next month.Great British hockey star Sarah Robertson, who is originally from Selkirk, officially launched Training for Tokyo  Games Passport this week.She said: \"The Passport is a great initiative to get the kids across the Borders taking part in a number of sports.ldquoGetting kids out playing hockey, football, golf or tennis is brilliant, and with the excitement of the Olympics just around the corner it is a great chance to trial some of the sports like badminton, karate or table tennis.ldquoGrowing up, I played all dferent sports and I believe it has helped make me become a well-rounded hockey player with transferable skills from many sports.ldquoWho knows, this yearrsquos Passport may just uncover a future Borders Olympian.This is the fth Passport scheme that Live Borders has overseen following the  London Olympics,  Glasgow Commonwealth Games,  Rio Olympics and the  Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.The organisers hope to encourage primary pupils to enjoy a range of sports while trying to gain points towards a medal of their own.Senior Active Schools coordinator Paul Scott added: ldquoWe believe it is important to continue to build a lasting legacy in sport and physical activity participation in the Scottish Borders.ldquoOver the last eight years since London  we have ran four Passports and all of them have achieved huge success in encouraging more children to be more active, more often.ldquoWe canrsquot wait to get started and hope our young Bordersrsquo people enjoy the challenge while being healthier, happier and stronger.Each P-to-P and P-to-P Passport lists a number of dferent sports from the Tokyo Olympics.Pupils can accumulate points by taking part in as many of the sports as possible between Monday, March  and the conclusion of the Olympics on Sunday, August .For more information on the Training for Tokyo  Games Passport, visit www.liveborders.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"30-communities-set-great-borders-river-clean","story":"NEXT weekend more than  communities living along the Tweed and its tributaries are set for the biggest clean up ever held in the Borders.Throughout Saturday and Sunday, February  and March , around  eco-conscious volunteers will be rolling up their sleeves for the second Great Borders River Clean.The inaugural event in October attracted  rubbish collectors who bagged an incredible . tonnes of discarded wrappers, bottles and other environmentally damaging items.And with more and more communities signed up it is expected even more rubbish will be collected next weekend.St Marys School teacher Tom Rawson is the brains behind the Great Borders River Clean.He told us: \"I have been blown away by the response to this event.\"There is something about rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in to solve a common problem that has captured peoples imaginations.\"Its easy to see plastic pollution as never-ending but it can be solvedenough people see the effects and are willing to do something about it.\"This is something that young people, in particular, understand.\"I have been delighted to see schools, Scout groups, sports teams and community groups across the Borders engaging with this event.\"This is something that has been actively encourage by St Marys School in Melrose and I am fortunate to have time allocated to the organisation of this growing event.\"Scottish Borders Council is supporting the event by funding litter grabbers.And all rubbish collected will be transported to the regions waste transfer station.As well as cleaning up the Tweed at Innerleithen it is also planned for a tidy-up of the mountain bike trails on Saturday.Tom added: \"I am keen to engage with anyone and everyone who enjoys being outside and who wants to help preserve and improve his or her natural environment.\"The Borders is a mountain biking paradise and so I am seeking to get that community actively involved with a joint river and trail clean at Innerleithen.\"Newcastletons clean has been moved forward to Friday, February .

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable.

It is the likes of Professor Jay that give the notion of the great and the good a good name.David Steel, Lord Steel as he became, has been in the public eye far longer than Professor Jay, some  years. Former Liberal leader, ex-MP and MSP, Presiding Officer in the Scottish Parliament from -, the Scot is a pillar of the liberal Establishment in every sense. Or at least he was until this week.: Lord Steel quitsOn Tuesday a report by IICSA criticised Lord Steel for his failure to act over the paedophile MP Cyril Smith, despite knowing about the allegations against him.The report concluded: ldquo[Lord Steel] looked at Cyril Smith not through the lens of child protection but through the lens of political expediency.Following the reportrsquos publication, Lord Steel announced his resignation from the LibDems and retiral from the House of Lords.If it seems a small price to pay for what the report called an ldquoabdication of responsibility that is because it is.The manner of Lord Steelrsquos leaving did not do him much credit either. Although he condemned Smithrsquos actions, he followed this by accusing IICSA of using him as a fall guy because all the prominent figures mentioned in the report were dead.ldquoNot having secured a parliamentary scalp, he said, ldquoI fear that I have been made a proxy for Cyril Smith.There is nothing like departing with good grace, and that was nothing like departing with good grace. But then when it comes to ocean-going, copper-bottomed hypocrisy you have to go a long way in British politics to beat the Liberal Democrats. In this sorry saga it is not just Lord Steel who should be resigning.: Victims criticise party inquiryIn his appearance before IICSA last year, Lord Steel gave evidence about a meeting with Smith in . He had asked to see Smith following the publication of allegations about the MP in Private Eye.As the IICSA report said: ldquoIt is clear that Lord Steel assumed from what Cyril Smith told him that he had committed the offences reported in Private Eye yet he did nothing about it.He did nothing because the offences took place before Smith joined the Liberal Party and became an MP. They were therefore, felt the then party leader, nothing to do with him.But the IICSA report was devastatingly clear on this point: ldquoThis failure to recognise the risk that Cyril Smith potentially posed to children was an abdication of responsibility by a political leader and an example of a highly placed politician turning a blind eye to something that was potentially troublesome to his party, with no apparent regard for criminal acts which might have occurred or for any victims, past or future.Lord Steel, who later recommended Smith for a knighthood, now says he had trouble hearing the questions at the inquiry and denies that Smith told him the Private Eye story was true. Yet as the inquiry said, he could have corrected his evidence at any point but did not.It was after he gave evidence that Lord Steel was suspended by the Scottish Lib Dems and a party investigation began.A short time later, without waiting for IICSA to report, the party lted the suspension and welcomed Lord Steel back into the fold.: Steel has whip restoredGiven the damning conclusions of the IICSA report, one has to wonder how rigorous this party investigation was. What evidence,any, was taken from others about what Lord Steel knew or did not know when Smith was alive When the suspension was lted, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Party leader, said Lord Steel had claried his initial IICSA evidence and as a result the party found no grounds for action. Why did Lord Steel not offer that same clarication to IICSA itself  What was the clarication Mr Rennie said on Tuesday that it was ldquoright that Lord Steel had resigned and would retire from the Lords. If this was an acceptance by Mr Rennie that the IICSA report was correct, then it is also, by implication, an admission that his partyrsquos inquiry got it wrong.In which case one wonders why Mr Rennie, who bears ultimate responsibility for the party investigation, is still in his job.The Lib Dems would clearly like everyone to accept that with Lord Steel gone from the party and the Lords there is nothing left to see here, and that we should all move on.But that is not good enough. The party needs to explain in detail why its investigation came to the conclusion it did.If it does not, then the public would be justied in thinking that Lord Steel had his suspension lted for no better reason than a General Election was widely held to be in the offing, and the party wanted to put a lid on the matter.The Lib Dems are never slow to accuse other parties of hypocrisythey think the occasion demands it. They are accustomed, by dint of their size and distance from power, to not being subject to as much scrutiny as larger parties.But now it is their turn to answer some dficult questions and they should do so without delay.The best way to start putting matters right would be to reopen the party investigation, and at the same time review internal inquiry procedures. Otherwise, what chance do future inquiries have of coming to the right conclusions Judging by his statements this week, Lord Steel feels himself hard done by, ill served after more than half a century in public le. He should instead be directing all of his sympathy towards the victims of Smith, none of whom will ever receive the justice they deserve."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-defends-scottish-governments-education-record-fmqs","story":"The First Minister was challenged by Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw on the falling exams pass rates over the space of  months ndash but she stressed that more pupils are now leaving school with qualications.Meanwhile, Education Secretary John Swinney has pointed to a series of Scottish Government mistakes, rather than an attempt to evade scrutiny, after contentious exam analysis was published at pm ndash after the weekrsquos Holyrood business had concluded.:As it happened: Nicola Sturgeon quizzed over education, drugs and Heathrow at FMQsWhen questioned by the Tory leader, Ms Sturgeon said . per centof young people left school with an SCQF level five qualication in -, compared to . per centin -.On the performance at higher levels, Ms Sturgeon said the number of pupils leaving school with a higher qualication rose from . per centto . per centin the same period.She added: \"This Government will never shy away from the improvements that need to be made.\"But data shows that school leavers obtaining one or more national qualication at Level  dropped by . per cent, there was a . per cent fall at Level  and a . percent drop at Highers.

Imagine the nations bus routes do turn into a network of mobile gang huts, full of boozed up teens terrorising elderly passengers and swinging from the fold up seats where buggies with innocent bairns are meant to fit.At least theyd be off the streets, eh In my extensive bus experience, wild behaviour is normally the preserve of the adults aboard. Last week on my journey there were glorious scenes between a beleaguered mum and her grown up son. He insisted he would sit upstairs while she complained her knees wouldnt allow her to join him.From half way along the bottom deck she screamed up to him, \"Get yersel down here.\" He would not budge and so the conversation was carried on between them as though they were in the house and he was shut in his bedroom, she insisting he come down for his tea.\"Ye cannae choose yer family, eh \" she aimed at a hipsterish young man behind her, in an attempt to strike up some bonhomie. He would have absolutely none of it and kept his gaze focused on his phone screen. Beautully done.While I do not share the naysayers concerns that the Scottish Governments plans for a National Concessionary Travel scheme for those aged  and under will lead to moving hotbeds of anti-social behaviour, I do think this policy has aimed and missed.Or, perhaps, aimed and not landed at the feet of enough people.Of course, its a refreshing change to be using the bus itself to send a message rather than sticking meaningless messages on the sides of buses.Bus use has fallen by  per cent over the past five years, data released this week by the Scottish Government shows. At the same time, car travel increased with a record number - three million - of cars now registered in Scotland.Overall, journeys made by public transport have fallen by eight million over the past year.People have a peculiar snobbery about bus travel that they do not have about trains. That quote, oft attributed to Margaret Thatcher, about bus travel being a sign of personal failure casts a long shadow. And there arent leagues of bus spotters hanging about depots in the manner of locomotive lovers.There seems to be a notion that buses are for the working classes, and not the respectable ones. Those who choose other modes of transport already seem to think the bus is a wild west wilderness and thats before the marauding young folk are added to the mix.Bus clientele, though, are attracted by convenience. Not everyone lives near or within walking distance of a train station but most streets have a bus route to serve them.Certainly the customer base is not attracted by a bargain. To travel by train from my home to Glasgow city centre is pound. for a . To travel the same distance by bus is pound. Thats a signicant sum to travel just over one mile.When I moved into my flat in  the bus fare for a single was p and remained so for over a year. Its now pound., a  per cent increase.Im sure the operator would point out that I can get the fare marginally cheaper by downloading its app and purchasing tickets that way but to do so would involve buying an updated smart phone, which Im not inclined to do. Nor should I be - bus travel should be affordable.While the bus network is in the control of private companies, it will always be designed to serve profit over people. In Glasgow there have been several services threatened with the axe and others axed completely. First Glasgow says these routes are not well used enough to continue but, for those who do use them, they are a leline.Were I still a teenager, the new concessionary scheme would be nothing to be because the bus route that serves the area of Coatbridge where I used to live has been stopped by First Glasgow. I used to take it in one direction to get to school and in the other direction to get into Glasgow for work.It was vital because the local train line didnt - and didnt until  - run on a Sunday, which is extraordinary when you stop to think about it.The route that was stopped, the , was the only direct service from that part of Coatbridge in to Glasgow, the only direct service up to Airdrie and also served Monklands University Hospital, all the local supermarket, the main GP surgery and the town centre. Now the area is served by a selection of shuttle buses, some that dont run on a Sunday, some that take long weekends off and some that run once an hour.I cant imagine its a unique case but it does illustrate the need for buses to be publicly owned and designed to serve the public rather than monetise them.If one of the main aims of the National Concessionary Travel scheme is to improve the environment then extend it to make bus travel free for all. Driving is infinitely more convenient than taking the bus so its no wonder that car journeys are on the increase.Buses are slow and expensive. To get to a recent hospital appointment I could have driven in  minutes for free. The bus takes  minutes and costs pound. for an all day ticket. Where is the inducement to spend nearly a fiver to sit for more than an hour on a bus when you can do acommute in comfort for  minutes \"Environment benefits\" are an opaque concept to many commuters. So far government and local council policy has been to force drivers away from their cars by punishment - raising parking costs, say - when motorists may respond more to luring than force.Raising fuel duty to make car use more unattractive is the right way to go but, once out of their cars, drivers need to know that money is being invested in a coherent, high quality and extensive bus service that preferably runs  hours.Free travel for children is a solid start but the next step needs to be ensuring bus travel is still an attractive proposition once they hit the age of ."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-back-budget-tories-say-free-bus-plan-con","story":"THE Scottish budget has cleared its first parliamentary stage amid taunts the Scottish Greens have been ldquoplayed like a fiddle in their deal with the SNP.MSPs voted  to  on the general principles of the Bill for the   budget, with the second and final votes expected to be a formality next week.It followed SNP Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie announcing on Wednesday they had struck a deal to get the package approved.After telling MSPs three weeks ago that the poundbn at the Governmentrsquos disposal had been fully allocated, Ms Forbes found an extra poundm at the last minute to bring the Greens on board.This includes poundm for councils, poundm for the police, and poundm to develop a free bus travel scheme for under-s starting in January .In a lively debate before the vote, the Tories said ldquoPatrick the poodle and his party had been taken in by a ldquocon trick, with the bus travel scheme far from certain to be delivered.Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoWhat have the Greens received  Theyrsquove received funding to support preparations to introduce concessionary farespossible, subject to research and due diligence.

While the circumstances that leylandii are planted will not be conclusive as to whether there is a hedge, it is a relevant consideration.\"The judge said: \"It may well be, as the petitionersubmitted, that woodland is sometimes planted in discernible rows.\"\"The pattern of the planting in rows was nonetheless a relevant consideration in discerning whether the trees were a hedge. Hedges are generally planted in a line of some sort,\" she said.It was argued on behalf of Mr Rizza that the reporter was irrational in ordering the identied trees to be cut back to two metres without considering the effect of one row on another and in concluding that the height reduction would not signicantly alter the privacy or outlook of the hedge owner.But Lady Carmichael said: \"The reporter was deciding what action was required to remedy the adverse effects of the height of the hedge on the enjoyment of  Drummond Circus that its occupant could reasonably expect to have.\"\"Having reached the conclusion she did as to the adverse effects, it was reasonably open to her to decide that the appropriate remedy was to require the whole hedge be reduced in height,\" said the judge.Mr and Mrs Niven originally applied to Highland Council in  seeking that a high hedges notice be issued.Mr Rizza subsequently appealed to the Scottish Ministers who appointed the reporter and she gave her decision in December .The reporter concluded that the high hedge was a barrier to light which impacted on the garden and the windows of rooms at the rear of  Drummond Circus.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"auld gits donation boost for foodbank","story":"A local society has presented Inverurie Foodbank with a cash donation after holding two recent fundraising events.The Auld Golfers of Inverurie Travelling Societyhanded over their donation of £, to the foodbank on Saturday, February .The Auld-GITS held a whisky tasting event and Golf Extravaganza and raised the money thanks to sales of raffles, auctions and bingo.Member Mark Jubb said: “Each year we pick a deserving local charity to donate money to.“Last year it was Gordon Dementia and this year we decided to choose the foodbank.“This money will be a great help for the foodbank and we hope they can continue the fantastic work that they do.”Val Shinnie, co-ordinator for Inverurie Foodbank, thanked the Auld-GITS and said the donation was “much appreciated”.She added: “The money will go into the Aberdeenshire North Foodbank pot and we will use it across the area when we need it.“We have wish lists at our local supermarkets soanyone would like to help us out please go along and see what we need.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Project Director Calum MacLean and Technical Director Matt Lewin\"  Kintore firm invests in new appointments viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"eco emergency event to be held in inverurie","story":"A one-day conference which will examine some of the most crucial issues affecting the environment and what can be done to address them will be held in Inverurie next month.The Eco Emergency Event, organised by Garioch Women for Change, will cover a wide range of topics in  dferent seminars throughout the day delivered by speakers from across Scotland, many of whom are taking innovative approaches in the battle against climate change.They include Jane Morrison, Executive Officer at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , who was named one of Scotland’s  Inspiring Women under  in .

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

I am delighted that council’s Inclusive Cycle scheme will now be available to more people with mobility needs in each of our three main towns.“In only a short time since it was launched as a pilot project, this initiative has proven very popular with people of all ages, who have been able to get out and take some exercise along designated cycle routes.“The purchase of the new cycle storage facilities has been made possible thanks to the funding awarded by the Department for Communities, and I congratulate the council officers involved with this wonderful project.”NI actress Helena Bereen makes London stage bow in her s in play that speaks ‘beyond the grave’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"ni actress helena bereen makes london stage bow in her 70s in play that speaks beyond the grave","story":"A Cullybackey actress in her s has made her London stage debut in a play written by an NI man who is posthumously raising money to combat suicide.Derrymacash playwright Joseph Crilly took his own le in a hotel in France in . More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .Stage set forof one-woman Ruby show Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2756668.jpg--.jpg?1582282800000\n","title":"my top 10 with utv s ken reid","story":"Ken Reid is UTV’s Political Editor. He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example. The ‘crisis’ question was, why would the Scottish and Irish be granted an ethnicity status while the English were left out of this Well, the ethnicity question I am interested in here also brings the African to the table.•Elly Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus apology after northern ireland family told to isolate for fortnight by public health agency","story":"-year-old Dan Douglas from Banbridge. Picture: BBC  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp-year-old Dan Douglas from Banbridge. Picture: BBC February   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Public Health Agencyhas apologised to a Northern Ireland family after they were advised to isolate themselves in their home after their son ed from an Italian ski trip. Dan Douglas , from Banbridge, Do Down, was told to self-isolate in his bedroom for  days after experiencing a cold after a visit to San Valentino in northern Italy. He had not been to any of the  towns at the epicentre of the outbreak in the country but was given incorrect advice after his mother Elaine made two separate phone calls to the PHA helpline. It comes after the PHA revealed there have been in the region of  calls to the helpline over the past two weeks. The agency said they have no record of which helpline operator - who are not medically trained - gave the advice but said they have now put new measures in place to strengthen the service being offered. It comes after Elaine Douglas called the helpline this week when she was told by Dan#s school to contact their GP after he displayed symptoms of a cold. Dan#s father Dougie Douglas said: The helpline said get him out of school, get him home and put him in isolation and phone us back when you#ve done that.Mrs Douglas said the helpline advised her to undertake measures including: Keeping her -year-old son in his room while the rest of the family were asked to isolate themselves in their house Serve Dan his food on paper plates with plastic cutlery to be disposed of in a strong plastic bin bagNot to take anything out of his room for a period of two weeks Make sure Dan only used one bathroom, not to be used by the rest of the family Dan should clean his room with antiseptic spray every couple of hours To clean every handle he uses Speaking while her son was in isolation, Mrs Douglas said: I phoned back the helpline this morning to say he doesn#t have the symptoms they#ve listed on the website. Because he had a headcold, they said he has to [stay in isolation]. She said it would get a lot worse very quickly Dougie DouglasI assumed somebody would come out and test him but the helpline said just to monitor his condition andit gets worse call . She said it would get a lot worse very quickly.Mrs Douglas said she asked for her details to be passed on to a surveillance team but hadn#t heard anything from any public health body. She said she feared the public stigma around the virus. We live in a development and there are lots of neighbours and we don#t want people to say that#s the house that has coronavirus.Teenager Dan said he was bored in his room but that he understood the measures that were being taken. It#s for the safety of everyone  around me. People in school are making these  rumours about me being in hospital and that and it#s sort of worrying when I go to school, that people are going to look at me in a dferent way.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home Dan DouglasSpeaking of his experience in Italy, he said: When we landed, the towns around where we were staying were put in lockdown, which made everyone worried and wary of the people around them. You saw how many people were wearing a mask.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home.But when he went back to school, he had a runny nose so went to the nurse to get medication. I went to the nurse to get paracetamol and she told me to make sure I binned the tissue when I sneezed and cleaned my hands.I went home and did my homework that night and then out of nowhere I got taken away.On Wednesday, after Dan had spent two days in isolation, the Douglas family received a call from Dr Philip Veal of the PHA who told them they had been given the wrong information. Mrs Douglas said: I#m relieved we can have our le back and we#re not going to have to spend two weeks in the house. I was more concerned that my son as going to be in a shoebox of a bedroom with all his food rubbish and waste in a black bag for two weeks.Mr Douglas added it was a real relief that the information around the coronavirus had been claried. I didn#t really know what to do and I didn#t feel the information we were given was enough. They didn#t even ask for our address, even for somebody to speak to my son.Mrs Douglas said she would advise anyone with any doubts to phone the PHA directly and not to use the helpline. Dr Philip Veal of the PHA said he was surprised to hear the family had been given incorrect advice and that the agency was keen to send the right message to the public. We very much regret and apologise to the family for the inconvenience and discomfort this has caused them, he said. At the moment what we#re doing is asking people have they travelled to an area where there has been a spread of coronavirus andthey have associated symptoms like a cold or shortness of breath to make contact with their GP.Dr Veal said the PHA has taken steps to bring the situation under control following this incident. We#ve improved our quality assurance measures around the advice given, for example regular reviewing of the scripting given to the helpline, twice daily contact with the call line handlers to give them support and a direct line of contact with us should they need further advice. The coronavirus is a fast moving situation and new areas of concern are constantly evolving. We#re constantly working to update and sometimes when the information goes out there can be a lag, he said.

It is a fluid situation but obviously there are people going to Italy who are concerned. Tour operators and airlines are working closely with the Foreign Office. If people want to change or cancel their holidays, fees are still in place. Some airlines are a little more lenient than others when it comes to changes but that would fall under normal ticketing regulations anyway, she said. We are recommending that people take out adequate travel insurance that covers them when it comes to disruption. The majority of people who would book through us would have chosen an inclusive package which means they are fully protected, in the case of not being allowed to travel to a certain area with a tour operators I would be giving a full refund or helping them find an alternative. The majority of people are looking at it as they still want to get away to the sun and they realise in relation to the size of the population there#s a very small number of people being affected - the elderly or those with an underlying medical condition. Generally speaking we#re finding bookings are still coming through and people are still prepared to travel, it#s not a problem. – Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says that based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and that those who have died in Wuhan appeared to have pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said that about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added that older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandCoronavirus: Apology after Northern Ireland family told to isolate for fortnight by Public Health AgencyThe Public Health Agencyhas apologised to a Northern Ireland family after they were advised to isolate themselves in their home after their son ed from an Italian ski trip. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus in Northern Ireland to be classed as #notiable disease# - allowing legally-compelled testingStormont#s health committee has agreed to classy coronavirus as a notiable disease, which would allow a judge to legally compel someone suspected of having the disease to undergo medical testing.Northern IrelandGoods made in China are running low in Northern Ireland shops due to coronavirus Supplies of Chinese-made consumer goods, such as curtains and sofas, are expected to run low in shops here due to factory shutdowns triggered by coronavirus.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadThreats against Regent House pupils over #repulsive# video mocking Down#s syndromeFrantic search for anyone tied to Northern Ireland#s first case of coronavirusAlliance Party rake in most donations with £kLarge number of hatchets and knives seized after disturbance at Strabane funeralBody recovered from sea at Antrim village,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The five-piece are ing to An Carn after playing there last year, and band member Gerry McNeill is looking forward to their . “It was fantastic and we are buzzing to be back again, he told the County Derry Post. “We loved the theatre – the tiered seating, us on the floor – and the banter with the audience was brilliant.” The gig is the fourth of the band’s latest tour, having already played dates in Omagh and Belfast, and comes hot on the heels of their planned Portaferry gig this Friday night. googletag.cmd.push Fans of the band will be delighted to hear that there is some new material in the pipeline. “There will be three or four new songs that haven’t been recorded yet,” says the singer. “They can expect the old favourites - we have four albums to choose from – but during rehearsals, we were picking out songs we hadn’t done in about five years or so. “It’s good to resurrect songs that we’ve neglected because you can get into a routine of doing the same kind of set for a while.” The Rapparees have been together over  years, but have retained four of the band’s five original members – Kevin Mawdsley, Joe McKeague, Conor McCaffrey and Gerry – while also adding Belfast man Stephen Flanagan to the line-up. googletag.cmd.push Their original audience has grown up alongside the band, but Gerry says it has broadened its appeal in both directions over the years – even adding local celebrities to their growing list of followers. “The last gig at Duncairn was great, because Barra Best was in the audience and tweeting clips of the gig! “Those people our own age have stayed with us, but we’ve started to appeal to a younger and also an older audience. “The good thing about playing traditional music is that you have that wide range of appeal and the age group is ied. With four albums already under their belts, the lads have built up a healthy repertoire of songs, but plans are underway for a fth album this year. Gerry says the tour is an ideal sounding board for new material. “The best way to try these out is to practise it, try it live andthey go down well, then you know it’s a goer. “It’s hard to get everyone together with everyone’s busy schedule but we’re looking into a few older Clancy Brothers songs while trying to keep a modern twist. “And also,we try to start writing stuff again, that would be good too.” For now, the focus is on this weekend’s gig in An Carn, but anyone misty-eyed for the raucous nights at the Hatfield may have to curb their enthusiasm. “For theatre gigs, everything has to be the finished product,” says Gerry. “You can’t be going on singing too many rowdy Pogues songs – but we love being able to do both settings.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Housing Executive said it is not in a position to provide exact dates for each as they are dependent on available finance.The news has been welcomed by SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan.He said: “This will be welcome news for many Creggan NIHE tenants, many of whom contacted my office with concerns about the poor conditions of existing windows.“The need for such a scheme has been glaringly apparent with many windows in these homes losing a great deal of heat and experiencing rot. This essential replacement scheme is a long time coming but I’m glad the Housing Executive have confirmed that it is coming.“I have been advised that works will begin as early as Spring  and that homes included in this initial roll-out will have already received consultation correspondence.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster Universityhas also confirmed that steps are being mapped out before any decision is made on the relocation of health science courses. Figures obtained by the Derry News by way of a Freedom of Informationrequest, after UU refused to provide them, show that student numbers have dropped from , in   to , in   - that is both full-time and part-time students. At Coleraine, numbers have dropped from , in   to , this year. It means that since   student numbers at Magee have decreased by . googletag.cmd.push The proposed graduate entry medical schoolat the Derry campus is projected to have  students in  enrolments begin next year as envisaged. Derry representatives have insisted that Health Science courses, such as physiotherapy and radiotherapy, from Jordanstown be transferred to the city to complement the GEMS. Those courses would attract approximately , students over time and are viewed as pivotal in the push towards the desired , students. However, all options remain on the table and the courses could end up in Coleraine or the new Belfast campus. An Ulster University spokesperson said: “The University has gathered feedback from a range of stakeholders on the future location of its health sciences courses. googletag.cmd.push “The next steps in the process to reach a fully informed final decision will be confirmed shortly.” Last week the Department for the Economy said “no funding” has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. At the end of January, DfE announced that it was committed to delivering expansion of the Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. At the same meeting, senior DfE officials declared that UU’s business case for Magee expansion was out of date and “new money” was needed – an outcome the official said was “hard to see happening.” A spokesperson for the Derry University Group commented: “This is a point of crisis. Commitments given to the North West in the Stormont Programme for Governmenthave clearly been broken by Belfast. “The political will shown by the two governments in New Decade, New Approach, has not been reciprocated by the new administration here. “This will have seriously damaging effects on the North West’s already-broken Higher Education sector and a devastating impact on the region’s faltering economy.” He continued: “The generosity shown by the North West’s main political parties in re-establishing partnerships under New Decade, New Approach has been abused, very cynically – as has Council’s relationship with Ulster University. “The two governments, and our local public representatives, cannot afford to wait any longer while the Greater Belfast Lobby bankrupts another administration. They must act immediately in the interests of the North West by overturning off-the-books bailout of UU and Belfast, and by insisting on the full implementation of the original PfG.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A row of terraced houses at Wapping Lane, close to the Fountain estate, have lain empty for a considerable number of years. Those properties are amongst , that are sitting empty across the Derry and Strabane council area. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive , says empty properties are a “wasted resource” for the owner and those looking for somewhere to live. “Vacant homes can deteriorate and become a nuisance for people living close by. They may also lead to neighbourhood decline,” NIHE added. googletag.cmd.push Potential benefits of bringing an empty home back into use include generating rental income to offset rates and the costs of maintaining the property, releasing capital from the sale of the property and protecting the long-term investment potential of the property. In addition, it reduces the risk of vandalism, squatting and anti-social behaviour, and liability for health and safety issues, or damage to adjoining properties. When planning permission was granted to convert the iconic former Sinclair factory building on Abercorn Road into  apartments, the proposal also involved the conversion of seven vacant terraced dwellings along Wapping Lane into  apartments. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, told the Derry News that it is vitally important to develop this street. “I do want to see this area developed, it is my personal preference that they be kept as houses because I’d like to see more families move in to reinvigorate the area. In conversations I’ve had with the developer they have been positive about the possibility of houses. “I know parking was an issue, but I would encourage the developer to work as quickly as possible as it is in their interest to see them developed also.” The Foyle MLA said that homelessness figures show the need for housing in the city. “You don’t want to see any area sitting in derelictionit can be avoided. “It would also bring development of the streetscape which would complement the work that has already been done on the Abercorn Road – Wapping Lane needs to be part of that. “It would avoid problems with anti-social behaviour and environmental issues which have emerged while the properties have been vacant.” People Before Profit Councillor for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, said it is “unacceptable” for so many houses to remain unoccupied. He believes that many housing units are being “turned over to Air BB” to take advantage of busy periods in the Derry calendar. It proves a lucrative business for property owners, he said, and means they don’t feel the need to let them out for the rest of the year. Cllr McCann is of the view that Stormont must implement a “crash programme” of house building for the Derry area and NI as a whole. “There is a serious shortage of housing, particularly rental properties for young people.” He suggested giving the Housing Executive powers to build again by using the , properties in its ownership as collateral to borrow money against. Councillor McCann supported development at Wapping Lane, adding: “The need for housing is as great as it was  years ago. Derry was the spark for progressive movements in the past and it must be again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day, on the bill there’s the Henry Girls, Blackbird and Crow, Reevah, Blood, Great White Lies and Tara Gi with comperes for the evening, Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, and ending the night with some tunes from The Stray Kitten. All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March , but before that, there are several events, some flying the flag for the women and others are just dirty garage punks who should know better.The former includes Louise DaCosta, the one-woman army making everyone take notice of her skills producing electro music. It’s been a whole year since I spoke to her about setting up her own label and got another chat to her this week… googletag.cmd.push Womens Day coming up, how are things in electronicland for women behind the decks  “Things are definitely evolving in the music scene. “There are certainly more women getting involved. “Even from our workshops theres much more interest in ladies from all ages, long overdue, but its brilliant to see and be part of the #equalisingmusic campaign.” Are there other women dj-ing you like  “Of course, too many to mention. However, there are a few emerging acts that have come through the ranks at our courses. “I’m excited to watch their progress and looking forward to seeing them smash it at our label party. “Don’t want to make any names just yet...but keep an eye on our posters and events for some super next generation talent.” googletag.cmd.push Youre the brains behind a record label, no easy job, how has that been  “Honestly its been great. Delighted to be working with so many talented artists from all over Ireland and across the world. “We’ve signed over  artists, with our focus on pushing homegrown talent, but we’ve also welcomed established and emerging artists from USA, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Malaysia, Serbia and India. “Initially, I had a three-year plan, but we accomplished all that and more within the first year... which was a pleasant surprise to say the least! “Selling out our label party events across the country, consistent radio play, hitting multiple charts with our tracks and almost  releases out within the first  months.” What have you lined up for this year  “Lots of label party events lined up nationwide as well as across the water.“Currently working with Arts Council, Blubell and ious groups delivering DJ skills digital workshops across the North West. As well as all the usual touring, looking forward to heading out to the Far East again through the year and playing across Ireland, Scotland etc. “Obviously, the big one this weekend DaCosta Records first birthday and looking forward to headlining Holi Colours Festival next month. My new track, Mermaid, is out th February.”Celtronic is  this year…. “Fantastic to see a local brand not only endure but go from strength to strength. “Long may it continue, more power to them.” What would you tell young women starting out  “Don’t be afraid to get involved. Go to a workshop, got to a course, go to events. “If you’re not invited to the party, then start your own. “Appreciate your local scene, learn and develop there. Be it, own it, do it!.” The latter obviously refers to New York’s Daddy Long Legs making a welcometo Derry this Friday night in Sandino’s. They’re the citys most beloved blues bashers have been huffing and puffing and blowing houses down on a nightly basis, on their infinite world tour and always bring an elevated level of rough and ready intensity to contemporary lo-fi blues, with their explosive fire ceremony. A Daddy Long Legs show is equal parts roots rock, blues and guttural soul, stripping down old standards and making them shiny and new again. Some of the originals are like an all-out spiritual revival, while others are hauntingly beautul. Also, on the bill are Protex, a Belfast punk band which formed in . Their first records were issued on Good Vibrations records. They formed part of the first wave of Belfast punk bands along with the likes of label-mates The Undertones and Rudi. Tickets are pound and can be acquired from Eventbrite. Asthat wasn’t enough, Stefan Murphy will be playing another intimate gig in the Grand Central this Saturday. If you were there for the last one you don’t need reminding of how special it was,you weren’t, he kicks off at ten on Saturday and it’s free.

You should never, ever accept defeat.“If youre able to show that comebackability youre never dead You saw it last year when we were away to Dundalk and away to Shamrock Rovers when it looked aswe were down and out but we came back. Theres that fighting spirit. “Its also got to do with the people who come off the bench. Its about making positive changes to try and get you back in the game. Its all down to the players and their appetite to not want to lose games. You would think thats a gimme in football but its not and were very proud that here we dont accept defeat and we keep going to the very last seconds of the game.”Despite last weeks game against Harps being televised, the Brandywell was packed to capacity and the supporters who stayed until the very end got their reward of a late goal. On reflection, Devine believes that the new players at the club may have been slightly overawed at their first experience of thousands of City fans cheering them on.“These bunch of players back themselves, they are good players,” he continued. “It was a wee bit of a culture shock for them seeing the crowd and the appetite and the expectation last Friday night but Im definitely sure that they will be ready for it this week. “The players were absolutely devastated that the game at St. Pats was called off because they were all going there confident.” googletag.cmd.push SignicantBoth Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers won on Monday night, maintaining their % starts to the new campaign. Bohs, who finished just ahead of Derry in third place last season, have also had a decent start, winning two from three. A win at the Brandywell would create a signicant gap between the two sides just a few weeks into the season, something which Devine is aware of.“These are the days in the season where we are all finding our way,” he said. “We have to make sure that we improve week by week and we cant wait for the games to come because the games are the biggest teacher. They show us what teams are right, what players are right, what formations are right. “The games will hopefully come thick and fast and hopefully we can start putting points on the board.“I dont think that anyone is ever going to be too concerned in the opening round of matches. Weve had a narrow defeat to Dundalk and weve drawn a Northwest derby so I dont think theres anything overly concerning at this moment in time.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Brandywell was packed with fans celebrating that equaliser with him and Liddle admits it was a special night for him. “Im surprised how many people come down to these games,” he said. “The games are brilliant to play in and the league is brilliant. The crowd was great, you cant hear anything on the pitch which is something Ive never experienced before. “I love it here. I think its very competitive, its tough and I think its just a great place to come and get some first team experience.”Now Liddle is hoping that his goal against Finn Harps is the start of good times to come in a red and white shirt.“I’m absolutely delighted to come here and score on my home debut, getting the equaliser in the last minute, is brilliant,” he said. “I was itching to get on just to show what I can do and hopefully this goal will help me to continue to show people what I can do.Having started the  campaign against champions Dundalk before facing Ollie Horgan’s men last Friday evening, Liddle already knows the le in the League of Ireland is going to be tough, having been thrown in at the deep end.“The first two games have been tough,” he admitted. “Obviously we know that this league isn’t easy and to be honest every game we play we think is going to be tough for us, so we just have to take each game as they come and hopefully grind out results.”The -year-old is already a fan of team-mate Walter Figueira for his late equaliser, after the ex-Waterford man showed great skill to create the chance. “I saw him do a lovely piece of skill and get to the byline and I was thinking to get a little bit of movement so that he could cut it back, then I was just thinking to make sure I would get as much connect on it as possible and lucky for me it went in. It was brilliant to go over and celebrate with the fans.” googletag.cmd.push More paceMeanwhile, Declan Devine wants his players to show more pace in their build up play when they face Bohemians tomorrow night. City were lethargic at times against Harps last week and, to an extant, played into their opponents hands. “I think we were slow in our build up play last Friday night, theres no doubt about it, but thats credit to Finn Harps as well as they made it really dficult,” he explained. “We wanted to work down the sides of them and create overloads, but that didnt materialise and I think we got into a bit of a rut in terms of playing slowly, which suited Harps. “That said, I have to give the players massive credit because into a gale-force wind we were the dominant team and we kept going. The keeper has made a great save before Adam scored and we hit the bar. It was so, so dficult to keep the ball down and play through, but to be fair to the players they kept plugging and kept plugging and I think rightly so deserved their equaliser.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst

Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

Leviticus : says to afflict your soulsIt is clear that Jesus commended fasting when speaking to the disciples’ I would never discourage fasting, but only the religious concepts applied to it, such as the ‘Lenten denial’ that Mr Hardy says is a feature of Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant groups and traditions. It is still man made traditions that Jesus said make the Word of God of none effect.Letter to the editor \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In Matthew  He warns not to ‘be like the hypocrites ... but when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to be fasting, but to your Father’. In the Land of Israel there is a national annual fast for  hours on the Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, where the whole country comes to a standstill, with no shops or restaurants open, television andradio not broadcast, and even no cars on any roads.This is one example of ‘when’ people fast, and not ‘’.Lent, despite the fact that Jesus never instructed us to copy His suffering and temptation, is much more a ‘token’ fast, often with skipping a meal, giving up chocolate, cigarettes or alcohol, as opposed to the Biblical examples of abstaining completely from food and water for an extended time. Leviticus : says to ‘afflict your souls’.What other nation on earth, other than Israel, honours God on such a national scale, or on an annual basis, unless they are going through some major crisis, such as was the case of national prayer in the UK during WWII  There were still cars on the road however! Lent may expiate the soul for those who find it beneficial, but unlike in Leviticus, we are not commanded to keep ‘Lent’ by God or Jesus.In the case of the epileptic boy’s healing in Matthew  Jesus informs the disciples that their lack of a result was because “this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting,” which demonstrates that there often has to be a practical reason for fasting and not just by habit.Colin Nevin, Bangor "},{"url":null,"title":"united unionist convention not what unionism needs time ","story":"Seven men arrested by PSNI investigating rape allegationNI snow alert worse than originally thought - Met Office issue second NI weather warning within  hoursNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionLettersA United Unionist Convention is not what unionism needs at this timeThe loyalist Billy Hutchinson has proposed a United Unionist Convention.By The NewsroomThursday, th February , : pm\"\"Billy Hutchinson, second from left, and other loyalist and unionist leaders at he Unionist Forum, set up in  due to the loyalist flag protestsBut that is what we always did, back in the day, and it is way too late for that. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It just doesn’t bear thinking about.”A spokesperson for the Education Authority commented: “We can confirm we are investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident on a contracted private hire route involving a pupil attending Edenderry Primary School on Wednesday  February .“On becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action as the safety and well-being of pupils is our primary concern.“We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and have offered our unreserved apology to the pupil and their parents.“As this matter is under investigation no further comment can be made as it may be prejudicial to the process.”Edenderry School Principal Stephen Doyle commented: “We are very concerned about thischild being left on the bus.“We have asked the Education Authority on behalf of the Board of Governors to investigate the matter.” left alone on school bus for hours\" data-s-urlclick\" news autistic-boy--left-alone-school-bus-hours-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\"Autistic boyleft alone on school bus for hours\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" left alone on school bus for hours\" data-s-urlclick\" news autistic-boy--left-alone-school-bus-hours-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" left alone on school bus for hours\" data-s-urlclick\" news autistic-boy--left-alone-school-bus-hours-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\"Autistic boyleft alone on school bus for hours\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" left alone on school bus for hours\" data-s-urlclick\" news autistic-boy--left-alone-school-bus-hours-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Whatsapp\" data-param-text\"Autistic boyleft alone on school bus for hours https:www.portadowntimes news autistic-boy--left-alone-school-bus-hours-\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience. In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland.
