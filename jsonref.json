The photographs, captured by photographer and explorer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, from Rome, Italy, only hint to the New Guinea tribe\u0027s dark, violent history (Pictured: Young members of the Asmat tribe)         The Asmat people spent centuries hunting down their enemies and removing their heads, sometimes transforming their decapitated skulls into pillows (Pictured: A child in a sea shell hat)         The tribe is said to have \u0027officially\u0027 turned its back on headhunting in the 1990s in favour of a quieter, more peaceful life of woodcarving and creating \u0027legendary\u0027 handicrafts         \u0027I have always really wanted to go to Papua, in particular the Asmat area,\u0027 said Mr Chiodini, who works as a manager for an energy company\u0027Asmat handicraft is legendary of course and a big reason for my visit. Another was the beautiful body and facial decorations on display but most of all I yearned to explore a tribe which is close to world limits\u0027.The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000.  This represents the needs and interests of the tribe, and promotes self-reliance, self-governance, and sustainable economic development.The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller, who was the son of then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.              The tribe, which still remains relatively isolated from the modern world, formed a community organisation, the Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat, in 2000 (Left: A group of tribesmen and right: sacred wooden masks)         The tribe did not only hunt for skulls but also worshipped them, and believed that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him         The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body\u0027You really need to want to go to Asmat, because it takes several days to get there, you need to sleep in tents in their longhouse, to navigate in narrow rivers and they are not that friendly\u0027, said Mr Chiodini.\u0027I knew the Rockefeller story before I got there, I was also a little bit scared because you cannot know what you will face when you arrive in the area.\u0027Officially headhunting ceased in the 1990s. What I can say is that Asmat are relatively isolated and their most important cultural traditions are still strong - you can feel it as you explore the area.\u0027The tribe did not only hunt for skulls, they also worshipped them. The heads of the deceased were stripped of the brain and the eyes and nasal parts were closed up in order to prevent evil spirits to enter or exit the body.          Two Asmat tribesmen exhale smoke in a small hut while wearing elaborately decorated feathered hats and body paint         Children were also covered in white paint within the tribe, which became infamous for its headhunting practices in the 20th century         Dozens of tribesmen sit crossed legged for a community meeting of the Asmat people, some with white paint across their bodies and heads         A group of tribesmen head across the coastal waters of Papua on their own hand-hewn canoes near to the isolated village         The Asmat people became infamous in 1961 after they were accused of the murder of Michael Rockefeller (Pictured in New Guinea)Skulls that were modified and decorated were then displayed by the Asmat in an honourable place in their homes. The tribe were said to believe that when they killed a man and ate him, they took his power and became him.Each of the thousands of tribesmen was named after someone deceased, or after a killed enemy. It is, however, believed headhunting ceased in the 1990s when Catholic missionaries suppressed the practice.          Pictured: Italian photographer Gianluca Chiodini, 41, who captured the striking photographsTheir biggest alleged scalp was Rockefeller, who had been exploring New Guinea in 1961 in search of treasures to bring home and put on display in New York City.He visited Asmat during the trip - a region he described as \u0027wild and somehow more remote country than what I have ever seen before\u0027 - where he had a pragmatic relationship with the local tribes. But as his boat approached what is now Papua New Guinea on November 19, a sudden gust of wind churned the water and capsized Rockefeller\u0027s boat. Despite being 10 miles from dry land, he attempted to swim to shore.In 2014, Carl Hoffman, a reporter for National Geographic, alleged in his book Savage Harvest that he believed Rockefeller was murdered and eaten by the Asmat people. According to years of research, the Oil Standard heir had managed to make it back to the island but was confronted by a bank of Asmat tribespeople who were fishing the waters.But the tale didn\u0027t stop Mr Chiodini from visiting the area. The photographer recalls speaking to the tribal elders, who were old enough to have partaken in their tribe\u0027s history of cannibalism and headhunting, and being distracted by the notion as he asked the ancient warriors to pose for a photo.\u0027Being able to capture people in their environment and show what life is like in these places is a big part of what I enjoy about travel photography,\u0027 he said.\u0027In other worlds, connecting with locals, even if sometimes just with non-verbal language.

Interview by Felix PettyMy first game at White Hart Lane was Tottenham v Wimbledon on Saturday 10 November 1990. We won the game 4–2. I sat in Park Lane watching a Spurs side featuring Gazza, Lineker, Mabbutt, Walsh … But my love for Tottenham started long before that. We all have our stories as to why we support the club. Mine might be a little different to most, having grown up in Denmark.The first ever game I remember watching on TV was the 1978 World Cup final between Argentina and Holland. I was six years old and watched the game with my parents. I remember taking an instant liking to the Argentina kits, the blue and white stripes and the black shorts. I was blown away by the atmosphere and celebrations and instantly fell in love with football. After that summer I started following the English games on TV and as the recent World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa had signed for Spurs, I decided Tottenham was going to be my team. I watched as many games as I could on TV before I finally moved to London in 1993 and was from then on finally able to visit White Hart Lane on a regular basis.I’ve been supporting Tottenham most of my life and seen us in good and bad times. Seen players and managers come and go, and it can be frustrating, even heartbreaking, when they leave for another team. Sometimes it can feel like there’s little loyalty in football. One day you are Spurs, the next day you can go play for a rival. The focus is always on the players and the manager. I was interested in making a project about the fans. The fans never switch allegiances, they are here forever and I felt that needed to be documented and celebrated.I started bringing my camera to the games and photographed the atmosphere on the streets and in the pubs before and after. It ended up growing into an obsession, and after three years I realised that I was beginning to document a piece of our history – the last seasons at White Hart Lane. I decided that our last game at White Hart Lane should be the endpoint of this project. I went to, and photographed, over 100 home and away games between 2013 and 2017.I wanted to capture different generations of fans, the camaraderie, the banter, the songs in the pubs, the madness. Travelling up and down the country and the long away trips in Europe. I wasn’t interested in making a chronological “football fan” book covering all the games with numerous pictures on each page. I wanted the book to have some artistic merit in terms of photography. I am interested in people and I’ve always been more interested in photography that is open-ended, pictures that are suggestive and open to interpretation, rather than pictures that are descriptive.The Arsenal derbies are always memorable, something every fan looks forward to. It’s an early start and you can feel the tension and excitement in the atmosphere all over north London. I also used to love the trips to Upton Park, which are now sadly also part of history. The European away trips are fantastic. There is something special about going abroad with Tottenham. Being in a different country, putting our flags and banners up and taking over a pub with all the familiar faces. The last game at White Hart Lane was emotional and beautiful. When we beat Manchester City away in 2016, when Eriksen scored the winner in the 83rd minute, and of course our 3-1 win against Real Madrid at Wembley, these were all very special moments.There’s something about going to all those games, travelling home and away, which forms bonds between people, and over the past five years I have met so many fantastic characters and heard many Tottenham stories. There is something fascinating about meeting and talking to lifelong fans, those who have been there since the glory days – there’s a real link to the history of the club in their memories. It’s important to memorialise that.I was interested in capturing characters, emotions and expressions and also the dynamics of the group. I kept an instinctive approach throughout and often shot from the hip. Nothing was planned or staged. It was all about capturing those little moments – a feeling that could so often get lost if I’d spent time framing the shots.It definitely helped being a Spurs boy, but you don’t just turn up and get invited in and start taking pictures. In the beginning there were certainly a few people who questioned what I was doing pointing a camera in their face. I knew from the beginning that I had to take my time. It was important for me to get to know people first, find out what they are doing and just go with the flow. It might sound like a cliché, but you can’t make images happen when you want them to – the images will come to you. It’s a little bit like fishing – sometimes you catch something and sometimes you come home empty-handed.I like using my camera as a tool to meet other people. It can help break down boundaries. I always treat everyone with respect – if they didn’t want to be photographed I wouldn’t photograph them. I am always modest and interested in what other people are doing and thinking. I take better pictures when I feel a connection with others. Once you are accepted and you are part of the same dynamic you feel that you belong to something special and it becomes easier to take pictures.Can’t Smile Without You by Martin Andersen is published by AMS and available at https:www.shop.martinandersenproductscant-smile-without-you.

The gentleman in the foreground, Joe Wrenn, organises this group ride every fall in the hilly terrain to the north of the Mississippi delta. I’ve been going for a few years.Trail rides are universal in the American cowboy tradition. In other states you might find thousands of people on a single ride. Here there were about 100 people, many riding, and others, who you can’t see in the photo, on dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles.Most of the delta region is completely flat. Up here, though, are rolling hills, which is where the group gets its name. The ride wasn’t following a trail – part of it was along an old logging road. We had all stopped for a break. People were relaxing, playing music and then, when we started back out, Joe drove the truck up alongside these three horses. I shot I don’t know how many frames. I remember feeling so excited at getting both Joe and the kids on their horses silhouetted against that beautiful, late-afternoon sun bursting through. That is Joe’s grandson on the first horse.Elsewhere, I have photographed a great-grandmother who had just turned 92 – her husband, now deceased, was one of the first cowboys to start organising these rides in the delta. And I’ve photographed little kids, maybe four or five, riding around a horse show.Being a Delta Hill Rider is like being a member of a biker club. They have been riding horses for generations, and they take great pride in passing down the skills – riding, grooming, competing – from one generation to the next. The riders go to R\u0026ampB clubs dressed as cowboys and the DJ will play cowboy songs and zydeco music.My interest started by chance, in December 2016, when I was working as staff photographer at the university in Cleveland, Mississippi. I stumbled across a small group of riders during the annual parade and asked one of the riders if I could come and photograph where they keep their horses. He was excited that somebody was taking an interest. He invited me to a Black Heritage rodeo, which was happening the following month.Meeting the Delta Hill Riders has been life-changing. I grew up in Maine, in a place that was not erse. This was the first time in my life that I developed a deep connection with the African American community. I am really grateful for that. I feel like, if people made the time to get to know neighbours who were different from them, it would relieve a lot of the tension and isive thinking that we have.Trained: Journalism at St Michael’s College, Vermont.High point: “The excitement of getting my first magazine assignment.

It’s bordering on heresy even to ask this question, let alone to suggest that six manic weeks of battle buses and TV debates and leaflets destined only for the recycling bin might not be worth the millions they cost. So we political junkies carry on parsing every throwaway remark for meaning, obsessing over every stunt and gaffe, searching for that one mythical moment that will in retrospect seem to have changed everything. If nothing else, it’s comforting to think there must be some kind of logic to it.Most startlingly of all, a recent review of dozens of campaign field experiments led by the US political scientists Joshua Kalla and David Broockman concluded that the average effect of campaign contacts and advertising on US voters was precisely … zero.Campaigning isn’t completely pointless, of course. It’s great at reminding people there’s an election on, which pushes the committed out to vote. Candidates taking “unusually unpopular positions” have an impact too, according to Kalla and Broockman, which helps explain why in 2017 Theresa May’s lead collapsed after she published her social care proposals. But campaigning is bad at changing minds, with their study estimating that at best it may convert around one in 800 voters. Broadly speaking, we all put far too much weight on what happens in the six weeks before an election and not enough on the long-term trends shaping the previous five years.Why are people in coalfield communities once devastated by the miners’ strike surprising even themselves by considering voting Tory? Why did Labour do unexpectedly well in Canterbury last time? And why is the Surrey commuter belt now flirting with the Liberal Democrats? Of course this topsy-turvy election can’t be reduced to any one single factor. But a surprisingly unexamined driver is demographics. It’s a well-worn truth both that Britain is ageing, and that older people are more likely than younger ones to vote Conservative. But it isn’t ageing uniformly, and in a general election that matters.As the thinktank Centre for Towns pointed out in a report on ageing last year that deserved more attention than it got, the populations of many of the so-called “red wall” towns across the north and Midlands, where Labour is under siege from the Tories, are ageing faster than average.Young people move away to work or study in the big city and don’t come back, because they see fewer prospects for them back in Grimsby or Ashfield or Bolsover. A vicious spiral can set in, where an exodus of bright young people leads to a declining skills base in their old home towns companies become reluctant to invest there, creating even fewer reasons for the next generation to stay. Big cities are getting younger, and southern towns are ageing roughly in line with national trends. But many of the smaller towns that Boris Johnson must win to get a majority are quietly haemorrhaging the age group most likely to vote Labour, and becoming dominated by a more hostile one, while younger people’s votes pile up in the big cities where Labour was already strong.This isn’t just about pensioners’ greater tendency to have backed Brexit, either. These are sweeping generalisations with many inidual exceptions, but older people tend to hold socially conservative attitudes on issues such as immigration and defence pensioners have been relatively shielded too from the long post-crash squeeze on wages and working-age benefits, at least compared to the young. And voters who remember the hard left in the 1980s may be more sceptical about Corbynomics than those to whom it’s new and exciting. Brexit has driven a new wedge between Labour and its former heartlands, but the truth is they’ve been growing apart for years, in ways not easily reversed by last-minute offers of free broadband.In the south, meanwhile, human geography plays out very differently. Places such as Canterbury became richer pickings for Labour in 2017, just as Cheltenham and Guildford are now for the Lib Dems, at least partly because these towns are changing as 30-something professionals find themselves priced out of London. Young families seeking somewhere affordable to live have spread first to the outer suburbs and then beyond, across Surrey and Gloucestershire and Kent and Sussex, bringing socially liberal attitudes and frustration with the economic status quo into once sleepy market towns and villages. (If the Canterbury effect isn’t working for Labour as it did in 2017, that’s perhaps because the Lib Dems are more competitive this time around among these mainly remain-leaning voters.)As the Centre for Towns report stresses, demographics can’t explain everything they’re just part of a bewildering jumble of social and economic changes, some pulling the result one way and others another. But the pattern it identifies suggests the Tories should be closing the gap in northern towns while Labour should be piling up votes in cities such as Bristol, which is indeed what we saw in 2017. What drives elections may not always be iniduals changing their minds, but places slowly changing over the years as a consequence of decisions both politicians and voters have often unwittingly made.Old habits die hard, so knowing all this won’t stop us political junkies obsessing over every moment of the last few days. Nor is it to denigrate the heroic efforts of people out knocking on doors in the freezing cold and dark, each time hoping this conversation is the one that makes the difference.But elections are won in the years leading up to them, not the weeks. This time more than ever it’s hard to shake the feeling that the letter is already in the post, even if nobody yet knows what it says that all we’re really doing, in these last frantic days, is keeping busy until we can open it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b7accfd8ccae8bf383f7dd193996f8fc5e30b8c/86_481_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd3fe658de485aefb4554d79d0e725b","title":"polls election ethnic minority voters black asian scottish lib dem","story":"What would happen if all the analysis of this election omitted Scotland? Or if the polls that increasingly inform our understanding and analysis of politics decided it wasn’t worth examining the views of those aged 18-24? How about if journalists decided that they should ignore Liberal Democrat supporters, irrelevant as we know how they’re going to vote? There would be some outrage, surely.Yet there is a glaring absence in our existing political analysis: ethnicity. This despite the fact that there are more ethnic minority voters than Scottish voters, Liberal Democrat voters, or 18 to 24-year-old voters. In an election where tactical voting is widespread, such polls and reporting may even be shaping how people vote.For example, even the best polling from the 2017 election, YouGov’s MRP model, which alone predicted a hung parliament, still underestimated the Labour vote share in the constituencies with the most ethnic minority voters. While this didn’t affect any inidual seat calls, it did suggest that seats were more marginal in places such as Battersea and Edmonton than results indicated.If we are to solve this problem, polling companies must do a better job of collecting data on ethnicity. It’s true that sampling ethnic minorities would be costly, but it’s also true that private companies are paying millions of pounds to Britain’s pollsters, and that those pollsters are influencing the nature of our democracy, and whose voices and interests count most. With ethnicity such a strong predictor of vote choice, the current lack of ethnicity breaks is increasingly indefensible.But even if the pollsters continue to drag their feet, journalists need to improve their understanding of race and ethnicity in Britain today. We can see the low level of interest in the way that racism is discussed generally, as an attribute of iniduals, or as part of a sensationalist story about celebrities, rather than as a systemic or institutional issue with deep historical roots in our society. Where are the vox pops with young black voters? Where are the editorials about the “genuine concerns” of Asian working-class men?This is both a question of basic data, but perhaps more importantly about understanding the nature of ethnic minority communities in today’s Britain, and of racism. Even without data we have no shortage of journalists touring the country and meeting voters, but there’s been little curiosity about ethnic minorities and their views about Brexit, racism, the NHS or the economy – or anything much at all.Ethnic minorities in Britain are well aware that their voices are not heard. They see it every day on their televisions and in their workplaces. The current weakness of our political analysis of race and ethnicity in Britain isn’t just a failure of research or political analysis. It’s a failure of equal representation in our democracy.• Omar Khan is director of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb93006fbf9b742f0b6ee69b760334c04c19df24/580_727_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cad28e7e1d64955e6a1cc51b4891719","title":"science museum hiding dirty money over 2m sackler donation","story":"Funds intended for specific project will instead be spread across Science Museum’s workThe Science Museum has been accused of trying to “quietly hide away dirty money” after it agreed to a request by the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation to repurpose a £2m donation earmarked for a prominent new gallery.The donation, which was meant to fund the Medicine: the Wellcome Galleries collection – dedicated to thousands of medical artefacts, including the world’s first MRI scanner– was removed from the project earlier this year as the Sacklers’ philanthropic donations came under increased scrutiny.In 2017, the Science Museum announced that the galleries would have two new key funders: GSK and The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. But when the galleries opened in November this year there was no mention of the Sacklers on its website and GSK was named as the only principal sponsor.The museum confirmed to the  it plans to keep the money and spend it on other projects, and said a donor board at the museum names the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation among its funders.The Science Museum said it came to an agreement with the foundation that the £2m gift “would be most effectively applied to support work across the museum’s world-class scientific, technological and medical collections rather than being specifically designated to one project”.The museum has previously been criticised for taking money from BP and Shell. The director of the Science Museum group, Ian Blatchford, defended the museum’s decision to take money from oil companies, including for sponsorship of exhibitions about climate-related issues.The campaign group Culture Unstained said that despite Blatchford’s “regular outbursts in defence of his unethical donors and sponsors”, on this occasion the museum had “accepted that the Sackler name is just too toxic”.A spokesperson said: “Rather than trying to quietly hide away dirty money, the museum should be drawing an ethical red line and turning it down. When other cultural organisations are confidently cutting their ties to oil money too, it’s troubling that when it comes to ethical sponsorship the Science Museum is still dragging its feet.”The US pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, which is owned by some branches of the Sackler family, makes the highly addictive opioid prescription painkiller OxyContin, and is facing several lawsuits over its alleged role in the US opioid crisis. The branch of the family descended from Arthur Sackler is not linked to OxyContin. The Sacklers, who deny all the allegations, have been significant funders of British culture for many years, and the Science Museum is the latest high-profile institution to have its connections to the family questioned.In March, the National Portrait Gallery announced it was dropping a £1m grant from the family after pressure from campaign groups which said accepting money would make them complicit in the harm its products have allegedly caused. “They did the right thing,” said Nan Goldin, a US artist who has been one of the Sacklers’ most vocal critics and has previous discussed her own addiction to opioids. “I hope there is a domino effect now there needs to be.”Earlier this year, Tate announced it would no longer accept donations from the family because of its alleged links to the opioid crisis. Shortly afterwards the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where a Sackler sat on the board for many years, said it would no longer accept gifts from the family. In July, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tristram Hunt, defended its decision to not remove the Sackler name from its galleries.Last year, the South London Gallery returned a £125,000 award from the Sacklers, with its director, Margot Heller, telling the Art Newspaper that “the gallery’s board took a majority decision that it was in the best interests of the charity to return the grant”.Representatives from the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b86dae0770f9338db86795b3748ff0e1d2ca64/0_223_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42423faf7af18cde27f79d6c814d91c6","title":"schools monitor students online activity","story":"As families worry for their children’s futures, a district has instituted a yearly data purgeParents at a public school district in Maryland have won a major victory for student privacy: tech companies that work with the school district now have to purge the data they have collected on students once a year. Experts say the district’s “Data Deletion Week” may be the first of its kind in the country.It’s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It’s a place where many federal employees, lawyers and security experts send their own kids.As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation’s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need.Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops and has hired tech companies to track students’ activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit.This digital surveillance – a booming industry – is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on inidual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids.This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard rescinded the admissions of at least 10 incoming students for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard rescinded an offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of racist comments he had made in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate.Parents across the US told the  that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children – like how quickly they complete their homework – being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on iniduals’ online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Iniduals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches.By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery county said they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed “the student data surveillance industrial complex”.Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and publicly launched the program this past August.While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students’ digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by Go, which tracks students’ web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer.The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: “They send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,” Cevenini said.Go has already submitted its formal certification the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said.One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son’s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop.Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that Go, which the school pays to monitor students’ search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son.The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or “de-identify” his child’s data, was not enough for Shear. As a policy expert who had worked to pass social media privacy laws in states across the country, Shear said, he knew that “de-identified” data could usually be re-identified again.He decided to push for district-wide changes in how Go and other companies retain children’s data, including working to educate and organize other parents to push the school district to change its policies and require tech companies to regularly delete student data.“You don’t need to keep for ever what these kids are searching for online, or what’s in their Gchats,” Shear said.“Even when data is supposed to only be used for one purpose, it will be used for other purposes,” he added. “We don’t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college.”Shear met with district officials to discuss his concerns, and he soon found allies on the district’s active parent-teacher association, which has an entire committee dedicated to “safe technology” issues.One parent on the safe tech committee, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son’s privacy, had an experience similar to Shear’s.She said her then eight-year-old son typed in “save the land” when doing a book report on conservation, “and up came the Ku Klux Klan … ‘Save the land, join the Klan.’ He didn’t know what that was,” she said.When she talked to the teacher and suggested wiping the search from her son’s browser history, the teacher said that would not be possible, the parent recalled. If anyone was building a digital footprint of her son’s behavior, the parent said, there would now be a visit to a Klan site in it.“Kids are curious. They’re just going to plug in some key words thinking that they’re funny, and it just might stick,” she said.“I want my child to do whatever he wants to do with his career and his life,” said Ellen Zavian, a George Washington University law professor and another of the parent advocates. “If he wants to run for office, something he did in second grade shouldn’t hold him back. If he wants to apply for college, he should have no data that the colleges have bought that would provide a negative data point.Even with broad parental support, demanding that companies delete student data was not a simple process, Shear said. Parents had to work with the school district to understand what the district had agreed to in its contracts with different technology companies, and to figure out if the contract language needed to be changed. The parents also wanted tech companies not simply to say they had deleted student data, but to certify that they had done so in an official letter to the district.“It was a complicated process,” Shear said. “It was not something that was so simple.”While parent fears over student data and privacy are “newer concerns” for school districts, the pushback that the district heard from a few parent activists also amounted to “kind of universal concerns”, and school officials decided to “get ahead of the game and see how we can address them”, Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer, said.Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that, as far as she is aware, Montgomery county is the only American school district to have implemented an annual Data Deletion Week, although parent activists across the country have pushed for other student privacy laws at the state level.Deleting records of students’ online behavior on a regular basis is a “fabulous” choice, Vance said, but doing it just once a year might not be frequent enough. Video surveillance footage is often deleted once a month, just long enough to be clear if there’s an incident that needs to be reviewed, she said, and a similar 30-day time period might also be appropriate for students’ online behavior.While there are good reasons for schools to monitor students’ internet usage – like making sure that “students aren’t being radicalized on YouTube” or “viewing totally inappropriate content”, Vance said, that monitoring can also be “incredibly invasive”.“It’s essentially a reflection of every aspect of kids’ lives today,” she said. “It is every question they ask in their brain and type into Google to see if there’s an answer. It’s every chat message that they type to their friends, every essay they write for English class.”But school districts also may face some barriers in developing Data Deletion Week policies, she said, including different state data retention laws, and parents’ and students’ desire to be able to save some of their school projects from frequent data purges.Shear, the attorney who led the push for Data Deletion Week, said he sees the rapid growth of the school surveillance industry as a “huge issue” and one that needed much more attention from students and their families.“Most parents don’t understand these issues until something happens,” he said. “You don’t really care about something until you’re discriminated against, or until you lose out to another person based on something you might never even have thought of.”The Montgomery county parent activists acknowledged that their push to change their district’s policies benefited from the expertise of the Washington-area parents involved, which included not only attorneys but people with expertise in security, privacy and politics.Having that kind of expertise behind a parent privacy campaign “is unusual”, Zavian said. “But it doesn’t mean that other communities can’t pull on those resources. They have them. They just have to find them.

But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03bcff1adf531ea1ba9d35dd2295f635b8df602b/709_0_2936_1763/master/2936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8286f501f15d11c22d38eeb83a270b7","title":"how hollywood feted the black power movement and fell foul of the fbi","story":"The biopic Seberg tells the tragic story of film star Jean Seberg who – along with Marlon Brando and Jane Fonda – gave money and public support for the Black PanthersHuey P Newton was rowing towards the Cuban coastline in a dinghy with only one oar when it capsized. The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA BBS Productions). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider. Now they were attempting to do to American life what they had done to Hollywood: brazenly tear up the rulebook and redistribute power.The producers had clandestinely shuttled Newton to Mexico, then convinced a Colombian smuggler – known only as “the Pirate” – to take the black radical, who was on the run after being accused of shooting a 17-year-old sex worker, into Cuban waters. But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn’t the hero’s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS’s most audacious production.It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers. In the late 60s and early 70s, dozens of actors, producers and directors would flirt with the revolutionary group – funding them, championing them and chronicling their rise and fall.The story of Newton and Schneider’s shambolic but ultimately successful bromance is on its way to becoming a TV series in the US with the original magazine story written by Joshuah Bearman – the same journalist who recounted the real-life storytale that became the Oscar winner Argo – being adapted into a limited series. Meanwhile, Seberg – the Jean Seberg biopic starring Kristen Stewart as the American starlet – is released in the UK next month. It tells the story of the star who was plucked out of obscurity in Marshalltown, Iowa after a talent search and became a darling of the French New Wave – starring in Otto Preminger’s Saint Joan in 1957 and then Jean Luc-Godard’s Breathless in 1960. Seberg’s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI.In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship – the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic – with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles.After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal’s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who – before she became infamous after raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970 – donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg’s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her “a social nuisance” in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn’s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O’Connell. They are told they must carry on hounding the actor because the orders come “straight from the top” – meaning Hoover, who would sign off on the release of information to a gossip column in Hollywood that indicated that Seberg was pregnant with Jamal’s child. It was a lie – she had in fact got pregnant after a fling with a young Mexican actor – but it spread before she’d had a chance to explain the situation to her French husband, Romain Gary, driving a wedge between them. Seberg had a miscarriage in 1970 – the stress and paranoia that she endured having possibly contributed to it – and a mental breakdown. In a 1974 interview with the New York Times, Seberg discussed leaving the world of the black radicals behind – not because of the FBI intimidation, but because she felt her breakdown had made her a burden. “I’ve analysed the fact that I’m not equipped to participate absolutely and totally,” she said. “I had a very, very bad mental breakdown, and now I realise I wouldn’t want a person like me in a group I was a member of, as Groucho Marx would put it.”She also discussed returning home with her dead baby to prove the child’s ethnicity. “We opened the coffin and took 180 photographs, and everybody in Marshalltown who was curious what colour the baby was got a chance to check it out,” she said. “A lot of them came to look.” Seberg remained in Paris where her mental health problems continued. At 40 she was found dead in her car, after an apparent suicide. The Seberg case showed the lengths the FBI would go to in order to sabotage those associated with the Panthers, but it also highlighted the pull of the group. New Hollywood stars didn’t have to go as far as Seberg they could conveniently and safely tap into the group’s energy at fundraisers in Beverly Hills mansions and New York townhouses. Seberg was inspired to start acting after she saw Marlon Brando in The Men in 1950, and 18 years later the pair would be two of the Black Panthers’ most vocal Hollywood supporters. Brando was a boost for the Panthers because he raised their profile, but he was also a way to financially prop up an organisation that was constantly having to find bail money and needed cash to support a rapidly expanding operation.A donor to the Panthers’ cause, Brando gave the eulogy at the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a teenage Panther who was killed in April 1968 by the Oakland police while trying to surrender. “I’m not going to stand up and make a speech because you’ve been listening to white people for 400 years,” he said, before duly going on to give a speech in which he decried living standards for black Americans. After a fundraiser thrown by Shirley Douglas, then married to Donald Sutherland, senior Panther Bobby Seale reportedly said: “We took Marlon Brando for $10,000, we can take Jean Seberg for $20,000.” They would get a lot more from the New Hollywood cohort.The list of celebrity donors to the group reads like a who’s who of New (and old) Hollywood. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton signed cheques. Fonda solicited for donations to the Panthers at Taylor’s Oscars party in 1970. Mia Farrow, Shirley MacLaine and Barbra Streisand all contributed. But the relationship was not a one-way street: the group found inspiration from the new breed of risk-taking film-makers. As Newton became more unpredictable and isolated as the Panthers’ leader, he turned to The Godfather and would extol “its protagonists’ machiavellian cunning and ruthlessness”. Newton also loved Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song – Melvin Van Peebles’s groundbreaking 1971 film about a hustler who becomes a revolutionary and runs away to Mexico – which had more than a slight resemblance to his own story. Such fandom translated into real-life attempts at film-making. Richard Pryor was a close friend of Newton and was working on a screenplay about the Black Panther leaders’ life at Schneider’s LA home when an accident while freebasing cocaine left him with burns to his face and body he abruptly kiboshed the project. Seale and Newton were also reportedly working on a blaxploitation screenplay when their relationship broke down and Seale fled Oakland after Newton allegedly had him pistol-whipped.New Hollywood documentaries detailed the Panthers’ rise and contributed to their mystique. Howard Alk’s American Revolution 2 follows the Panthers after the unrest at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as its leadership attempts to form an alliance with poor, disenfranchised whites. Alk’s The Murder of Fred Hampton serves as an “exposé of state-sponsored anti-black terror”, with the documentary maker attempting to reveal the extent of the FBI’s involvement in the young, charismatic leader’s death. David Weiss’s No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger makes the link between the black liberation and anti-war movements, while documenting the anti-Vietnam-war march on the United Nations in 1967.Perhaps the most potent Panthers documentary is Agnès Varda’s 27-minute portrait, which captures the energy of the nascent movement in Oakland during the summer of 1968. Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver articulately unpack the Panthers’ Marxist ideology, while other female Panthers explain the importance of wearing their hair naturally. Fifty years later, it still feels radical and Karina Longworth, host of You Must Remember This – who dedicated an exhaustive and excellent eight-episode run of her podcast to the story of Jane Fonda, Seberg and their relationship to black radical groups – believes Varda’s film represents the kind of romantic view of the group that Seberg and the New Hollywood supporters may have shared.Other films tapped into the comic potential of the Panthers, none more so than Robert Downey Snr’s innovative Putney Swope. Made in 1969, the same year Easy Rider ushered in the new wave of US film-making, it’s the story of a token black executive at a Madison Avenue ad agency – played by Arnold Johnson with his voice dubbed by the director – who accidentally becomes chairman and then replaces all the white employees with black revolutionaries. Advocates of the film include Paul Thomas Anderson, Louis CK and Boots Riley, who took the voice-dubbing concept to an even more surreal level in his 2017 satire Sorry to Bother You. So what became of Newton after his daring sea crossing? He was eventually released by the Cuban authorities and briefly settled down into a life of sugar-cane farming and motor repairs. At the same time, BBS Productions ran out of steam in a Hollywood that had shifted from late-60s optimism and invention into the late-70s blockbuster era. Newton’s caper was effectively BBS’s last act. But Schneider would have another revolutionary moment, when he appeared on stage at the 1975 Academy Awards to accept his award for best documentary for his anti-Vietnam-war doc Hearts and Minds. He offered “greetings of friendship to all the American people” from the North Vietnamese government, while dressed in a white tuxedo. Meanwhile, Jane Fonda continued to promote revolutionary politics, and the 1979 Academy Awards would become known as the “Vietnam Oscars” because of the political tensions over two New Hollywood anti-war movies, Coming Home and The Deer Hunter.  It is easy to mock the radical affiliations of Brando, Schneider and Fonda as contrived bandwagon jumping. But in the 70s they risked their careers and, in the case of Seberg, destroyed them in order to support a cause. In our age of ephemeral hashtag activism, when stars can send a tweet about an issue and be celebrated for it, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate their radical chic. • Seberg is released on 10 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a724566a8330cab5c7c580ac03914d8db309a/0_142_2506_1504/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82697b90fe27324ed8f31ab390cad0e5","title":"maggie smith harry potter downton abbey were not satisfying","story":"The actor has said that, while grateful for the work, ‘I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things’Dame Maggie Smith has said her work in the Harry Potter films and on Downton Abbey “wasn’t what you’d call satisfying”.The actor, 84, played schoolmistress Minerva McGonagall in the boy-wizard films and the waspish Violet Crawley in the period drama. Discussing the earlier years of her career, she told ES magazine: “It seemed to take ages to get away from light comedy.”She added: “I am deeply grateful for the work in Potter and indeed Downton, but it wasn’t what you’d call satisfying. I didn’t really feel I was acting in those things.”Smith returned to the stage this year as Joseph Goebbels’ secretary in the Christopher Hampton one-woman play A German Life. She said that as soon as she agreed to do it, she suffered “doubt, doubt, doubt”.“I suddenly felt twice as old as I actually was,” she said. “And also, when you haven’t done a show for a long time, there’s something pretty dumb about doing it totally on your own.”The long-awaited Downton Abbey movie made almost $200m on release earlier this year, with home entertainment numbers expected to be healthy. Smith was reported to be on of the last cast members to agree to the feature film her involvement would also be key to any sequel.Speaking about the possibility of a followup last week, one of the film’s producers, Graham Neame, confirmed there is a potential film in the works.“We’re working on what the story is,” he said, “and when we might be able to make it.“But it’s the same as the first time around: we have to try and get everyone back together again.

He finds himself in the bar where he first met his wife, when the world was at his feet, and where customers and staff are all still puffing away on Gauloises. It’s like a peculiarly French mashup of Westworld and The Truman Show.Unlike Truman, though, Victor is aware that his surroundings have been artificially created, and they help him come to terms with his present. Travelling into the past is a conscious decision on his part, one that has been specifically ordered and paid for, albeit from “Les Voyageurs du Temps”, an outfit that sounds like something from a story by Philip K Dick – Rekal Incorporated, perhaps, from We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (the inspiration for Total Recall and its 2012 remake) – or from one of Charlie Kaufman’s screenplays, such as Lacuna Inc. from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Indeed, the plot of La Belle Epoque is so improbable it could almost be sci-fi, but the film has muscled its way to mainstream attention by refashioning its premise as a romantic comedy of manners.In the forthcoming fantasy-adventure comedy sequel Jumanji: The Next Level, three high-school students go back into the role-playing game to rescue a friend. This time, unlike in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017), they make a conscious decision to immerse themselves in an artificial world, where you can be sure a fresh set of life lessons will be learned. And in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, due in UK cinemas next month, TV personality Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) dispenses benign aperçus and life lessons from the studio where he presides over a pastel-coloured toy village complete with model railway, “Owl Correspondence School” and puppet population. No one is under the illusion that the village is real, yet it’s not an escapist theme park so much as a safe place of emotional honesty and positive thinking.These characters use their simulated realities in a therapeutic way, just as Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell) in Welcome to Marwen (2018) deals with the brain damage he sustained in an attack by white supremacists by building a village in his backyard. Not just any village but a Belgian one in the second world war. No longer able to paint or draw because of his injuries, Hogancamp works through his unresolved trauma by setting up and photographing melodramatic scenarios in which the village’s Action Man and Barbie doll inhabitants, as avatars of himself and the people he knows, repeatedly fight back against the Nazi invaders.Such scenarios stand out amid one of the most pervasive cinema trends of the past 30 years, in that they’ve added a layer of awareness to the “rubber reality” syndrome. From The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) onwards, the cinema has always dabbled in alternative realities and imaginary worlds, but towards the end of the 20th century this tendency went into overdrive. In film after film, characters discover that their world is not what it seems. That it is, in fact, a fictional construct sparked by psychological or pathological conditions (Jacob’s Ladder Fight Club A Beautiful Life), or created by aliens (Dark City), an artificial intelligence (The Matrix), psychiatrists (Shutter Island), the supernatural (The Sixth Sense The Others), self-delusion (Mulholland Drive) or friends and relatives (Good Bye, Lenin! 50 First Dates).Rubber reality also crept into crime movies such as The Usual Suspects, Wild Things and at least two thrillers with the tip-off title Deception (2000 and 2008). Such films are fanciful, more personalised updates of the political paranoia thrillers of the 1970s. In preposterous thrillers such as Malice (1993), 88 Minutes (2007), Trance (2013) and Side Effects (2013), the criminal masterplan is so elaborate and requires such insane levels of plotting that you almost feel sorry for the villains, who really ought to have channelled all that preparation and ingenuity into a more lucrative, less risky undertaking, such as politics.Classic film noir, in which the antihero is entangled in a web of deception, often spun by femmes fatales in cahoots with the bad guys, was a shadowy precursor to the reality-is-not-as-it-seems scenario. And just as that genre in its 1940s heyday reflected the anxiety and alienation of a society still traumatised by the second world war and undermined by shifts in moral certitude, so the rise of rubber reality cinema coincided with the evolution of the conspiracy theory from a minority pursuit into a mainstream interest fed by the internet, The X-Files, 911, falsified WMD reports, the Panama Papers and Wikileaks.With so many films pedalling the scenario that the narrative is not to be trusted, audiences have become almost addicted to the “twist”, expecting or demanding one even where it doesn’t exist. Thus they’ve also been primed for a situation in which reality can no longer be trusted, facts are indistinguishable from fiction, everyone has a hidden agenda, the moon landing was faked, vaccination causes autism, the Earth is flat, and Britain can return to a great and glorious past in which the rest of the world falls over itself to shower it with amazing trade deals.With or without a narrative twist, films already offer alternate realities in which audiences can seek refuge, whether it’s an idealised vision of class-ridden Britain in the Downton Abbey movie, the extended Lucasverse of the Star Wars franchise and its TV spin-offs, or the Marvel films, where might is always right and the good guys come out on top. In this context, it’s heartening to see a few pioneers such as La Belle Époque and A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, which suggest to audiences that they themselves can control the narrative, rather than be controlled by it, and that - rather than requiring an army of servants, a full set of Infinity Stones or the Force, all it will take is emotional honesty and clear-eyed thinking.• Jumanji: The Next Level is released in UK cinemas on 13 December.

On 1 May 1997, a journalist named Gavin Hills held an election party that became the stuff of fable.There was a firework for every Tory, let off when they lost their seat, and the sky was ablaze. I wasn’t there, as I didn’t know him, but people talked about it so fervently afterwards that it has entered my memory as the best election night I ever had – the one I wasn’t at. Hills died in a freak drowning accident the same month, tragically young at 31, and the magic of the election party died with him. Now, instead, we have snacks.In the 00s elections, it tended to be pretty clear who was going to win, because Labour was going to win. I remember doing a Question Time-style panel for some sixth formers in 2010, and some bright spark asked Gus O’Donnell whether the civil service was ready for a hung parliament. “Never mind a coalition, we’re not ready for a change of government,” he said.Even though elections are inherently exciting because you get to stay up late, there was very little to get excited about, few marginals and even fewer surprises.You can have a lot of fun with colour coding when the stakes aren’t very high. I used to make cheesecakes decorated as a bar chart of the vote share, which was a shame as people actually prefer blueberries to strawberries, and kiwi to lemon. You can do the same with tiny quiches (cheese, chorizo, spinach), so long as you pretend to think aubergines are blue, when they are actually purple, and you ignore Ukip for disambiguation, which we all did, anyway, probably for too long.That was quite a lot of work in 2001 2005 was entirely crisps. Cheese and onion for the Tories, salt and vinegar for the Greens, roast chicken for the Lib Dems and spicy tomato Wheat Crunchies for Labour, which are – when in the right mood – the most delicious crisp imaginable.In 2010, the accepted wisdom was that Labour would probably scrape through again. There was just a residual sense that the country would give Gordon Brown one term of his own, because of fairness, and how long he had been waiting. Subconsciously, I must have known that wasn’t true, because my hosting strategy was to get everyone completely hammered. It had taken a decade, but having finally acknowledged that there were no blue foods apart from fruit, and that nobody wants fruit at a party, I went nuts with blue curaçao (plus vodka and lemonade to make a blue lagoon), very red negronis, greyhounds (which are yellowish) and caipirinhas. When the results started to roll in, nobody could understand them – it was like watching dogs try to do crosswords.There is a salient point to make here about how often accepted wisdom is wrong not because polling is flawed or the country has changed in invisible ways, but because of the baseline assumption that things will probably be a bit like they were last time.So, in 2015, everyone was expecting another hung parliament, and the mood turned to ash at exactly 10pm with the exit polls. I can’t remember whether or not people immediately went home, but they definitely didn’t eat the colour-coded macarons, which was good, as they are mad expensive and I hadn’t bought enough.I didn’t have a party for the EU referendum, because it was a stain on democracy. Nor in 2017, because, again, even though I didn’t believe the prevailing certainty of a Tory landslide, I didn’t think I had the stomach to toast it if it happened.This year is different, because I’ve had an epiphany it would have been helpful to have in 2010: whatever the result, the day after will demand more energy and fellowship, not less.So this year, I’m focusing on people rather than parties – which, in any case, are more fun to represent. I’ll take a bunch of marginals and make a finger food out of regionally appropriate snacks. A lot of them will be by the sea (North East Fife, Hastings and Rye, Workington), so fish finger sandwiches. All anyone eats in Richmond and Cheltenham is vol-au-vents.

Do you use butter or mayo? Is white bread essential? Do Wotsits work?The crisp sandwich is food’s equivalent of picking your nose. We all do it. Yes, even you. And, particularly in private, it can be a source of profound pleasure. But only rarely do you find a few brave souls – chapeau!, Jack Monroe, Nadiya Hussain and Emma Freud – willing to talk about it in public.This is a processed-food item so persuasive that even a chef as organically handcrafted as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall cannot resist it (“It’s very hard to beat a good crisp sandwich.”), yet – bar that curious outbreak of crisp butty cafes in 2015 – we collectively neglect serious analysis of what makes it such a comfort-food classic. We are ashamed. Inhibited by snobbery. Waiting for a Spanish chef to deconstruct it or a hip Williamsburg diner to reassure us it is cool.But who has time for that? At How to Eat – the series exploring how best to consume Britain’s favourite foods – there is no guilt, only pleasure. Therefore, let us settle once and for all on the crisp sandwich’s ultimate form.Naturally, HTE is fully in favour of real bread – in the right circumstances. This is not one of them. Put the sourdough back. Step away from the worthy loaves. The crisp sandwich is meant to be an uninhibited pig-out, which will be ruined by using earnest wholemeal or ostensibly healthy seeded breads. Not only will their flavour jar horribly with the crisps, but the pious presence of those self-righteous seeds and grains will cast an anxious pall over proceedings, as if the bread is judging your filling and finding it wantonly gluttonous.Instead, you need a mass-produced white sliced loaf that, in its milky blandness, will offer more cushioning texture than flavour. It should be a neutral delivery vehicle for your chosen crisp.Not all supermarket loaves are created equal, however. Many are as light and airy as packing foam, with none of its durability. These fragile breads fall apart at the first flash of a butter knife. Ideally, you want to forcibly squash the top layer of your sandwich down as you make it, to mould it around the crisps, so it neatly retains them as you eat. For that, you need relatively dense squishy bread, such as Jackson’s white bloomer or – if you can stomach the company’s £25,000 donation to the Conservative party in 2010 – perhaps the world’s best crisp-sandwich bread, Warburtons toastie loaf.If using a less politically compromised cob, bap or roll, avoid those with firm crusts that require you to tear at them. You will scatter crisp shrapnel everywhere. In that regard, a baguette is the least-practical crisp sandwich bread. Do not think about toasting your bread. This is already a dry sandwich.Like many of the best things in life, a crisp sandwich needs lubrication. Ultimately, you will slather your slice with what you can afford. Margarine does a job, particularly on a crisp sandwich. It oils the wheels of mastication without positively boosting flavour. But if you do have a pound or three spare, HTE is unbending in its view that butter is one of the best investments in the supermarket chiller cabinet. Yes, its rich creaminess is a marginal gain in this context. But what is the pursuit of perfection if not the painstaking accumulation of such gains?The idea that on a crisp butty of all things, you would deny yourself butter on health grounds and instead subject yourself to one of the light ’n’ spreadable, sterol-and-stanol, I-never-believed-it-wasn’t-butter-vegetable-oil options is baffling. You. Are. Eating. A. Crisp. Sandwich. The boat has sailed on blood pressure. Its salt levels will be unacceptable to all medical professionals. Your arterial health is an accident waiting to happen. We are dying. Every day. Embrace that reality or this endeavour will have been a comparative waste of time. And calories. For a diminished flavour payoff.The crisp sandwich is an all-in, sod-the-consequences commitment. For instance, there are multiple things wrong with this Sainsbury’s recipe (onion, tomato, gherkins, salad leaves!), but perhaps the worst is its use of unsalted butter. On a crisp sandwich. In health terms, this is the dictionary definition of a false economy.HTE refuses to get into an argument about whether extruded corn snacks are crisps or not. It will not indulge Pringles pedants, who refuse to acknowledge a product consisting of rice flour and wheat starch mixed into a dehydrated potato base. Instead, HTE takes the following highly unscientific position: is it in the crisp aisle in the supermarket? Then it is a crisp. Yes, even the nuts and Mini Cheddars.That settled, surely we can all agree that “fluffy” crisps – Monster Munch, Skips, spicy Nik Naks, Quavers, Chipsticks, generic cheesy balls – have no role to play in a crisp sandwich? The flavour intensity of Wotsits makes them tempting, and Frazzles taste more like bacon than bacon. But you need a crisp that offers a definitive crunch and clear textural contrast here. Not corn snacks that, when sandwiched between two slices of bread, produce what feels like a mouthful of cotton wool.Fluffy crisps share that dehydration issue with, at the other extreme, Doritos, Scampi Fries and Mini Cheddars. Yes, they all pack plenty of crunch, but they lack the palpable easy-eating greasiness of mainstream crisps. A Mini Cheddar sandwich turns to claggy putty in the mouth. You would need several pints of water to get it down.For different reasons, HTE is also ruling out posher “hand-cooked” crisps in the Kettle sphere and upwards. Generally, they are too thick and rigid in a sandwich (yes, there is such a thing as too crunchy) and, in the case of Tyrells, their pure flavours create a psychological dissonance. In a crisp sandwich, you do not want crisps that actually taste of the advertised ingredients. If you wanted a cheesy flavour, you would make a cheese sandwich. Rather, you want that lab-refined synthetic cheese-style cheese-and-onion flavour profile that, while it owes little to nature, wows on its own terms.That is the curious paradox at the heart of the crisp sandwich: it works best when you add crisps that mimic sandwich ingredient flavours, so roast chicken, salt and vinegar (chip butty), smoky bacon or cheese and onion, rather than sweet chilli or prawn cocktail. But you also want those flavours delivered at the heightened, entirely artificial, level of intensity that only the cleverest boffins of the food-industrial complex can achieve using ingenious combinations of yeast extract, citric acid, garlic powder, dried cheese “cheese flavour” and umami disodium 5’-ribonucleotide.The crisp-sandwich-filling sweet spot, then, is to be found in a mainline bag of Walkers (other brands are available) or, another marginal but important gain, in slightly thicker ridge-cut crisps such as Seabrook ascending to the – fans self! – positively hunky McCoy’s. Firm and muscular, yet given to melting greasily in the mouth, the all-powerful salt and vinegar McCoy’s is, perhaps, the ultimate crisp sandwich filling.Note: never use ready-salted crisps. Too parsimonious. There isn’t a war on. Yet.If you are going the full home-cooked-potato-sandwich hog, different rules apply. But it is incredibly difficult to sparingly apply Tommy K or hot sauce without drowning the crisp’s flavour. You are now eating a ketchup or hot sauce sandwich with crunchy bits. That is wrong.If the butter has been applied liberally enough (if not, why not?), there should be no need for mayonnaise, much less salad cream. Regular readers will know that HTE is unapologetically proud of its working-class origins. But a certain reverse snobbery attaches itself to salad cream. Salad cream is the point at which clinging to your roots reveals a debilitating lack of ambition and curiosity, and a refusal to conceive of a wider world of possibilities.Is it shame, embarrassment or a desperate need to create new content that inspires advice on how to “pimp” a crisp butty or “take your crisp sandwich game to the next level”? HTE cannot say.What it does know is that most of the commonly added extras – cold, clammy ham thick, gluey peanut butter overpoweringly vinegary pickles – actively detract from the sandwich. As do attempts to give it a gourmet spin. The crisp sandwich does not need brie, bacon jam or rocket. Or caviar. It does not need to justify itself on foodie terms. Go down that route – as per Burts steak and stilton recipe with sea salt and peppercorn crisps – and the crisps soon become a mere seasoning on an entirely different sandwich. That is, as the late Amy Winehouse used to like sliced on top, bananas.A little extra-mature cheddar brings greater depth to a cheese-and-onion crisp sandwich, but even that it is far from essential.A plate. Or the Hoover. You will need one. Possibly both.Curiously (it’s the bread), while HTE would never eat a bag of crisps with a brew – that requires beer or cola – the crisp sandwich cries out for a steaming mug of something brick red and deeply tannic that you could plot on axes labelled Yorkshire Tea and M\u0026ampS Extra Strong.So, the crisp sandwich: how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af70c234e3b73110a201487c9262cff625563141/0_547_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fbe0eb5afebceda90d7e8c7c0cdd1d1","title":"jay rayner clove cinnamon chocolate boxes christmas stinks","story":"There is no other time of the year that is so completely enveloped in aromas. No wonder our memories are in overdriveIt was the smell of Elnett that did it to me. One moment I was a fiftysomething male. The next, I was a four-year-old boy again. It was just before the start of a live show and I was in the backstage dressing room, staring at myself in the mirror. I concluded my never less than ludicrous hair looked tonight like it had been styled courtesy of me stuffing my wet fingers into a plug socket. Something had to be done. Which was when I spotted the can of Elnett, left behind by a previous performer. I damped down my so-called hairstyle, and went to work setting it in place.The intensity of the smell of the hair lacquer took me by surprise. It was bitter and acrid in a way which catches at the back of the throat, but also heavily perfumed as though trying to hide its true industrial nature. It was the smell of my mother, just before she went out for the night it was the smell of the adult world, of glamour and also of something else. Abandonment would be too strong a word for it, but certainly disappointment would do the job. I was once again the small child standing in my parent’s room watching and smelling the finishing touches being put in place, before she left me to the casual indifference of the babysitter.It’s fitting that it should have happened at this time of year because, frankly, Christmas stinks. There is no other time of the year so completely enveloped by smells. It is wistfulness in three dimensions which, as winter darkness closes in, transports us. We gasp and sigh at the twinkly lights. We find a place in our souls for kitsch. But it’s the seasonal smells which really hammer away. Certainly, they hammer away at me. Awakened by the olfactory punch of Elnett I have become like Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, the foundling antihero of Patrick Suskind’s magnificent novel Perfume, who navigates his way through 18th-century French society courtesy of a talent for identifying aromas.These are the weeks of clove and cinnamon, of ginger and booze-soaked fruit. It’s not all universally pleasant. That the right mix of spices can take me to the cheery thought of a boiling pot of wine, mulled because throwing dried bits of tree bark into substandard wine we wouldn’t dare touch at any other time of year, makes a twisted kind of sense. But if the scent of cinnamon is too artificial, too much like something engineered to mask the smell of a public toilet, suddenly I am wafted to the lobby of a high-end hotel in Dubai. It is the weeks just before Christmas a decade ago, and I am assailed by the memory of feeling so very out of place and so terribly far from home.There is science to explain all this. Apparently, the same part of our brain which recognises smells also stores our emotional responses. It’s designed this way to tell us whether what we are smelling is something we need be scared of or not.It’s useful to know how it works, but that doesn’t describe the personal impact of smelling, say, the virtuous interplay of smoked, cured pig and its clove-studded treacle glaze, in the moments before the ham leaves the oven. It doesn’t describe the hit of dried sage used in a stuffing, or the sickly-sweetness inside a tin of Quality Street when you prise the lid off. Indeed, I’ve come to the conclusion that Christmas really isn’t about family, or presents, or food. It’s all about the smells. Now do excuse me. I’ve got to go and snort some more hairspray."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1c5221ef7834d887dfe138d6eace92c1234d07/0_181_1741_1045/master/1741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcaecbf0d34db6f0ca159aebf80cc760","title":"arsenal brighton premier league match report","story":"Rome was not built in a day and Freddie Ljungberg is discovering Arsenal’s decline has hardly been a short-term issue either. It will take a prodigious effort, whether from the new interim head coach or anyone else, to whip this group of players into shape and that impression was confirmed in the starkest terms.Brighton dominated most of Ljungberg’s first home game in charge, fully deserving the win given to them by Adam Webster and, 10 minutes from the end, Neal Maupay. Arsenal were unable to build on Alexandre Lacazette’s equaliser and many more non-performances like this will strengthen the case for the managerial situation to be resolved as soon as possible.Ljungberg had taken to the dugout in a thick bench jacket that kept the critics who, irrelevantly, had questioned his choice of attire at Carrow Road on Sunday guessing. Whether or not he had discarded the grey sweater this time, he certainly needed his team to be smarter.To that end he made three changes from the side that had hung on at Norwich: Lucas Torreira had finished that game well so replaced Matteo Guendouzi, while the selections of Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Héctor Bellerín for Shkodran Mustafi and Calum Chambers were unsurprising.The low-key nature of the opening stages was more noteworthy. Ljungberg was made to feel perfectly welcome but there was not quite a hero’s reception nor was there anything approaching a full house, although there was more life inside the Emirates than for Unai Emery’s last rites against Eintracht Frankfurt seven days earlier.Arsenal had started briskly against Norwich but a compact and composed Brighton side drew any early sting. Graham Potter’s players shaded possession in the opening quarter and anyone wondering what Ljungberg had been able to change in two straight days of training had to forage for scraps. Lacazette flicked a header across goal and David Luiz saw a daisycutter clutched by Mathew Ryan there was plainly some appetite to move the ball swiftly, but little structure to make that a success.Emboldened, Brighton began to ask questions. Aaron Connolly would have had a shooting chance had Bellerín, who was booked, not tugged him back a foot outside the area, Pascal Gross eventually wasting the free-kick. Bernd Leno then clutched a Webster header and, moments later, Connolly was millimetres from erting the ball home after Maupay drilled it across.By now the game was almost entirely being contested in Arsenal’s half. Maupay extended Leno from 20 yards and the pressure did not really abate until Webster’s goal. It came after Arsenal failed to defend a corner, Dan Burn winning the first header and Connolly almost getting a shot away. The ball fell to Webster, who gave Brighton a lead they entirely deserved.Arsenal could only improve from this point, and they offered a glimmer when Ryan repelled Joe Willock’s header. But they had been outplayed and, when Connolly and Maupay broke again, only Granit Xhaka’s alertness prevented the latter from making it two.Even allowing for the opposition’s competence, it had been a solid contender for Arsenal’s worst half of the season. Ljungberg reacted by introducing Nicolas Pépé for Willock and presumably by telling his team to shift up several gears too. Arsenal pressed immediately and it told within five minutes when Lacazette, with a near-identical header to his first-half effort, met Mesut Özil’s corner at the near post. Whether or not he was going for goal, it drifted beyond Ryan’s e and dropped into the far corner. At last the Ljungberg era had a chance to gain genuine traction.Crosses began to fizz across the Brighton goal, one from Sead Kolasinac narrowly missing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The tempo was unrecognisable but their propensity to offer chances felt familiar nonetheless. Maupay had one for Brighton just after the hour when a scurrying Leno stopped him converting Aaron Mooy’s header, Lewis Dunk heading the resulting corner over.It felt briefly that Arsenal had shaken some of those old issues when David Luiz volleyed Özil’s free-kick past Ryan. The players had lined to restart by the time a VAR check, which showed the scorer was clearly offside, had been completed and on this occasion nobody could have any complaints.Nor could anyone quibble when Maupay decided the issue, because this Arsenal side is simply incapable of turning the screw. In the previous 10 minutes they had allowed Brighton to reassert a measure of their earlier control and then, for the umpteenth time, they allowed Mooy to check into a good crossing position. Maupay’s run and header were timed to perfection Ryan saved a similar effort from Martinelli four minutes from time and Arsenal showed no sign of escaping the doldrums."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c8345a95bde22c5021c552cc3ab16e89cf0878/0_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8bbe83027bde38537b223be415cc805","title":"everton sack marco silva david moyes premier league relegation zone manager","story":"Duncan Ferguson has been placed in temporary charge of Everton after Farhad Moshiri, the club’s majority shareholder, made Marco Silva his fourth managerial sacking in under four years.Silva was dismissed midway through a three-year contract with Everton languishing in the relegation zone after eight defeats in their past 11 Premier League matches.Moshiri had been reluctant to part company with the Portuguese, an appointment he instigated and ultimately had to pay Watford around £4m in compensation for, but the manner of Wednesday’s shambolic 5-2 defeat at Liverpool proved the breaking point.David Moyes is the leading candidate to succeed Silva with Tim Cahill under consideration to become the former Everton manager’s assistant. Moyes has been championed for some time by the chairman, Bill Kenwright, despite his poor track record since leaving for Manchester United after his Everton contract expired in 2013.The 56-year-old is available having been out of work since leaving West Ham in May 2018, although he will not be installed before Saturday’s home game against Chelsea. His first game could be away at United on Sunday week.Ferguson, a first-team coach under several Everton managers, was asked to take temporary charge following a chaotic day that saw Moshiri visit Silva in person at the club’s training complex. Neither Moshiri nor Kenwright attended the derby defeat at Anfield but Moshiri travelled from London to visit Finch Farm with fellow board members and the director of football, Marcel Brands.Silva took training as usual on Thursday before Brands instructed the first-team squad to remain behind for a meeting with Moshiri. The players were not criticised for their part in Silva’s sacking – it is understood the 42-year-old was not mentioned during the meeting – but were asked what the board could do to help improve their performances. The directors reconvened and, six days after Brands gave an in-house interview calling for stability and unity at Goodison Park, Silva was informed his time as the Everton manager was over after 18 months.He follows Roberto Martínez, Ronald Koeman and Sam Allardyce as managers sacked in Moshiri’s reign – the under-23s’ manager David Unsworth has also taken temporary charge in that time – and leaves with the lowest points-per-game average (1.28) of any Everton manager since Walter Smith, Moyes’s predecessor. Silva won 19 of his 53 league matches at Everton.In a statement the club said: “Majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright and the board of directors would like to thank Marco for his service over the last 18 months and wish him well for the future. Duncan Ferguson has taken temporary charge of the first team and will manage the side for the game against Chelsea on Saturday. The club aims to confirm a new permanent manager as swiftly as possible.”Silva paid an inevitable price for bad results and was left a lame-duck manager after Everton fans turned on him following the 2-0 home defeat by Norwich, who were bottom of the table at kick-off, on 23 November. However, there was also recognition within the Everton hierarchy of his misfortune with injuries and VAR decisions, plus a flawed transfer strategy last summer.Everton spent approximately £117m on players in that time but also recouped £84m from clearing out dead wood inherited from previous managers, plus the reluctant sale of Idrissa Gueye to Paris Saint-Germain. Gueye’s replacement, Jean-Philippe Gbamin, made only two appearances before rupturing a thigh muscle and has yet to resume full training.Another central midfielder, André Gomes, suffered a fracture dislocation to an ankle last month, while Fabian Delph, the summer signing from Manchester City, has been hindered by several injuries.The failure to replace the on-loan Kurt Zouma in central defence also hindered Silva, who had wanted the Chelsea player’s signing to be a priority, while Brands led the £29m signing of 19-year-old striker Moise Kean from Juventus when the manager wanted a more experienced forward. Kean has started only twice in the league and has not scored in 13 appearances in total for the club.Everton’s board, of which Brands is a part, has been ided on sacking Silva, and his potential replacements, for several weeks. The club has spent around £450m on players since Moshiri’s arrival in February 2016, recouping just under half of that, but a string of poor purchases and bad appointments have resulted in another fight for survival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82de0582ac0db61696c60cbb05a7ca494cce23a8/200_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0f6f7a6efc27b2cb39f50c580381e1","title":"sheffield united newcastle premier league match report","story":"It was a homecoming when Steve Bruce was appointed Newcastle manager but, in a different way, this was a happy return to where it all began for him. Twenty-one years after his managerial career commenced at Bramall Lane Bruce inflicted a first defeat since September on his former club Sheffield United to continue Newcastle’s renaissance. They are now 11th which, after Bruce’s traumatic first few weeks, feels like dizzying heights.If this was a case of pilfering the points, with Sheffield United dominating much of the match, goalkeeper Martin Dubravka outstanding and Jonjo Shelvey’s clinching goal controversial, Newcastle nonetheless had much to savour. Defenders have proved their best form of attack this season but, with Allan Saint-Maximin scoring Newcastle’s first goal and Andy Carroll setting up the second, their forwards finally contributed.Two Uniteds have more in common than just the suffix. Each is managed by a lifelong fan and Chris Wilder and Steve Bruce turned to talismanic locals as they altered their attacks. Wilder gave his captain, Billy Sharp, a belated first Premier League start – at 33 he became the oldest English outfield player to make a full debut in the ision since 2007 – while Bruce sprang a surprise by bringing in Carroll. It was 3,264 days and the best part of nine years since his previous start for his hometown club, a few weeks before his £35m move to Liverpool.Yet the initial threat came from their sidekicks. The recalled Oli McBurnie curled a shot over the Newcastle bar and drew a terrific save from the ing Dubravka with a downward header. His chances sandwiched a genuine rarity: a goal from a Newcastle forward. The previous one came courtesy of Joelinton at Tottenham at August. With Newcastle’s £40m record buy demoted to the bench Saint-Maximin belatedly opened his account.The £16.5m winger has become a crowd favourite with his mesmeric, high-speed dribbling. If he can seem a maverick talent, the unexpected element was that he delivered the sort of goal Carroll is renowned for. When Javier Manquillo provided a deep cross Saint-Maximin rose high above the Geordie Chris Basham to direct a towering header past Dean Henderson.It came against the run of play. Sheffield United had been the more progressive side and Dubravka had saved well from Enda Stevens’ deflected shot. The Blades responded positively to trailing a stretching Sharp shot wide after being released by Jack O’Connell and then somehow failing to connect with the defender’s deflected cross. With a game to chase Wilder’s overlapping centre-backs stepped into midfield more, content in the knowledge that Carroll’s lack of pace did not make him a threat on the counter-attack.Sharp had been preferred to the in-form Lys Mousset. He made a mark of sorts when he became the first player cautioned by Stuart Attwell, for a rather needless foul on Manquillo. It felt the first indication of frustration in the home ranks but his strike partner resumed his duel with Dubravka. The goalkeeper came out on top again when he tipped McBurnie’s header over his bar.He produced a still finer stop to keep out Sharp’s ing header and if it was academic – the United captain was offside – it was still an indication of his terrific form. It was Sharp’s final contribution, with Mousset summoned to replace him.Bruce was about to make a similar switch, with Joelinton set to come on, when Carroll won a flick-on and Shelvey surged clear to sidefoot past a motionless Henderson. Sheffield United had stopped, seeing the offside flag raised. Yet VAR showed two defenders were playing Shelvey onside. To the hosts’ consternation the initial decision was reversed and the goal stood.The Sheffield United supporters’ choruses about VAR were unflattering, though technology had rectified the error by the assistant referee Derek Eaton, who had flagged Shelvey offside. The visiting fans, meanwhile, serenaded Bruce as the second goal took some of the tension out of the closing stages, even though Wilder brought on a second and third striker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ccb8d07e9a16b31d2507b8e0997e2dc9b65e089/0_206_3900_2341/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ae83b479db6eb3787ea01410db05e06","title":"chelsea arsenal patrick vieira manager","story":"Frank Lampard has transformed atmosphere at Stamford Bridge and Arsenal’s former captain would do same at EmiratesWhen I left Chelsea to join Juventus last year Antonio Conte was a couple of weeks away from the sack. I had arrived for my second spell at Chelsea in 2012 just a few weeks after Roberto Di Matteo had lost the job. The men’s team won two league titles in the six years I was there but there was also a lot of disappointment and a lot of managers who struggled to really connect with the fans, a problem that continued under Maurizio Sarri last season. On Wednesday, a few days after my return from Turin, I went back to Stamford Bridge working as a pundit to find a club transformed.This is the effect Frank Lampard has had. When he was appointed people questioned his experience, but as an absolute legend at the club he has something other managers can’t match, no matter how many titles they have won. There is a nostalgia and a love between old players and fans that you can’t artificially create and Chelsea is suddenly stuffed with them: Jody Morris is Lampard’s assistant, Eddie Newton is on the coaching staff, Petr Cech’s title is technical and performance adviser. On Wednesday night John Terry was on the Aston Villa bench, another familiar face for the fans to cheer and cherish. Of course football is first and foremost about results and Lampard’s popularity would not last long if his team were disorganised and unsuccessful. He has harnessed this deep emotional connection really well to transform the atmosphere around the club, creating an environment of familiarity and love for the shirt.He has put commitment, discipline and work rate back at the heart of the team. As David Luiz soon found out Lampard is not interested in a player’s reputation, but their attitude. He has made an impact by trusting young players and under him Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori are producing the levels of consistency we associated with Lampard himself as a player. The culture in Chelsea’s academy has changed, from young players knowing they had to go out on loan if they were going to get a game to knowing if they keep pushing they’ve got a chance.On Wednesday against Aston Villa I saw a lot of Lampard in his players, in terms of their discipline and more superficially in the way Mount got his goal from the edge of the penalty area. Sometimes a club legend can impose that on his players. Fans will always feel a connection to a team that guarantees effort, commitment and pride in the badge.Meanwhile at Arsenal another manager has gone and the atmosphere remains one of bitterness and disappointment. Clearly Lampard’s impact at Chelsea has had an effect, because of the bookmakers’ top five favourites for the Arsenal job three used to play for the club – the caretaker, Freddie Ljungberg, Mikel Arteta and Patrick Vieira, and I think the Frenchman is the one to go for.There are more experienced names on the list, with Carlo Ancelotti standing out as someone who can steady the ship, make the team a bit more attacking and attract big-name players. I can see how the idea of bringing in someone who can guarantee an instant impact may appeal to the Arsenal board. Vieira would be more of a long-term commitment, an acceptance they are unlikely to win the league in the next couple of seasons and the best course is to look to the future, trying to build something over three to five years.The atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium is a factor. We all know the Arsenal fans like to make themselves heard, and while most new managers would be welcomed cautiously, or maybe in some cases even with hostility, it is possible to appoint someone who will instantly command their respect, bring a bit of nostalgia and reignite a relationship. In the situation Arsenal find themselves in, after the way the Arsène Wenger era ended and Unai Emery’s appointment panned out they have the great luxury of being able to produce an instant fix for fans – and he is working in Nice.The effect does not always last. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s arrival transformed the atmosphere at Old Trafford and led to a stunning upturn in performances and results that lasted a couple of months. He reminded the players what it means to play for the club. The results have not been sustained – though Wednesday’s victory over Tottenham showed what the squad is capable of – but Solskjær is sticking to his core values: picking players who want to be at United and giving young players a shot.Lampard and Solskjaer have followed a similar path, coaching at academy level, getting some managerial experience at one or more smaller clubs and then moving to a top-six team. Unlike Ljungberg and Arteta, Vieira has gone down the same route. I think that is one reason why I would favour him. There is also something in the way he played – without fear, with fight and responsibility but also with quality and guile – that sounds like the recipe Arsenal require.It is a big call, particularly for a club that has made a lot of bad ones recently about team management and also player recruitment. Some of the decision-making – for example the conclusion that David Luiz and an 18-year-old in William Saliba who could not play for them for at least a year was a good way to invest £35m in the heart of their defence last summer – has just been weird. A bad decision now would not only impact on performances on the pitch and the club’s profit margins off it, it may be terminal for the credibility of everyone involved in making it.In four days over the new year Lampard and Solskjaer will bring their teams to the Emirates by then I think Arsenal should have another legend in the dugout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b81b9c4d849457b216ca3e2eb5d2bf1171f7bfa/307_0_3114_1869/master/3114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8796d15e952bb18767e359ae111809","title":"arsenal v brighton premier league live","story":"Neal Maupay scored late to extend Arsenal’s winless run to nine games – the London club’s worst run since the 1970sLewis Dunk: “We made it tough for ourselves after the first half in which ew were excellent ... but we showed great character to come back and win the game.”Maupay: “Lewis said before the game we can’t say ‘we played well but didn’t get the win’. We needed to win today.” Lee Dixon, referring to how easily Brighton found space all over the pitch, but especially in midfield: “It’s fine to make mistakes, but if you keep making the same mistakes .... There are players out there doing exactly the same thing now that they were doing at the end of last season. The players have got to take responsibility.” Alan Pardew, speaking on Amazon, has it right. “Brighton totally deserved it .... it all came down to basics. If you don’t have pressure on the ball you look disjointed and that was Arsenal. Brighton did all the basics right.”“Only just noticed that Aaron Mooy looks like a young Freddie Ljungberg,” parps Jim Greenan. “This is becoming a Stephen King novel.”Arsenal extend their winless run to nine matches, as Brighton make off with an impressive victory. Graham Potter’s team dominated the first half and went in at the break with a lead thanks to Adam Webster. Freddie Ljungberg inspired an improvement from Arsenal in the second half and they deservedly equalised through Alexander Lacazette. But that was as good as it got for the generally ragged hosts, who fell to an excellent late winning goal by Neal Maupay. Brighton were the better, more accomplished side overall and deserve their win.90+3 min: Trossard pounces on a mistake by Xhaka and dodges his way towards the Arsenal box. He cuts back on to his left foot and then blems a shot over the bar. That would have sealed it!90 min: Pépé curls a low freekick around the wall and wide of the far post. It must have taken a slight nick of the wall, actually, because a corner has been awarded. Nowt comes of it.89 min: Freekick to Arsenal about 20 yards out, a little to the right of the D, after Trossard needlessly fouls Pépé... will he be made to regret that?Brighton substitution: Duffy on, Alzate off. That’s a pretty strong declaration of intent.86 min: Tierney’s provides a wonderful cross from the left. Martinelli meets it with a very good header towards the bottom corner, but Ryan manages sto pushes it behind for a corner. That was almost a convincing cover version of Brighton’s second goal. 84 min: Bellerin scampers down the right and sends a token cross into the box. Easy pickings for Ryan.82 min: Pépé forces Ryan into a moderate save with a reasonable effort from the right. 80 min: That really was an exquisitely crafted goal. Mooy outfoxed Bellerin on the left by shifting niftily on to his right foot to deliver an ideal cross. And then Maupay, having found space with some deft movement away from Arsenal’s defenders, glanced a header into the corner beyond the reach of Leno. All very accomplished, in the image of their overall performance here. A superbly directed header from 10 yards after a lovely cross from the left by Mooy!79 min: Mooy finds Maupay with a canny disguised pass. David Luiz makes an important block.76 min:Delightful play by Propper and Alzate to work the latter into a prime crossing position. But then Alzate tries one trick too many and confuses himself, allowing the ball to dribble out of play.Brighton substitution: Montoya on, Connolly off. That suggest a change of tack from Potter.74 min: This match is in the balance. Arsenal are looking the more sprightly but Brighton still have the ability to create chances. There’s no telling how this is going to play out. Anyone know where a man could get a good Probability Indicator?Arsenal substitution: Tierney on, Kolasinac off. I believe that change was already in the pipeline before Koalsinac got that knock - he doesn’t appear to be seriously injured.71 min: Another burst forward by Kolasinac ends with him being caught late by Alzate, who’s lucky to avoid a booking. 69 min: Lacazette retrieves a hopeful pass chucked into the channel by Sokratis. He looks up and presents the ball to Ozil about 25 yards out. Ozil goes for the first time shot but doesn’t catch it properly.68 min: David Luiz booked for taking out Connolly to abort a counter-attack.67 min: Dunk goofs mid-way inside the Arsenal half and has the ball ripped off him. Pépé hurtles forward and then nips a nice ball through to Aubameyang, whose shot on the run is deflected out for a corner.63 min: GOAL? Ozil floats in a freekick from the right and David Luiz is free to sidefoot a volley in from 15 yards! But he was a couple of yards offside so expect VAR to overrule it .... eventually.62 min: Lovey dainty cross from the right by Alzate after a flowing move. Mooy leaps above Bellerin to get a good downward header in from eight yards. Leno pushes it out for a corner! 61 min: Brighton take the corner short, then Xhaka clears Mooy’s cross. Gross cops a booking for deliberately handling the ball to curtail a counter-attack. 60 min: Gross cruises through midfield and slips in Mooy, whose shot from the edge of the area cannons off a defender and goes out for a corner.58 min: Torreira seems to have injured himself whilst fouling Connolly.58 min: Kolasinac is getting stuck into Brighton like they’re a pair of knife-wielding car-jackers. Aubameyang narrowly fails to get a touch to his latest cross from the left.55 min: Superb work by Bellerin down the right, followed by a cracking cross. Webster gets enough of a touch on it ti deviate it away from Aubameyang, who would have had a tap-in. 54 min: Ljungberg evidently located Arsenal’s mojo at half-time because they’ve come out with fresh intensity in this half and have already posed Brighton more problems than they did in the whole of the first period.52 min: Brighton’s counter-attack. Connolly has Mooy coming in offering support on the left but he doesn’t see him and goes for goal himself. His shot from the edge of the box goes wide off a defender.Ozil’s corner is flicked on at the heat post by Lacazette and it goes in off the far post. Kolasinac jumped but didn’t need to it help it over the line, which is just as well, as he may have been offside. 50 min: Pépé supplies the overlapping Bellerin, whose cross is deflected out for a corner. 49 min: Strong run by Pépé down the right - he’s made a positive impact so far, adding much-needed thrust and urgency to Arsenal’s attack. But his concluding pass this time falls short of Ozil.47 min:Pépé’s first contribution is a dinky exchange with Ozil, which enables him to win a corner. Ozil’s delivery is cleared by Burn. Arsenal substitution: Pépé on, Willock off. According to Clive Tyldsley, the new comers “has just gone through the most languid warm-up I have ever seen.”“I was listening to one of those learned podcasts we’re always being encouraged to improve ourselves with, and it turns out that Hope hasn’t always had a good press among the philosophers,” lectures Charles Antaki. “Apparently there’s some feeling that Zeus arranged that it should remain in Pandora’s box of vices precisely because it was the most pernicious of the lot. Nietzsche didn’t think much of it either. And now legions of Arsenal fans.” Don’t fret, Charles: Pepe is about to come on ....“Booooooooo!” is the familiar verdict from home fans. Their team have been disjointed and slow, the total opposite of Brighton, who have had the majority of possession and been clever and constructive with it. They know what they’re doing, whereas Arsenal have got nothing but spasmodic bluster and glimpses of talent. The Probability Indicator say Brighton are cruising to victory here, Ljungberg isn’t getting this job full-time and the New Manager will have his work cut out.45 min: Sokratis booked for sliding into to the back of Connolly’s legs near the corner flag. 44 min: Aubameyang sends over another useful cross from the right. It comes to Lacazette, who goes down under a light challenge by Webster. No penalty, reckons the referee. At first look that seems right.41 min: Connolly collects a nice pass from Mooy but is too slow to feed Maupay. Otherwise Brighton would have surely been in for goal number two. 40 min: Aubameyang leaves Burn for dead down the right and then measures out a fine cross. Lacazette meets it with a header seven yards out ... and Ryan makes an excellent save! Much better from Arsenal! 39 min: Brighton stream forward anew, and Arsenal are lucky that the final ball towards Connolly is overhit. “The Arsenal back line simply retreats and retreats,” notes Mary Waltz. “Don’t they know how to challenge a onrushing attacker?” In fairness to them, they are getting zero protection from midfield - Brighton are free to run at them in numbers.37 min: The sound you can hear is either Arsenal fans whingeing or the Amazon Probability Indicator smashing into a million useless pieces on the ground after being chucked out of a window with righteous vigour ....That’s been coming! Brun nods a corner to the edge of the six-yad box, where Connolly took it down and tried to shoot on the swivel. It as taken off his foot by a defender but fell to Webster, who swept it into the net from eight yards! 35 min: David Luiz, spooked by Connolly’s ferocious pressing, donks the ball straight out of play for a Brighton throw-in, then throws his hands up at the lack of options provided by teammates. Arsenal fans’ grumbling is growing louder ...34 min: Propper canters through midfield and has a pop from 20 yards. Leno makes another save. Arsenal are increasingly nervous and ragged, other than their goalkeeper.33 min: Maupay lets fly from 25 yards after a quickly taken Brighton freekick. While Arsenal’s defenders dozed, Leno was alert enough to e to his left and push the ball away.

They all have real jobs, your family. They all do normal things and have normal salaries and are normal. “How’s … what is it again, writing?” they ask. And I nod and say: good, yeah. “What sort of thing do you write about?” I am picking all of the Bounty bars out of the box of Celebrations as a stalling method. I am trying not to make eye contact with my little cousin, who just told us about his karate brown-and-white belt. The Christmas music seems to have tapered off. My voice breaks a little, goes soft. “Josh Brolin’s sunburned arsehole,” I tell them, quietly. My aunt says she didn’t quite catch that. Could I repeat it? And in a loud voice, directly into Val’s ear, I have to tell her: JOSH BROLIN’S SUNBURNED ARSEHOLE.Listen, Brolin sunburned his arsehole, allegedly, and we need to look into this, so to speak. To set this up: a recent wellness trend is to sun your perineum, because … I don’t know, the perineum is good at absorbing sunlight? I don’t know. Josh Brolin says he tried it. On Instagram this week, he wrote: “Tried this perineum sunning that I’ve been hearing about and my suggestion is DO NOT do it as long as I did. My pucker hole is crazy burned and I was going to spend the day shopping with my family and instead I’m icing and using aloe and burn creams because of the severity of the pain.” He then went on to use three premium-quality swearwords in a 15-word sentence before dropping the hashtag “#santamonicafiredepartment”. Johnny Knoxville commented: “Taint’ that a shame.” He’s very famous, Val, OK! He was on Jackass! I know you know what Jackass is!Let’s work through your questions methodically and in order, shall we?Do we truly believe Josh Brolin, Thanos from s of the Galaxy, gruff no-eyed everyman and Oscar nominee, burned his tenderness so severely that he had to slide a handful of aloe gel in there and just hope for the best?On the one hand, I do not feel that Brolin did expose his hole directly to the sun. The evidence for this is thus: Brolin is known to be quite a weird, anarchic presence on Instagram, a refreshing antidote to the more PR-approved, comments-workshopped, wrinkles-erased work of his peers. Saying you pelted your anus with the raw power of the sun works easily into that Brolin accompanied the caption with a generic photograph of someone (not him) sunning themselves, anally. It was more a cautionary tale than an actual document of his life as he is living it if you burned your arsehole, would you tell anyone about it?But then a small part of me believes that, yes, Brolin did expose himself to the sun, and it went wayward. Previous form suggests Brolin is a comfortable nudist he lives in Los Angeles, where people do that sort of thing if the sun was there, and the trend to expose your penny to it was prevalent, and you had access to the sort of wide-ranging garden space or balcony that might allow you to do such a thing in relative privacy, would you not try it also? I think everyone around this table can agree that if we had enough sun in this country we would singe ourselves raw under the power of it. No, I won’t lower my voice! I don’t care if I’m talking over the Queen’s speech! Pause it if it’s that important to you!How is this the fault of Shailene Woodley from the doomed YA film series Divergent?It isn’t, directly, but she is a famed pioneer of intimate sunburn, so I am choosing to connect the dots. If you don’t remember Woodley from her pre-Big Little Lies days, her previous form was a sort of proto-Paltrow who clattered through press engagements talking about nature and moss and the idea of water having chemicals in it and things like that. She was big “I have an oil for that” energy, The Girl In Your Halls Who Wore Harem Pants And Didn’t Talk About Her Dad’s Finance Job. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that, well: “I like to give my vagina a little vitamin D. I was reading an article written by a herbalist I studied about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there’s nothing better than vitamin D. If you’re feeling depleted, go in the sun for an hour and see how much energy you get. Or, if you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine.”No, I ... no, I know you can put a good word in for me at the shop, but really I think the writing thing is –What is “perineum sunning”? Is Perineum Sunning married? What is Perineum Sunning’s net worth?As wellness trends go, PS is one of those that sort of is a trend and very much isn’t, in that exactly one wellness blogger (“Metaphysical Meagan”) has extolled the virtues of it, posting about it in mid-November and saying it was an “ancient Taoist practice that originated in the Far East” (ancient Taoists were revolving in their graves at high speed, horned up and furious that modern wellness bloggers are saying that they spent their lives pointing themselves anus-first towards the sun). The New York Post picked up the idea and linked it tenuously to the 1986 book The Tao of Sexology. Basically, no one really thinks this is a good idea and no one really does it. But it only takes one, doesn’t it? It only takes one person to be wellness-influenced into mooning the sun and someone will figure a way to make a billion dollars out of it (“Don’t get caught sunning without your Schurr’s Intimate Crystal™ – a smooth and comfortable quartz plug that intensifies the sun’s healing rays”).Maybe we are all wrong. Maybe in five years’ time we will all be in the local park, heads down, asses up, saluting the sun in the worst possible way. Maybe I am the idiot and Josh Brolin, tenderly sitting on a bag of ice wrapped in a tea towel, is a galactic-brained pioneer.Wouldn’t you think that flaring your cheeks open and pointing the tender in-between bit at the most powerful force in our universe would lead, quite naturally, to sunburn?My concern with this is that the sun is really bad for your skin, even in winter. If you leave the house without sunblock on, you are just asking to age prematurely. And that’s your face I’m talking about. We have not even explored the idea of trying to turn the nozzle round on the Ambre Solaire and honk a mist of factor 50 directly into the depths. If Brolin did expose his piece to the sun, then surely now he must have the anus of an 80- or 90-year-old man, an anus in shreds, an anus on the absolute edge.So the takeaway lesson from this is: probably let’s not sun our perineums. Take a vitamin D tablet if you need sunlight so bad. Yes, Val, I’ll look into adult education. Yes, I know it’s not too late to retrain. Yeah, I – no, maybe I could look into teaching, something like that. Something normal. I’ll make you proud one day, I promise. I’ll make you stop being so ashamed of me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd9affef26fde9e6462052538546f29b9cf6b3e/0_299_5676_3406/master/5676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e724bee45222b1f6f404a8c4e91d5c","title":"camila cabello romance review syco","story":"(Simco)The singer’s second solo album is too heavy on the Auto-Tune, giving cyborg sheen to what should be heartfelt love songsThe last few years have been intriguing ones for pop. As noted in a recent  piece, a new wave of writers has emerged, rightly determined to overturn the longstanding critical bias against the genre. Under their influence, pop has been freighted with great sociopolitical import, its stars recast not as marionettes at the mercy of the music industry but as auteur figures. Under the circumstances, you can see why Camila Cabello has talked up the follow-up to her platinum-selling solo debut as something more than a mere collection of songs. “I was very intentional about the world I was creating,” she told one fashion magazine. “I made mood boards, I brought posters into the studio to set the vibe. It was the first time I’d done something like that.” What did the mood boards show, wondered the interviewer. “Lots of people kissing,” offered Cabello.If you think there’s a certain bathos in that statement, or that it’s not strictly necessary for a pop star to intentionally create a world, make mood boards, etc, to record an album of love songs, then you haven’t been paying close attention to the gossip rags. Romance’s arrival was trailed by Señorita, a bit of beach bar-friendly summer fluff that went to No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic. It offered the Latin pop of Cabello’s fantastic 2017 single Havana – a breakthrough smash that smartly underlined her Cuban roots – viewed through a Vaseline-smeared lens. The hook was an inescapable ear worm, but you did wonder how on earth it needed eight songwriters – including Charli XCX and one member of Clean Bandit – to come up with something so insubstantial. No matter: its success was bolstered by widespread speculation about whether Cabello and Shawn Mendes, her duet partner and video co-star, were actually at it in real life. In the ensuing months, every cameraphone-captured public snog, every soppy Instagram message and every hot denial that the relationship was a publicity stunt has been breathlessly reported. Under the circumstances, Cabello announcing that her new album is about love counts as a canny move. If the public are going to pruriently speculate about your private life, then why not play on it?Anyone in search of salacious titbits regarding the CabelloMendez hook-up is going to go home hungry. We learn that Mendes is a vast improvement on Cabello’s last partner, of whom more later, but the lyrics stick largely to generalisations of the “Got me beggin’ you for more” variety, peppered with proclamations of undying love, some of which are confusingly expressed. “When you touch me,” she cries on Living Proof, “paint me like a Van Gogh.” Dressed as a 19th-century Belgian peasant? Smoking a pipe? Eating a potato?The music, meanwhile, dials down the Latin inflections of her debut, although there’s some flamenco-styled guitar and handclapping here and there, and fizzy Carlos Santana-ish soloing on Should’ve Said It, a track with a melody indebted to En Vogue’s Don’t Let Go. Everywhere else, Romance wheels out the current pop bag of tricks, from Sia-esque soaring choruses to field recordings of West African singing.Sometimes this approach works really well. Shameless is an exercise in mounting tension that slowly builds from an opening inspired by the xx and never quite explodes into the balls-out arena rock you expect. My Oh My enlists North Carolina rapper DaBaby for three minutes of campy 1950s horror-movie soundtrack fun, replete with sampled screams. And the album can be dazzling in its ruthless sense of purpose: the closing First Man is an effective tearjerker in which a new bride addresses her father, which may well end up where it clearly wants to be, as a staple of wedding dances.Sometimes, however, the songwriting is just so-so. Bad Kind of Butterflies slips in one ear and out of the other, leaving no trace Liar is a attempt to meld mariachi horns with the tinny Euro-reggae of Ace of Base, a cocktail that is no more appetising in practice than it looks on paper. You may find yourself questioning some of the production choices, not least the decision to use Auto-Tune not as a special effect but as a kind of cure-all lotion slathered over every syllable that passes Cabello’s lips. After a while, it becomes distracting and counter-productive: a cyborg sheen on what are ostensibly heartfelt songs of burgeoning new love.On Easy, Cabello contrasts said new love with her previous relationship: “I always thought I was hard to love until you made it seem so easy.” There’s a certain knife-twisting wit there, given that her previous relationship was with a self-styled relationship guru, the implication being that “the world’s leading dating advice expert for women”, as his YouTube channel bills him, may want to reconsider how much of a world-leading expert he is. Of course, you need to know the backstory to get the full effect. But then, it’s difficult to imagine anyone who buys Romance not knowing the backstory: that’s rather the point, the means by which a flawed album seems destined for smash-hit status.Paul Weller – In Another RoomIt’s worth considering for a moment how unlikely the idea of Paul Weller releasing an EP of musique concrète experimentation on a leftfield electronic label would once have seemed. The results are appealingly eerie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57928ec08588b4b2afb3503bdb667578c467a22e/0_1314_2823_1694/master/2823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca06bd1e8f715847396b7075a09a144b","title":"superfan abba shrine recreated for exhibition","story":"Andrew Boardman shares 44-year devotion to supergroup as part of O2 immersive showAndrew Boardman is overcome with emotion as he stares at the cornucopia of Abba singles, albums, cassettes, videos, DVDs, posters, magazines, books, dolls, mugs, calendars, pendants, mugs, T-shirts, badges, posters, baubles, colouring books, games and dolls assembled behind glass windows at the O2 in London.“It does look phenomenal like that, I must admit,” he said. “It is amazing to see it out like it is … it’s 44 years.”Boardman, an Abba superfan, is looking at a collection that normally lives, shrine-like, in the front room of his mother’s house in Manchester. “I’ve missed it. I spend hours with it at mum’s when I go round.”The room has been recreated as part of an immersive show that tells the story of the Swedish supergroup and its four members: Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson.The exhibition, which opens to the public on Friday, takes up 1,300 sq metres (14,000 sq ft) of space which has previously been used for popular culture shows on Elvis, Prince and Star Wars.It includes artefacts, photographs, videos, interviews, costumes and private letters, many of them going on display for the first time, as well as replicas of things organisers could not quite get their hands on – the scoreboard for Abba’s Eurovision win at the Brighton Dome in 1974, for example, and the helicopter on the front of the album Arrival.Boardman has been a fan since hearing the intro to I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do on the radio as a 12-year-old in 1975. “There was something … it’s stuck with me for the rest of my life, it just really clicked. There was a sound and from then on I was hooked.”He soon got morning and evening paper rounds for money to spend on anything Abba-related. And he has not stopped since: “It has been my life’s passion, you could pick any item and I could tell you where I got it, when I got it.”When video recorders came in, his mum would shout “they’re on”, and Boardman would run down to tape any Abba TV appearance.Boardman thinks he has about 2,500 items and has spent about £50,000 over the years. He listens to Abba all the time. “It upsets everyone, but so what? I travel all over the north and I have them on constantly,” he said.The exhibition is a much bigger version of a show at the Southbank Centre staged two years by its then artistic director, Jude Kelly, to mark the end of a year of Nordic arts and culture. “The Abba team loved how seriously we took their story,” Kelly said. “They asked how would I approach it if it had a much bigger footprint.”The O2 show opens with a room of newspaper headlines and film clips giving people a sense of Britain in 1974. It will either be a jolt of nostalgia, or an education.The snapshot clips include footage from the Daily Mirror gala super girl beauty contest in Stoke-on-Trent Eddie Waring presenting It’s a Knockout in the rain alien metal monsters chuckling at primitive humans for eating potatoes rather than dried nuggets and Edward Heath warning people “in terms of comfort, we shall have a harder Christmas than we have known since the war”.The exhibition, which includes an audio guide narrated by the broadcaster Gemma Cairney, tells the Abba story though the band’s eight studio albums. The Ring Ring room has 30 interactive 1970s telephones, for example, while Voulez-Vous has a nightclub disco vibe.Abba split up in 1983 but with a museum in Stockholm, a theatre production, two movies and a recently opened dinner and theatre party experience, also at the O2, the band’s profile seems to have grown rather than diminish.In a statement, Lyngstad said she could not wait for fans to enjoy the exhibition’s surprises. “From our Eurovision song contest win in Brighton in 74 to the present day, the UK has long held a special place in Abba’s heart, and we have always strongly felt the love and support of our British fans.”• Abba: Super Troupers the Exhibition is at the O2 in London, from 6 December 2019 to 31 August 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5da1b1bd0ff30d83b33fdbda4fa87a8a707e2803/0_0_4186_3285/master/4186.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=40da1bbb324beb6ea7dbe86f9cde89ce 1400w","title":"andrea jenkyns gets salary for thinktank that does not yet exist","story":"Tory candidate paid £25,000 a year from University of Bolton for ‘institute’ launching next yearA Conservative parliamentary candidate has been criticised for being paid £25,000 a year to head up a university thinktank that does not yet exist.Andrea Jenkyns, who was MP for the West Yorkshire constituency of Morley and Outwood and is standing for re-election, has been receiving payments from the University of Bolton since July for her role in the venture.Details were first uncovered by Research Professional News in the parliamentary register of MPs’ financial interests, which records income received by MPs in addition to their main salary.According to an entry in the register for 5 November, Jenkyns is being paid £25,000 per year for her role as director of the National Centre for Higher Education Policy, University of Bolton, but there appears to be no mention of the centre or Jenkyns’ role in it on the university website and there has been no public announcement of the role.The payments to Jenkyns, for eight hours’ work a week, began at the start of July.A spokesman for the university confirmed that Jenkyns had brought the idea of the new policy thinktank to the university, but it was “still being formulated” and would be launched next year. “Andrea and her team are currently laying down the basis, defining the objectives and strategies and recruiting members of the team,” he said.“We will not comment on payments made to anyone who works with the university, but we will be happy to give more detail about the thinktank when it is launched in the new year.”The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, challenged Jenkyns’ record on education and said: “Andrea Jenkyns has serious questions to answer over her relationship with Bolton University.“If she actually cared about the prospects of children in Morley and Outwood she would have voted against the Conservatives’ cuts to schools and youth services instead of supporting them time after time.”Deanne Ferguson, the Labour candidate standing against Jenkyns in Morley and Outwood, added: “Living in the constituency most of my life, I think the people here will find it hard to swallow that an MP earning almost £80k a year needs an additional salary.“The £25k additional salary quoted is around the average earnings for many of my constituents, but those working across the care sector on zero-hours contracts or in retail may only dream of even earning that amount.”Jenkyns, a prominent Brexiter, held the seat in 2017 with a majority of 2,104 votes, after unseating the then shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, in 2015 by 422 votes. In a statement to the , she said the new thinktank would be called Rise – the Research Institute for Social Mobility and Education. “Social mobility is a big passion of mine, having been the first in my family to go to university, and having started at Greggs bakery at 16 and working my way up into management in the retail sector.”She said she had been the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for education and was also involved in the social mobility group. “The University of Bolton has already done some fantastic work in this area and is a very inclusive university. We have recruited some well-known and respected leaders in the education sector.”The university recently advertised a London-based job for a research associate for Rise on a site which recruits people who want to work for an MP. “Rise is a thinktank based within the National Centre for Higher Education Policy,” Jenkyns told the . “It will have its main office within the University of Bolton and in London, to reflect its national reach.”On the £2,000 donation by the Bolton vice-chancellor, she said: “I received a one-off donation from George Holmes in February 2019. This was a donation in his personal capacity to support my fundraising activity.”The University of Bolton languishes near the bottom of most university league tables, though its head is among the highest paid vice-chancellors in the country and has often been in the headlines. His salary now stands at £301,000 in pay and benefits, up from £295,000 the year before.Holmes was among the guests at the infamous Presidents Club men-only dinner in January 2018, which became the focus of allegations of sexual misconduct following an exposé by the Financial Times. He later issued a statement saying he had felt uncomfortable about the treatment of female staff and had raised his concerns.The University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “At a time when universities are under fire for holding down staff pay while those at the top enjoy inflation-busting pay rises … the lack of transparency around this is extraordinary.”According to 2018-19 annual accounts, which have just been published, Bolton University recorded a £2.9m deficit in 2018-19, compared with a £1m deficit the previous financial year, on total income of £61m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4704845d04c69edec082ed093af1da7c6d156b8c/57_0_647_388/master/647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f132914b09aa1c17f4d71940404204a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.”Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country.“That’s interesting,” Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. “I haven’t known much about Amnesty because I’ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an inidual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I’m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically.“For the sporting side of things, I just feel I’ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it’s just the world championship flag I’m trying to bear.”Joshua also said he would have thought twice about coming if he thought he was being used to sportswash the country. “If that was the case I’d definitely have to say I would be bothered. But my only focus is just the boxing. We looked at all different venues but this was the one – I just want to do a job.”Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn denied he was promoting the regime by bringing the fight to Saudi Arabia. “It can’t in any way be seen to be endorsing anything, other than our job to provide life-changing opportunities to our clients who take part in one of the most barbaric and dangerous sports that exist,” Hearn said.“No journalist or media outlet can possibly tell a fighter where they can’t go to earn money in a sport like this, to be honest with you. There are so many hypocrites.“Anthony is going to go down in history – like the Thrilla in Manila and the Rumble in the Jungle – two events that also had similar controversy. He’s going to be a pioneer and change the face of boxing in the Middle East.”Claims of sportswashing were also denied by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, the chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority, who maintained that staging the fight in Diriyah was instead part of a wider plan to inspire the population to do more sport and to open the country up as part of its Vision 2030 plans.“Only two years ago women were not allowed to get into these stadiums to watch a football match,” he said. “Now they are allowed and you will see a lot of women attending this fight. But it’s not just that.“They are also allowed to participate and be part of a national team. Criticism will happen. We accept it and we will look at how we can make ourselves better.“We are not perfect but we are striving towards a positive future for the kingdom and that is what we are hoping to achieve.”Addressing Amnesty’s comments directly, he said: “The way I look at it is, we’ve done a lot of changes in the past two years and I think they should embrace that. We are moving towards a better Saudi but we have to make sure we do it at the right pace and that it is within a programme that is controlled.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e4393a87ae2c10e1f13bcdc9310ae271495053/0_0_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f04ed6cec1ee476965cb275ca5b98c64","title":"talking horses sulekha varma to take charge of grand national course","story":"Doyle becomes the winning-most female jockey in a calendar year in Britain after gaining her 107th success at SouthwellHollie Doyle set a new record for wins in a year by a female jockey when she drove Class Clown to victory at Southwell on Thursday evening, her 107th success of 2019. It was a finish that allowed the 23-year-old to show off her skills as she repeatedly switched whip hands and eventually persuaded her mount to edge past a rival who was hanging into her.Though she is not one of the most demonstrative riders in the weighing room, Doyle was clearly moved by the achievement, possibly because she has had some near misses in the five days since drawing level with the record, set by Josephine Gordon two years ago. “I feel a bit emotional, actually,” Doyle said on dismounting. She described herself as “really grateful” and “very lucky”.“Two out, I thought we’d get there nice and easy, but he had to work hard for it,” she said of Class Clown. “Half a furlong out, I didn’t think we’d get by, but the penny dropped eventually.”Doyle’s year has been notable for the number and variety of trainers who have opted to use her on horses with a winning chance, so it was fitting that Class Clown should be her first success for the trainer concerned, David Barron. “I’m delighted for her,” Barron said. “She gave him a very good ride, as he wouldn’t be the most straightforward of horses, but she got him going. She is very strong in a finish.”There was also praise from the Lambourn trainer Archie Watson, whose patronage has catapulted Doyle to prominence this year, the pair of them teaming up for 42 wins. “The main thing with Hollie is she gives them a ride every time,” he said. “I know all jockeys make mistakes, but I think she makes less than most, she’s very consistent. She deserves every success, she works very hard and is a very talented jockey.”Approached for a reaction by Sky Sports Racing, Gordon was in cheerful mood. “I would have liked to have held the record longer, but I’m not going to be too fussy,” she said. “She’s a grafter and she deserves it. We’re going to see more records broken in the next couple of years by the girls and maybe it won’t be such a big deal, in time.”Hayley Turner, whose 20-year career has been a game-changer for female jockeys in Flat racing, offered her congratulations through Twitter. “Well done Hollie Doyle who today raised the bar for the lady jockeys,” tweeted the 36-year-old, who achieved 100 winners in her best year.The job of looking after the Grand National course falls vacant about four times a century, on recent trends, so Sulekha Varma is counting herself very lucky to get it at the age of just 34. “I’m over the moon,” she said on Thursday as the news began to sink in. “I’m fully aware of what a big challenge the job will be but I know how things operate there.”That’s because running Aintree during the National meeting is not a one-man job. For those three days, the Jockey Club brings its clerks of the course from around the country to Liverpool to help out, so if you walk the track you’re as likely to bump into Simon Claisse or Kirkland Tellwright as Andrew Tulloch, who has been Aintree’s clerk for the last 24 years. It’s odd to see those familiar figures of authority in the one place, working together, a bit like Avengers Assemble for racing geeks.Varma has been with the Jockey Club over the last 10 years, doing her training at Haydock and then clerking at Nottingham, Market Rasen, Warwick, Huntingdon and Hamilton. And each April, she would travel to Aintree for experience that will now stand her in excellent stead.“I’ve been there when there was a lot going on, changes, new ways of working, new protocols and procedures. My first year was Ballabriggs’s year, which brought about the changes in the pull-up area and the wash-down area. It was my job was to oversee that area and its function, once it had been redeveloped. I then moved on to assisting Andrew directly, so I was in the stewards’ box with him, running a lot of comms and being there if he got pulled away to do something else. The race after the National, I often clerked that so that he could deal with press conferences.“I’ve thankfully had a lot of experience. I think there will still be a huge amount to learn but the structure and the set-up, I have a good understanding of.”Bright and funny, Varma is one of the most approachable of Britain’s clerks and her ability to communicate and co-ordinate should be very valuable in the new role. Born in Cardiff and raised near Dundee, she can be claimed as one of their own by large parts of the country. She studied Classics at Durham University, which must be handy in inquiries when one of the more longstanding stewards starts declaiming in Latin.Equine welfare will be at the heart of her work at Aintree and Varma has long had a love of horses, having ridden since she was a child. Her first memory of the National was watching Miinnehoma win it when she was nine. Tulloch started in the role the following year.It was a work placement at Lucinda Russell’s yard that switched her on to racing. “We were packed off there for a week. One trip up the gallops and that was it, I was absolutely hooked.” She remembers riding Kerry Lads, who was twice placed in the Scottish Grand National.Between Durham and the Jockey Club, Varma was briefly a journalist at the Racing Post. The fact that she did not continue as a racing scribe reflects well on her intelligence, it could be argued. Good luck to her. The whole sport would be delighted if she got a smooth run for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9528c5dcce5d06dbd3c2cf7233119cd5c7172a/0_146_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6611f5e03fa262e9e68a50a09d96faa0","title":"fairview review jackie sibblies drury young vic","story":"Young Vic, London Directed by Nadia Latif, this Pulitzer prize-winning play by Jackie Sibblies Drury is definitely one to see – and argue overThis play by Jackie Sibblies Drury is tricky to write about. It arrives from New York garlanded with praise including the Pulitzer prize for drama. We are asked to reveal as little as possible about its endless surprises. And, since one of its key ideas is that black experience is expected to conform to white perceptions, any reservations I have would seem to reinforce its thesis. Yet, while I loved its intellectual cleverness and theatrical daring, I found myself wanting to argue with it.It starts conventionally enough. We are in a well-off African American household, sumptuously designed by Tom Scutt, preparing for a grandma’s birthday. Beverly, the hostess, is in a state of high anxiety which her husband, Dayton, vainly seeks to calm. But Beverly’s sister, Jasmine, arrives and exudes a cattily stylish superiority. Things only get worse when Jasmine intrudes in a debate about whether Beverly’s daughter, Keisha, should be allowed a gap year, and when grandma’s birthday cake goes up in flames.This is the kind of situation – the family reunion that goes wrong – that we’ve seen countless times before. But that is part of Sibblies Drury’s point: a staple of the traditional white sitcom is being applied to a black family as if the experiences were interchangeable. Sibblies Drury then goes much further in ways impossible to describe without ruining the experience. I will only say I found echoes of Caryl Churchill’s Blue Heart in the way the first scene is mimetically replayed. But, while the actors mouth the words, we hear an overlaid audio-track in which four white people debate which race they would opt for if they had a choice.Sibblies Drury develops this idea in stimulating ways. If the play has an obvious forebear, it is Branden Jacob-Jenkins’s An Octoroon (also premiered at New York’s Soho Rep), which subverted the idea that racial identity can be defined by easy labels. But Sibblies Drury’s argument about the unchallenged autonomy of white narratives comes at an odd time. Hamilton, a hit on two continents, presents a slice of American history from people of colour’s perspective. A current New York musical, Soft Power, hilariously reverses The King and I to show Hillary Clinton being re-educated by an Asian. And Ntozake Shange’s For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide, written in 1976 and lately revived, offers a moving, unfiltered portrait of black experience.Difficult as it is for me to question Sibblies Drury’s argument – about what an American critic called “the warping power of the white gaze” – I feel her play takes little account of shifts in contemporary culture. It is, however, brilliantly directed by Nadia Latif and buoyantly performed. Nicola Hughes (Beverly), Rhashan Stone (Dayton), Naana Agyei-Ampadu (Jasmine) and Donna Banya (Keisha) excellently show an affluent family in the process of disintegration. Esther Smith, Julie Dray, Matthew Needham and David Dawson represent a white society that seeks to interpret or appropriate them.This is definitely a play to see, if you can, and to argue about afterwards. It will also induce unease in white, middle-class liberals. Whether it will shock you into a new awareness – at a time when there is, especially in theatre, a hunger for inclusiveness – is something only you can decide.• At the Young Vic, London, until 18 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db0f7869fc6b62a3c56deabda1e57f45462ae4f/61_160_2806_1684/master/2806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ced0675e9dfa8ac19ec3f4e045b481","title":"elon musk trial vernon unsworth apology","story":"Vernon Unsworth, who assisted in the Thailand cave rescue, had deemed Musk’s miniature submarine a ‘PR stunt’Elon Musk’s attorney pressured a British cave explorer to apologize for criticizing Musk’s miniature submarine, in the third day of Vernon Unsworth’s defamation trial.“Do you believe Mr Musk is so cold-hearted that he was sending over this sub with no regard for the children’s lives?” Bill Price asked Vernon Unsworth in a Los Angeles federal court on Thursday. “Are you willing to apologize to Mr Musk for saying that it was just a PR stunt?”Unsworth, who brought suit against Musk after the Tesla and SpaceX chief referred to him as a “pedo guy” on Twitter, declined.“My insult was to the tube and not to Mr Musk personally,” Unsworth said. “I’m not sure how I need to apologize. It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.”After two days of testimony dominated by Musk’s global celebrity, the British cave explorer took center stage in Thursday’s proceedings. Unsworth had testified feelingly on Wednesday about the impact of being “branded a pedophile” by Musk’s tweets, which were published by an account with approximately 22 million followers. “I feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty … I was effectively given a life sentence without parole.”But under cross-examination, Unsworth’s own words were placed under the microscope. Unsworth had mocked Musk’s submarine in an interview with CNN, deeming it a “PR stunt” and saying Musk should “stick his submarine where it hurts”.Additional questioning appeared designed to undercut Unsworth’s claim to have suffered emotional distress over Musk’s words. After it was established that Unsworth had not mentioned such distress in many thousands of text messages exchanged over months with a half-dozen friends, the 64-year-old said: “I very rarely talk to my friends about my emotional issues, certainly not in text messages. I bottle it up.”Price also displayed a photo of Unsworth and other members of the British rescue team taken with Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street. “You would agree that the prime minister of England would not want to be seen with someone who is a pedophile?” Price asked.Further questions addressed Unsworth’s involvement with various film and book projects about the cave rescue. Unsworth said that he briefly engaged an agent and hoped to sell his story for a substantial sum, as others involved in the rescue have done, but none of the projects materialized.Unsworth did assist with three book projects for free, including a children’s book, and was paid a total of £2,600 ($3,400) for appearing in two documentaries, he said. Unsworth works as a financial consultant and earns approximately £25,000 annually, he testified.In his own testimony earlier this week, Musk, 48, apologized to Unsworth and said he did not believe the cave explorer was a pedophile.He also dismissed the tweets as an “off the cuff” response to watching a replay of Unsworth’s CNN interview, at a time he felt overworked from running Tesla, which makes electric cars, and SpaceX, a rocket company that offered the mini-submarine.Jurors could have the case by Friday after testimony from other witnesses and closing arguments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2582e921b9a9714c77137515de2230f61d18e4dd/214_296_1507_904/master/1507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=696a6f5249b29131fbe9c1cb70ff2ba4","title":"20 great travel gift ideas experiences for christmas","story":"Rather than buying more stuff this Christmas, why not give an active, creative or relaxing experience?

The Times currently sponsors the Julia Hartley-Brewer breakfast show and we are exploring ways to work more closely with the Times across the station.”They said the Times radio project was being overseen by Stig Abell, a former managing editor of the Sun and current editor of the Times Literary Supplement, who has experience as a broadcaster.Wright has since told listeners he had been expecting to leave at Christmas but had instead been offered more work with the station. “We were told we were going to be signing new contracts. So we’ve not been fired with immediate effect. We’re not going our separate ways as I thought might happen at Christmas.“We’re here into the new year and maybe even beyond. There’s never a dull moment on talkRadio.”News UK’s chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, has made a substantial push into radio, relaunching stations including talkRadio and Virgin Radio and moving their studios into the company’s main headquarters in London Bridge, where they sit alongside the Sun and the Times.News UK coaxed the former Radio 2 breakfast show host Chris Evans over to Virgin Radio, while also putting substantial resources into talkRadio and its sister station, talkSport.

The voter at the event in New Hampton, Iowa, who declined to give his name when questioned immediately afterwards by reporters, challenged Biden on the integrity of the business arrangement when he was Barack Obama’s vice-president.“You’re a damn liar, man,” Biden told the man. “That’s not true.” Biden denied that he or his son engaged in any corrupt activity in Ukraine and told the voter to “get your words straight”.Biden also pushed back against the voter for questioning his age. “I’m not sedentary,” Biden said. “You want to check my shape, man, let’s do pushups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. OK?” This suggestion was met with applause from the audience.As the exchange went on, Biden then appeared to say to the voter: “Look, fat.”Biden’s campaign claimed the presidential candidate was actually saying “look, fact” to correct the voter’s comments.But the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, quickly tweeted: “Joe Biden doesn’t know how to treat voters … Not only does Biden call the voter ‘a damn liar,’ he goes on to call the voter ‘fat’.”The voter who challenged Biden came in for some criticism from other attendees after the spat, with one telling him to “get out of here”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea82d60445b7df14bea1b0a9726342cdbf8632b0/0_1043_1154_691/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d66c225bb393aedce6786f8b68f1af9a","title":"all you want for christmas the high street can deliver","story":"As fairy lights and carols provide the backdrop to your hunt for the perfect gift,  Sophie Benson tells us why it’s the most wonderful time of the year to embrace your local high streetWhen the clocks go back and the afternoons begin to melt into night earlier and earlier, a comforting memory always comes back to me: it’s a late-night shopping Thursday and I’m sitting in a cafe, its walls lined with yellowing newspaper, munching on a croissant with my dad as we both warm up after spending a couple of hours wandering the fairy-lit high street in search of Christmas gifts.What did I buy on that outing? I honestly can’t remember, but it’s the experience that stays with me bundling up in mittens, hat and scarf, walking down damp cobbled streets, the Christmas lights reflected in the puddles between them, and meandering in and out of shops without any real gift in mind, just the hope that the right thing was sitting on a shelf waiting to be found.Now, approximately 20 years later, I still love to head off by myself for a few hours, particularly early in the morning or late in the evening, to soak up the festive atmosphere among the other Christmas shoppers. I set off with a list (a heading for each recipient, with a list of likes, hobbies and possible gifts beneath) and make a point of enjoying myself and savouring the experience. Rather than getting caught up in a panicked, gift-finding frenzy, I like to go at my own pace, venture off the beaten track and take my time picking through what’s on offer at each of my favourite local, independent shops on the high street.I don’t make a beeline for a specific gift instead I linger at each shelf, thumbing through books and smelling every candle. I might not end up buying the organic cotton dressing gown I hold up in front of the mirror or the pair of handmade earrings I gawp at through the cabinet glass, but I still love to browse and see what unexpectedly perfect gift might jump out at me.This spirit of discovery extends to finding new shops too. I’m notorious for “discovering” a new place only to be told that it’s been there for years. Stumbling upon a shop that’s new to me down a side street or following a sign to a tiny, almost-hidden entrance is a treat no matter how long the shop has been there. I adore finding another place to add to my roster, run by someone who cares about the local area and wants to make it a home for their business.I’m not alone in my love of gift hunting on the high street. A survey earlier this year from Visa found that the local high street remains our preferred shopping destination, despite the many different options now available. The draw of the beautifully decorated windows, the Christmas songs on repeat (yes, I love each and every one of them) and the personal experience remain hard to resist.Not only do I love the experience of the day itself, but the people make it special too. Despite the festive rush, I’ve never found myself short on help or advice. There have been plenty of times that a helpful shopkeeper, who’s noticed me circling and sighing, has come to my rescue. When I struggled to pick out a gift for a friend and colleague (who just so happened to have recently given me a wonderfully thoughtful gift that I was finding hard to match), the sales assistant in one of my favourite sustainable boutiques took the time to chat to me. She asked what my friend’s style is, what her hobbies are and what she tends to buy for other people. I left with an ostensibly mismatched but flawlessly suited bundle that included posh vegan sweets and a pin badge. She loved it.Because so many local high street shops handpick their stock, they know it back to front. They’ll tell you all about the maker, their backstory and their values. They’ll reveal all the subtly special things about a gift that in turn will make it even more special to the person who receives it. How lovely to know that a maker only uses recycled materials, for example, and then giving it to someone who does the same in their own life. Or consider how charming it is to give someone a gift made in the town where they grew up. Without attentive, considerate shopkeepers, these extra details would go overlooked and a sweet point of connection could be missed.When the provenance and details of a gift mean so much to the person selling them, so too does the sale. I adore seeing my purchase handwritten in a sales ledger and knowing that it’s significant to the person behind the till. Supporting community businesses, finding unique, personal gifts and getting festive shopping locally brings it all together for me.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes.

A court packed with loyalists gave him a green light to run indefinitely.“Given the overwhelming evidence we have found, we can confirm a series of malicious operations aimed at altering the will of the voters,” the OAS report said.OAS findings included “deliberate actions to manipulate the result of the election” that make it “impossible to validate” the official results, the report said.Morales fled to Mexico shortly after the OAS’s initial report in early November. He described the allegations of vote rigging as a political hit, saying the OAS was “in the service of the North American empire”.Bolivia’s congress in late November passed legislation to annul the contested elections and pave the way for a new vote without Morales.The interim president, Jeanine Áñez, a former conservative lawmaker, has also pledged new elections.At least 30 people have died in clashes between protesters and security forces since the 20 October election. Most have died since Morales stepped down on 10 November.

Many EU diplomats fear any second referendum leading to a remain result would mean festering isions in the UK that would block the EU from making decisions – a view Tusk strongly rejected.He blamed the former prime minister David Cameron for the “mistake” of organising the referendum that “he had no chance to win”. Tusk also revealed that when the two men spoke the morning after the vote, he still hoped the decision could be undone.Tusk said he predicted the leave victory “two or three months before the referendum” when he visited friends in Bath, who told him they were torn over their decision.A former Solidarity activist who was briefly jailed by Poland’s Soviet-controlled communist government, Tusk was the prime minister of Poland before he became European council president in 2014. In that role chairing EU summits, he found it painful to be “more a chairman than a leader” and felt frustrated that he “restrained” himself from campaigning in the UK.He has been one of the EU’s most outspoken leaders, a trait he shares with the French president. Tusk described Macron as “a hope for the future of Europe” and a true friend, but said he had problems with his “very new ideas and opinions”. As well as Macron’s comments on Nato, Tusk also objected to Macron’s rapprochement towards Russia, saying he was “disoriented” by this new narrative.The council president said he was really proud of having once been labelled “a monomaniac” about Russia by a Belgian newspaper. His term began soon after the EU agreed sanctions against Russia, following the annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine.“If we are not able to protect the Ukraine against Russian aggression it will not only be a problem for Ukraine but for Europe as a whole. My hope was that Emmanuel Macron would also be very consistent here.”Tusk, who prides himself on his knowledge of European history, was also critical of Macron’s refusal to open talks with North Macedonia and Albania. The French “non” has plunged leaders in the region into despair, including North Macedonia’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, who faced down nationalists to end a long-running name dispute with Greece.“I think it was just strategically and politically a huge mistake to say no … after so many efforts and sacrifices, especially in Skopje.”He said Europe would be less secure as a result of the decision, echoing arguments in the region that uncertainty about a European future risked triggering instability.But migration is still “the biggest problem” the EU faces, as a result of historically large numbers seeking asylum or work in Europe. Tusk said it was “presently unsolvable”, adding: “This new version of migration, the numbers, the determination of the people who want to come to Europe, it is something really new but also a permanent situation for the future.”Tusk was speaking to the  and six other European newspapers on the second day of his job as president of the European People’s party (EPP), the centre-right bloc that includes the political forces of the German chancellor and Jean-Claude Juncker.One of his most urgent tasks will be to decide whether Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party remains in the EPP. After years of foot dragging, EPP leaders set up an inquiry into the rule of law in Hungary, amid growing concern about pressure on independent media, restrictions on NGOs and Orbán’s use of the EU as “a cash register” to channel lucrative contracts to his friends and family.Tusk said he planned to issue a recommendation in February, after the inquiry team reported later this month. “It’s for Orbán to decide if wants to be part of this world of values or not,” Tusk said. “This decision should not wait another two years.”He said the biggest threat to the EU came from governments, such as Poland and Hungary, that “don’t want to treat our values seriously” while getting all the benefits of the EU. But he does not think Brussels should have more powers to tackle this problem: “Without goodwill we have no chance to survive,” he said. “But this is also the beauty of the EU.”He stressed the threat to liberal democracy was a bigger problem.Citing the 2016 US presidential race and the Brexit campaign, he said a new element in politics was “the unprecedented readiness to lie on almost everything … to treat a lie as a justifiable tool to win”. He said this “shameless” behaviour would have disqualified politicians only 10 years ago.Asked by the  to specify who he had in mind, Tusk replied: “I don’t want to be too spectacular in my first interview … I have enough problems in my own country with professional and pathological liars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/508f85ebb50149543ddbf01c1be5dd26dd73c59b/601_172_2899_1740/master/2899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22acb2e993ab9205e0858c0ea12c8678","title":"malta pm joseph muscat not convincing over resignation delay say meps","story":"Yorgen Fenech tells court Malta PM’s former chief of staff gave him updates on investigationA wealthy businessman who is the prime suspect in the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has told a court in Malta that he received regular tipoffs about the investigation from the former government chief of staff Keith Schembri.Yorgen Fenech, who was charged last week for allegedly masterminding the 2017 killing, appeared in court to seek the removal of the police chief leading the case, saying he was too close to Schembri.His testimony in a packed courtroom piled further pressure on Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who has said he will stand down next month after his party elects a new leader. The prime minister is a friend of Schembri, who resigned last week and was briefly arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released without charge and has denied any wrongdoing.Fenech has denied accusations of complicity in the murder and has instead blamed his close friend Schembri, who was Muscat’s righthand man and the architect of his two electoral victories. Fenech said Schembri had passed on information from briefings that the chief investigator, Keith Arnaud, gave at Muscat’s office. This meant he knew swiftly about key developments, including that his own phone had been tapped, Fenech said.Schembri’s lawyer did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Fenech’s testimony. Arnaud made no immediate comment but the police last week issued a statement saying there was no reason for his removal and that the investigation was proving effective.Fenech did not address the murder allegations levelled against him and is due back in court on 10 December. But he said that following his arrest, Schembri managed to pass him notes on two occasions telling him what to say in interrogations.He ignored the advice and instead implicated Schembri. At that point, he said police rushed to charge him and skated over the allegations he was making. “But all the recordings and evidence link Schembri with the murderers,” he told the court hearing.The self-confessed middleman in the murder, Melvin Theuma, who has been given legal immunity in return for providing evidence, told a court on Wednesday that Fenech was the sole mastermind behind the killing.Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat offers a presidential pardon to Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver from Birkirkara, in return for sharing potentially crucial evidence about the murder of the journalistYorgen Fenech, a prominent Maltese businessman, is arrested onboard his yacht as it is heading out to sea.Fenech is released on bail and placed under round-the-clock police surveillance.\u0026nbspThe Maltese prime minister’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the tourism minister, Konrad Mizzi, resign. The economy minister, Chris Cardona follows them. They have all denied any wrongdoing.Details emerge that one of three men awaiting trial for the murder claimed they originally planned to shoot the journalist through a window where she often sat while working at home.Schembri is released. Muscat emerges from a marathon cabinet meeting at 3am on Friday to announce he will stay in the job until the murder investigation is complete. The European parliament agrees to send an \u0027urgent mission\u0027 to Malta over the case.Fenech is charged with complicity in Caruana Galizia’s murder.Muscat resigns. In a televised address he says he will stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party is elected in January.\u0026nbspCaruana Galizia was a campaigning journalist who regularly accused government ministers and business leaders of corruption. On Thursday, a European parliament delegation to the Mediterranean country said the integrity of the murder inquiry remained at risk while Muscat was still in power.Muscat was “not convincing” over why he should delay his resignation until mid-January, said Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP who took part in a two-day emergency mission to Malta.The European parliament delegation welcomed progress in the murder inquiry but said its integrity remained at risk while Muscat stayed in office. “The next 40 days will be crucial, also for trust in the integrity of the investigation,” said a statement from the MEPs.Giegold said Muscat told the group he would not be in a position to destroy evidence in the case. The MEP described their encounter this week as “not a friendly meeting” .Giegold said Muscat seemed quite different to the “very self-confident” man he recalled from previous meetings. “This time it was totally different. He was on the defensive. He admitted misjudgment when it came to his chief of staff, Keith Schembri.”Giegold said EU leaders would find themselves in a difficult position if Muscat attended a European council summit next week. “The decision to stay on for four more weeks puts Malta into difficulty and puts Europe into difficulty, because who wants to shake hands at the Euro summit with this prime minister,” he said.The MEP said Malta’s troubles went beyond the Caruana Galizia case. He also criticised the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for not focusing on wider problems in the EU’s smallest member state.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nurses and support workers engaged in industrial action over pay, staffing levelsElizabeth Leavy (67) was left on a trolley in a hallway beside bins for six hours, court toldMen, believed to be from Albania, returned to France where they have registered as migrants\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not really here to interview for the job,\u0026rsquo Fred Barry tells Sinn F\u0026eacutein Deputy Imelda MunsterSr Consilio presented with Oireachtas Human Dignity Award for rehabilitation workTwelve-hour action at major Aldi distribution centre in Kildare was the latest in long-running series of beef price protestsChanges comes due to new early identification system of infection risk at NMHDamien English tells committee too many local authorities are failing to deliverIrish almanac predicts Kerry to win the Men\u0026rsquos All-Ireland football championshipDarren Murphy admitted manslaughter of Olivia Dunlea in Passage West in 2013Families living in emergency accommodation among those at city centre rallyMinister wants to establish if organisation \u0026lsquocomprehensively\u0026rsquo implemented changesBacklog of 20,500 people eligible for Irish citizenship waiting to be sworn in by judgeDavid Stanton reminds all operators they must run contests \u0026lsquofor a charity\u0026rsquoMichael Kearins sent inferior \u0026lsquodead ringer\u0026rsquo when one of the animals agreed on could not be soldMcGuinness says his party\u0026rsquos confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael a \u0026lsquofarce\u0026rsquoCourt told man had hugely overgrown and curled toe nails, a rare nail disease known as ram\u0026rsquos hornOver 185 people admitted to hospital for influenza treatment since start of winter flu seasonCristina Motreanu, who was born with one lung, choked to death after seizure"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4106280.1575580294!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second ifa blockade over beef prices expected in cork","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe IFA  blocking of the Aldi distribution centre at Naas, Co Kildare, on Thursday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A second Irish Farmers Association (IFA) blockade in protest over beef prices is expected to take place at an undisclosed location in Cork on Friday morning. It follows a 12-hour action at a major Aldi distribution centre in Naas, Co Kildare, on Thursday representing the latest in a long-running series of beef price demonstrations. Should it proceed Friday’s action will come just days after the resumption of the beef taskforce, the industry and farming body established to oversee previously agreed sector reforms. The IFA said it was demanding a “significant and immediate” shift in price to bring it in line with European exports. “We will continue to take action until processors give a significant price increase.”According to the IFA, Irish prices are currently 20 cent per kilogram or €80 per animal behind the Bord Bia European price tracker and 50 cent or €180 behind the UK. “The supply chain is delivering mega-profits for factories and retailers at the expense of farmers,” the association’s president Joe Healy said. “We can have all the reviews we like but farmers need a price increase now.”Although details of Friday’s blockade have not been publicised, it is likely to follow the same 12-hour model and come under the official IFA banner. Outside Aldi two tractors, a flatbed trailer and three large bales of hay were used to cut off access to the facility. About 100 farmers attended throughout the day. The German retailer said it was “extremely disappointed” by the protest, and that it had a policy of open communications with stakeholders, including the IFA. BlockadesThe move followed recent tractor protests in Dublin city by “independent” farmers as well as factory blockades last summer. During those events the IFA was criticised for its lack of participation. Representative body Meat Industry Ireland (MII) said the IFA blockade was “an irresponsible and completely unjustified stunt”, and accused it of undermining efforts to resolve the crisis at an official level. “Disrupting normal business operations and harming the livelihoods of associated service providers does nothing to help the market situation,” it said .Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said on Thursday that farmers “should be paid the maximum price the market will allow”, and urged positive engagement through producer organisations and the beef market taskforce A number of industry sources pointed out that the IFA blockade coincided with a report published in the Irish Farmers Journal noting an imminent rise in beef prices. The Journal reported that during Tuesday’s beef taskforce meeting MII accepted that rising prices in key export markets should result in “positive price developments soon”. However, it added that a lack of a solid commitment to an immediate increase has angered farmers. RetailersThe Beef Plan Movement, another group agitating for price increases and sector reforms, said the IFA action was “regrettable” as Aldi, unlike many other retailers, had recently come out in support of Irish beef farmers. The supermarket chain, it said, was undertaking to work with the beef taskforce. “Why has the IFA chosen to protest outside a retailer who has given a firm commitment to work with and support Irish beef farmers?” it said.

Boghosian and others have developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces real-life wealth inequalities in a wide range of free-market countries.This model also shows that in a pure free-market economy, ie in the absence of wealth redistribution mechanisms, all the wealth inevitably falls into the hands of one or a few people (an oligarchy).Mathematical analysis such as this is critically important today because wealth inequality is escalating across the world (eg Russia, India, Brazil), particularly in the United States. Boghosian quotes the report from investment bank Credit Suisse\u0026nbspthat the fraction of global household wealth owned by the richest 1 per cent of the world’s population increased from 42.5 per cent to 47.2 per cent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. Today,\u0026nbspOxfam estimates that 26 iniduals own as much household wealth as the entire bottom half of the world’s population – about 3.5 billion people.The most striking thing to me about Boghosian’s paper is the mathematical description of wealth distribution in a pure free-market system. In this economy innumerable pairs of people sell and buy goods to and from each other over and over again, agree on a price and shake hands. Assuming the system is initially symmetrical, ie everyone starts out with equal wealth, everyone acts fairly and everyone is equally industrious and bright, how will it evolve?Initial symmetry brokenWell, amazingly, to me anyway, mathematics shows that, once the initial symmetry is broken, which inevitably happens (despite their best intentions, some people will either overpay or accept less than an item is worth, thereby transferring some wealth between them), further transactions inexorably transfer all the wealth into the hands of a few iniduals, an oligarchy, and everybody else ends up with little or nothing. Living in a pure free-market is, for the great majority of people, like gambling in a casino rigged to favour the house.Of course oligarchies don’t usually arise in real-world economies because pure free-markets are subjected to modification through government-enforced redistribution of wealth from the richer to the poorer. When the mathematical model described by Boghosian is modified to accommodate typical mechanisms for redistribution of wealth, wealth distribution stabilises and oligarchies don’t appear. Applying this mathematical model to real world economies predicts the empirical data on wealth distribution in America and Europe between 1989 and 2016 with better than 2 per cent accuracy.Wealthy people enjoy various wealth-attained advantages relative to poorer people, for example lower interest rates on loans and availability of money to buy when prices are low. Factoring wealth-attained advantage into the mathematical model, and a factor to accommodate negative wealth (some people are in debt), further improves the model’s ability to predict empirical wealth distribution data.Boghosian’s modelIn Boghosian’s mathematical model, no wealthy oligarchy is possible when wealth-attained advantage is less than wealth redistribution, but when it is greater than wealth redistribution oligarchy suddenly appears. Boghosian explains that this is probably what happened when the USSR finally broke up in 1991.The former USSR republics suddenly experienced dramatically reduced government wealth redistribution, coinciding with a sharp increase in wealth-attained advantage from privatisation and deregulation. This threw these countries into a wealth-condensing state and many quickly became partial oligarchies.Boghosian’s mathematical model offers a powerful means of analysing wealth distribution in market economies, allowing governments to adjust wealth redistribution and wealth-attained advantage to ensure equitable distribution of wealth and to avoid conditions that would precipitate the emergence of oligarchies or economic stagnation (overdoing wealth redistribution would create economic stagnation, penalising everybody).Startlingly counterintuitiveThe mathematical demonstration that a pure free-market economy concentrates almost all wealth in the hands of a few, regardless of the industry or cleverness of the rest, is startlingly counterintuitive. Wealth redistribution is therefore absolutely required on scientific grounds, not exclusively on ethical-philosophical grounds, in order to set limits on inequality and to give everyone a chance to thrive.So much for the traditional notion, popular in some quarters, that redistribution of wealth is soft-hearted generosity that panders to the lazy and the shiftless and penalises the clever and the industrious. In the absence of redistribution almost everybody suffers grievously, the lazy and the industrious alike.William Reville is an emeritus professor of biochemistry at UCC"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104810.1575481400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders to discuss next phase of brexit at brussels summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCurrent EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier: he has been reappointed to co-ordinate negotiations on the future relationship with the UK.

It should be clear then after a night of counting whether prime minister Boris Johnson has the clear majority he needs to pass the withdrawal agreement, and the leaders will discuss any immediate challenges arising.The UK is due to leave the EU on January 31st if the Commons approves the withdrawal agreement, and then enters a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the old rulesrights still apply.If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the end of January, the UK crashes out in a no-deal scenario or may be allowed another extension if sought.The draft conclusions say the EU “reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations”.MandateTo that end the summit will mandate the commission to urgently propose a detailed mandate for the talks to the general affairs council of Europe ministers: “Negotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition.”\u0026nbspThe aspiration to conclude such talks by the end of 2020 will be welcome in London, although there is no guarantee that the timeframe will actually be achieved.The leaders will charge the general affairs council, their ambassadors to the EU, and a specialist working group to oversee the negotiating process led by Mr Barnier “in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states”, replicating the approach taken in the first phase of talks on the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A correction may be on the way\u0026nbspSterling has skipped up to a seven month high, bursting through the $1.30 line, a level it hasn’t been at since May.

It was actually revised up a bit, to 49.3 from a flash estimate of 48.6, which is better than a kick in the teeth.\u0026nbspIt stood at 50 (flat) last month. New business, meanwhile, contracted for the third month in a row, and at the fastest rate since July 2016.\u0026nbspGiven the sector’s dominance, all this bodes ill for the UK economy.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t played much of a role during the General Election but if it carries on like it this\u0026nbspit’ll be getting a lot more attention in the aftermath.\u0026nbspPolitics is behind both the gloomy picture painted of how its biggest component is performing\u0026nbspby the PMI. It’s also behind the pound’s rise from its unhealthy position on the ropes. \u0026nbspCurrency traders think it’s in the bag for Boris Johnson, that he’ll get his dismal “deal” through and that the risks of chaos will be diminished as a result. Not being overly fond of Jeremy Corbyn, they’re also quite pleased to see Labour’s poll ratings becalmed.\u0026nbspThey may be missing the bigger picture given the fraught negotiations on trade that will follow and play a big role in sentiment moving forward. How often does that need repeating? Quite a lot, it seems.\u0026nbspThe UK will simply swapping one form of uncertainty for another if Johnson wins a majority. That helps to explain why the services sector remains so weak and may continue to be weak until there is something resembling clarity on the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner.\u0026nbspOne of the many tragedies of Brexit is how little attention\u0026nbspservices were given during the negotiations and how little thought has been directed towards\u0026nbspthe impact Brexit will have on this crucial sector moving forward. A pick up could be some time in coming.Consumer spending, and more government money sloshing around courtesy of higher government spending, may ultimately serve keep the official GDP number from looking too bad. They’ve rescued it in the face of gloomy PMIs, which also cover the (currently no less gloomy) construction and manufacturing sectors, in the past.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So the ambition is to encourage students to think outside the box, and imagine an interpretation of politics that could even be considered to be positive and optimistic – politics as the avoidance of conflict.\u0026nbsp“The best responses will notice that terms like ‘war’ can mean physical acts of violence, but could also include cyberwarfare, or financial piracy.

By asking this, we are looking for the candidate to think critically about experimental design, and what we can learn from the results.\u0026nbsp“For example, does the experiment have a clear hypothesis and predictions? Is it well designed to test these? Are the methods used appropriate? Does the experiment have necessary control conditions?”He added: “As well as thinking critically, we’re also looking for the candidate to think creatively, for example about how the experiment could be improved and what the results of such an experiment might tell us about how people think and how the brain works.”The advice comes as thousands of prospective students are due to attend interviews at the university this month.Dr Khan said: “There are no trick questions, everything that we ask has a purpose, and that is to show us how a student thinks and responds to new ideas and information, in an academic conversation akin to the tutorials that they will take part in if they come to Oxford to study.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New users are also able to simply lie about their age in order to set up an account.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Historically, we didn’t require people to tell us their age because we wanted Instagram to be a place where everyone can express themselves fully – irrespective of their identity,” Instagram wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbsp“In the spirit of that decision, we won’t show people’s birthday information to others in the community.”Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post.

Instagram also said it would recommend younger users to choose stronger privacy settings to prevent strangers from contacting or following them.Age information would “keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate experiences overall,” the app said.Under the US Child Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa), it is illegal for tech companies to gather data on anyone under 13. However, consumer advocacy groups claim that Facebook has consistently violated Coppa\u0026nbsp by profiting from the data collection of children.\u0026nbspFacebook apps account for nearly half of all child abuse reports“Tech companies like Facebook have built a business model based on harvesting, analysing, and selling massive amounts of user data, including the data of vulnerable people like children – putting all of us at risk,”\u0026nbspEvan Greer, campaign director at US digital rights group Fight For the Future, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast year.Beyond illegal data gathering, fears have also been raised about online child sex crimes taking place on Facebook-owned apps.A study published this week revealed that nearly half of all online child sex abuse took place across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in 2018.\u0026nbspIn the UK, around 1,000 of instances reported to the police took place on Instagram.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour.

Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water.  Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae  grows on the plastic. As it breaks down,  the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne ChiltonThis small beetle is a pest in stored grain and flour products.

This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and \u0027packing\u0027 - how things fit together.  Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour. Black spots show the wall is too thin for interference colours, indicating the bubble is about to burst! - Kym CoxInstead of swimming, this species spends its time pulsing up and down in the water. Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water.  Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae  grows on the plastic. As it breaks down,  the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne ChiltonThis small beetle is a pest in stored grain and flour products.

This year, for the first time, it also takes in the last decade, wrapping up all of the songs from the 2000s.But many users said they were unable to actually load their report. While some were able to connect as normal, others said that the Wrapped feature simply failed to load.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe issues appeared to be particularly prevalent on Android.Users said they were clicking the big ad that has appeared in the app but that nothing happened when they did.There does not appear to be any obvious fix to the problem, but force-quitting the app and opening it again could make it work. It may also be possible to access the Wrapped feature on another device.Though the special service was launched today and commemorates the end of the year, it should be possible to access the 2019 version of Wrapped for some time. That means that it should be available even if the problems take a while to fix.How to find your most played songs and artists of the year on SpotifyIt can also be accessed on the web, by heading to Spotify\u0027s devoted site.For the first year, Apple Music is also offering its own version of the tool.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because we can now see exactly what the trains would be like under Labour.Just look at the sickening month-long South Western Railway strike now unleashed by his RMT union buddies.And imagine them paralysing an entire renationalised network.PRINCE Andrew must fly to the US without delay to be questioned by the FBI.Five victims of his paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein will serve subpoenashe ever sets foot there.

Experts believe the metals come from the heating coils found in vaping devices.The European Respiratory Society, which published the case study, has now issued a new warning against vaping.The society said: “The human lungs are created to breathe clean air.”University of Manchester’s Prof Jørgen Vestbo, who co-wrote the editorial, said: “E-cigarettes are harmful. The medical profession and public should be concerned about a new wave of lung diseases.”Prof Kirk Jones said: “This patient did not have any known exposure to hard metal, so we identied the use of an e-cigarette as a possible cause.“We believe it is likely not just that this will happen again but that it has happened already but not been recognised.”Researchers found the toxic metals cobalt, nickel, aluminium, manganese, lead and chromium in the vapour released by the patient’s e-cig.They have previously been found in vapour from other e-cigarettes. Experts believe the metals come from the heating coils found in vaping devices, rather than any particular type of re-fill.Scarring cannot be cured but some patients see mild improvementthe exposure to metal dust stops and they are given steroids.Dr Rupal Shah, also from the UoC, said: “Exposure to cobalt dust is extremely rare outside of a few specic industries.“This is the first known case of a metal-induced toxicity in the lung that has followed from vaping and it has resulted in long-term, probably permanent, scarring of the patient’s lungs.“We think that only a rare subset of people exposed to cobalt will have this reaction.“But the problem is that the inflammation caused by hard metal would not be apparent to people using e-cigarettes until the scarring has become irreversible, as it did with this patient.”The case study was published in the European Respiratory Journal, which is run by European Respiratory Society.The society has now issued a new warning against using e-cigarettes as aid to quit smoking, saying other methods are safer.It said: “The human lungs are created to breathe clean air, not ‘reduced levels of toxins and carcinogens’, and the human body is not meant to be dependent on addictive drugs.“ERS cannot recommend any product that is damaging to the lungs and human health.”Prof Jørgen Vestbo, from the University of Manchester, who co-wrote the editorial, said: “Research on e-cigarettes is still less developed than it is for smoking.“However, there are a number of new studies showing that vaping affects the lungs and we are now beginning to see patients diagnosed with acute vaping-related lung disease.“The medical profession as well as the public should be concerned about a new wave of lung diseases caused by a product which is heavily promoted by the tobacco industry.”Dr Nick Hopkinson, from Imperial College London, who was not involved the case, said it may be relevant that the patient was vaping cannabis oil.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s been a shock.”Petrov and Boshirov - suspected to be travelling under aliases - arrived in the country at Gatwick Airport before getting a train from London to Salisbury.Incredible CCTV footage shows the pair - who are believed to be in the s - smiling as they stroll through the city on the day of the Skripal attack.Police said Novichok was brought into Britain in a Nina Ricci ‘Premier Jour’ perfume bottle with a specially made poison applicator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour has complained directly to the BBCaposs Director General over what it describes as slanted and biased coverage of the election.The partyaposs election chief Andrew Gwynne escalated an ongoing complaint over the BBCaposs coverage to the broadcasteraposs top dog - saying Boris Johnson had been allowed to “pick and choose” his coverage. It comes after Johnson failed to agree to a grilling from rottweiler Andrew Neil, despite the giving “clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms” as they did when Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the same programme.Mr Gwynne also pointed claimed the corporationaposs election coverage to date had “demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC’s obligations to fairness and impartiality” and demanded that this “unfairness is urgently corrected”. A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC will continue to make its own independent \" href\"http:\" rel\"nofollow\"editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.“ Hereaposs Labouraposs letter of complaint to the BBC in full. Dear Tony, I am writing to raise the Labour Party’s serious concerns over the BBC’s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC’s obligations to fairness and impartiality. That bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour’s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. Up to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. In terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. It now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer.   Despite our concerns about Andrew Neil’s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn’s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a  through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability.   This clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. But despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. This imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a signicant amount of BBC content – on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews – draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. The BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. If the Conservatives are allowed to ‘play’ or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage."},{"url":null,"title":"mum sobs puts 14p table","story":"NewsMum sobs as she puts p on table and says it is all her money in the worldRachel, from Grimsby, pulled four p pieces and six pence coins out of her pocket and cried as she told of her struggle to feed her teenage son and put a roof over his headShareCommentsByConnor LynchChris Kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mum-breaks-down-tears-puts-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics mum-sobs-puts-p-table-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Rachel hit out at politicians, saying they donapost understand what itaposs like to go without basic necessities or to struggle as a single parent. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. The single mum invited the news crew into the temporary accommodation she shares with her teenage son, Bradley, after a visit to the Rock Foundation foodbank, GrimsbyLive reports. She emptied her pockets to show how much money she had. She told the BBC through tears: “That’s all our money”. Asked what her biggest concerns are, Rachel said: “Making sure my son is fed and has a roof over his head for the time being.  “If I didn’t have him I wouldn’t be here. I know I wouldn’t. It’s because of him I’m still here.” The programme touched on votersapos distrust of politicians. Rachel said: “Sometimes I think they don’t deserve it [my vote] because they don’t get, they don’t understand, what it’s like to be without.” On the topic of Brexit, which has dominated the campaign, she said: “The situation I’m in, it can’t get any worse.”  The programme featured a number of locals who rely on community shops and foodbanks. Many told how they had no faith in the political class. Pam Hodge, of the Rock Foundation, told how Grimsby was getting “worse every year” as it battled poverty and unemployment. Askedshe knew who she would vote for on December , she said: “Not at the moment, no. And who do you believe  We see all this poverty, all this desperation, every single day. But I don’t know who I will vote for. Who do you believe ”  In Grimsby, one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. A new report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which works to tackle poverty in the UK, has found that low-income voters wield a lot of power in the upcoming election, but are largely ignored by political parties. The report said low-income voters are a large segment of the electorate, with about .million in total. Of those, .million can be characterised as swing voters. It also found that about one million Britons on low incomes - including , swing voters - are planning to vote for the first time next week. The foundation has urged political parties to listen to low-income voters, saying they have increasing power but continue to be locked out of policy-making and debate. Sixteen childrenaposs charities, led by Children in Scotland, have released an alternative election manesto, urging parties to tackle everything from poverty to climate change. The manesto urges the next government to end the benefit cap and readopt legally binding targets to reduce child poverty. Juliet Harris, Director of Together , one of the groups supporting the manesto, said: “It is shameful that in , child poverty is one of the most signicant human rights issues across the UK. Recent studies have found a rise in the number of Britons turning to foodbanks for help.

And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to peopleaposs lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.” The much-talked about exchange saw Corbyn asked by interviewer Julie Etchingham: Do you sit down to watch the Queenaposs speech ” Mr Corbyn replied: Itaposs on the morning, usually we have it on.” Ms Etchingham: “It’s not on in the morning.

Barcelona-based English teacher Audrey Mash, who is believed to have been born in the UK, collapsed when her heart stopped beating after she suffered severe hypothermia during a snowstorm in northern Spain. She lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest before being rescued and revived six hours later at Barcelona’s Vall d’Hebron Hospital. Today, hospital doctor Eduard Argudo told a press conference: “This is an exceptional case on a global scale. It is the longest cardiac arrest ever recorded in Spain.” Audrey was separated from her husband Rohan Schoeman on November  while out walking in mountains near Girona. She said: “I can’t remember anything about that weekend.” Audrey had no vital signs when she reached hospital and her kidney and lungs were not working. She was airlted off the mountain after firefighters reached the area where she had gone missing.  A special machine which performs the s of the heart and lungs helped raise her temperature to  degrees Celsius, with a defibrillator then taking over the work. Audrey was left with no brain damage, which surprised doctors given theof her cardiac arrest. The only medical problems she has been left with relate to her hypothermia damaged hands.  Doctor Argudo told the press conference: “There are practically no cases of people who have been revived after their heart has stopped for so long.” Audrey, who spent  days in hospital before being discharged, told Catalan media: “I didn’t realise my le was in danger until I was in hospital.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad adds even more christmas","story":"NewsDad adds even more Christmas lights after neighbour called his £ display ‘tacky’Billy Morgan, from Bridgwater, in Somerset received an unwelcome note from someone claiming to speak on behalf of his neighbours who said they found his Christmas light display to be \"on the verge of tacky\"ShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video dad-goes-war-neighbour-who-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news dad-adds-even-more-christmas-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mixed into the ft mound of muck is bags of clothes, cupboards, a fridge-freezer, a headboard and broken parts of a sofa. The rubbish has now been on the Birmingham pavement since Friday, November . Shaun McRobert, , said: “Most of the pathway is blocked, people are being forced to walk into the road and speeding is a really bad problem here. It’s an eyesore - having to walk past that every day is a joke. It should have been removed by now, it’s a health and safety thing.” There could be broken glass, anything inside of there, one little mistake and someone could end up getting hurt. Bader, , said he was particularly affected as the waste spilled across the front of his house. He added: It’s really bad, we have trouble getting out of the house with the prams. It’s going to attract rats, mice and it’s going to affect my house because I am the one closest.

The manager of the property behind where the rubbish was dumped said the mess was due to a previous tenant.  He said: I’m a victim, just like everybody .

December th is set to be the busiest day of the year for UK pubs with  hours of sports scheduled. The aposCEOapos at Greene Kingaposs The Globe, Baker Street, will be on hand provide punters with excuses to keep their friends and family off their case to ensure they donapost miss any football fixtures or the World Heavyweight title fight between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr. CEO Edmund Short will phone partners, parents and pals with believable excuses - from punctures to flat batteries and road closures to cancelled trains - to explain why the person in question is unable to meet them at the arranged time. In a video of the CEO in action, one football fan was aposexcusedapos from dog-sitting duties after his car supposedly broke down. Another used the pop-up service to avoid babysitting for her sister for a couple of hours, on the pretext that she was stuck in traffic and her phone battery had run down. The local derby between Manchester City and Manchester United is expected to draw the biggest viewership, followed by Everton versus Cha, and Bournemouth versus Liverpool. Chris Conchie, head of sport at Greene King, said: Super Saturday is the biggest day of the year for football and with the boxing match on the same day, there is a risk that dedicated fans might be unable to catch every minute of the action. Thereaposs nothing worse than wanting to spend time in the pub but knowing youaposre on a deadline and have to leave in the middle of the match because youaposre meant to be where. Our aposCEOapos - aposChief Excuse Officerapos - will be on hand at the bar throughout Super Saturday to aid punters in need of a quick one-liner, to ensure their place in the pub is secure all day without any distractions.  It comes after a study of , Brits found  per cent have told a aposwhite lieapos in order to escape to the pub to watch a sporting fixture. One in four adults have made a deal with their partner in the past to allow them to stay in the pub to watch a game on the big screen, while more than a third have offered to do chores around the house. And one in three have been allowed out by their other half, as long as they promised to do all the washing up when ing home. When put on the spot by a needy partner or pal trying to pry them from the pub,  per cent are most likely to say they bumped into an old friend and are unable to come home. Other popular excuses include apossomeoneaposs just offered a free roundapos, aposI owe my friend a drinkapos and aposmy friend just got dumped and I need to comfort themapos.  More than two thirds of those surveyed by OnePoll named the pub as one of their favourite venues to watch a sporting event. Around  per cent put this down to their local having a better atmosphere than their living room, while  per cent enjoy the game more with a pint in their hand. Half of those polled even use a match at the pub as an excuse to catch up with mates and  per cent said the pub has a better TV set-up for watching the match than they do at home. Chris Conchie added: This Super Saturday, Greene King pubs expect to pour around , pints to sporting fans both during the day and into the evening.  More than  Greene King pubs will be showing the footballing fixtures and Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr match. TOP  EXCUSES USED TO STAY IN THE PUB . You bumped into an old friend .

Tory Ojeda lives with three of her partners in Jacksonville, Florida, and despite being in an open relationship sheaposs the only one who has multiple partners. Seven months ago, Tory found out that she was pregnant with a baby girl who they will welcome into their unconventional family in February. She met one of her partners Marc, , in high school and then got into a relationship with Travis, , two months later. Their love story began three years ago and she has since announced her engagement to Travis in July. Then she also found love in their long-term mutual friend Ethan, , and Christopher, , who is the babyaposs father. She said: “Chris is the biological father. We just know that because of timing and when the approximate conception date was. “Based off of the approximate conception day, we had been on vacation. So it was only us. “But as far as I guess, socially goes, weaposre all raising the baby together, so everyoneaposs dad. “We’re all very, very excited to be raising a baby together.”  Tory says that her boyfriends are “welcome” to pursue other peoplethey wish to - she even encourages the idea. She told Barcroft TV: “Honestly, I would love itsomebody found a second partner. “Dividing time and figuring out schedules between all five people and making sure everyone feels included, it’s kind of dficult. “I’d like to not be the only woman in the relationship. That would definitely be nice.” They all have their own bedrooms but her partners “swap in and out” of her bed each night, making sure each of them gets an “equal turn” in spending the night with Tory.  On the issue of jealousy, Ethan said: “There are a couple of healthy ways to deal with it. Primarily just talking to each other.” She added: “Thereaposs always going to be like little moments of jealousy, it does take a certain amount of restraint and just getting relaxed. I will say it helpsyou know the person.” Reflecting on his own experiences in his current relationship, he said: “Seeing [Tory] with Ethan was a lot easier because I was friends with him. “Her and Chris was a bit dicier at first, there was a lot more jealousy and Iaposll openly admit that. The same goes for Marc because Iaposd never interacted with them.” When asked how he feels about sharing the responsibilities of being a father, Christopher said: “It’s definitely a little interesting.  “I grew up with the idea of you know, one dad, one mum. But there is a lot of support between all of us dads and it’s something we can tag team. “We always joke about the idea of getting stack in an endless loop of go ask your dad.” Despite their enthusiasm to raise a child as a five, some members of their respective families are yet to come around to their relationship and to the pregnancy news.  Tory said: “Most of my friends know all my partners and they love us and think that we’re cute and such. My family is kind of quiet about their disapproval. “Polyamory is definitely an uncommon thing.  “A lot of people have grown up in monogamy culture of, you donapost really love someoneyou have eyes for somebody .” Christopher added: “My family is slowly coming around to the idea. The pregnancy has helped with that. But at the very beginning, I know my mother and father were hesitant about it. “Her main concern was that she didnapost like the idea of me having a partner who was not fulfilled with me alone.” However Ethan’s family are “very active” in their support, along with Tory’s older brother, Alistair. Alistair said: “I will admit that since Iaposm her older brother, that I just have that tendency I suppose to be protective.  “Iaposm more so concerned that sheaposs happy, that she is in a relationship where they both love each other mutually or in this case more people love each other mutually. “I don’t see anything wrong with Tory’s relationship.” After having to overcome judgement in public spaces, Tory hopes that she will eventually see more acceptance of polyamory in wider society. “We definitely get weird looks,” she said. “I’ve had people just say rude comments when weaposve just been hanging out at a fast food place.

Shivam Kumaraposs neighbours believe he is a ine being due to the unusual growth of hairs on his back, so they shower him with chocolates and snacks.They flocked to see him as word spread after he was born in Delhi, India, and some came with flowers believing he was a reincarnation of Hanuman, a powerful monkey deity for Hindus.The growth shocked doctors and Shivamaposs parents, including his mother Reena, , refuse to shave it off because it would bring a bad omen for our family. The incessant visits took place for almost a full year before the familyaposs local guru asked them to stop letting people carry on with worshipping him as a God. The guru said it would have untold effects on his psyche in later le. Since then, the boy has been living his le normally, but continues to be pampered by his neighbours.  His mother said: Everyone loves him so much in my neighbourhood. Initially, it caused a problem for us as people would visit our house every other day which would hinder our daily lives. Our guru suggested asking people to stop this madness and let them live their le, so we followed his instructions and the people now have lessened approaching us although it has not stopped completely.  Sometimes people would come and ask about Shivam but we would deny them by saying he is not in the house. When askedthe doctors have suggested any treatment for Shivam, Reena is adamant there is nothing wrong with my son as he is perfectly healthy.  She added: This is by his birth, we know he is special but we cannot shave the hairs as it would bring a bad omen for our family. This might have been a gt of God and we do not want to tamper with any of his plans. Shivamaposs grandmother said: He acts and behaves like a monkey. He will laugh like an ape and always keep jumping.

The collection is set to grow next month, when Win will be . Originally from Pillgwenlly in Newport, South Wales, the sisters were born performers and grew up to star at Newport’s Empire Theatre. Lil, who said she had a “pitch-perfect voice at the age of two”, sang, tap danced and played the accordion. Win was part of a dance troupe and known as “the highest kicker in Wales”. Lil said: “I was fortunate to have a pitch- perfect voice at the age of two. It was like Katherine Jenkins’ but just not trained.” At the outbreak of the Second World War in , Lil and Win’s six brothers went off to join in the Navy. Lil volunteered to be a bus conductor, the first female one in Wales. She said: “Conductresses were needed during the war because of the blackout. “There were a lot of Irish boys working here who didn’t know where they were going. “We had a small lamp on our front which was the only light inside the bus. “It was so dark that you had to call out every stop, whether you could see it or not. “But we used to have a laugh on the last bus, singing songs with the boys on their way home from the pub.” After the war, Lil married and moved to South Africa with her husband Donald, a deputy post master. Like Lil, Donald also loved entertaining and the couple travelled the country performing for charities. When they ed to Wales, Lil took a three-month caretaker job in charge of the Bridge Inn, near Usk, Monmouthshire, which turned into a -year stay. She said she was the only publican in the area who would welcome blind people, as others turned them away for fear they would spill their drinks. It was only when she was well into her s that Lil stopped singing. But even now, a resident in the Willowbrook assisted living home in Bettws, Newport, she still loves to dance. Despite having had arthritis for the past few years, Lil said she had not let that get in the way of enjoying her le and doing as much as she can.And there has been plenty of new experiences over the past century.

We had managed to stay hopeful and positive for a few hours but it was horrendous and we were on the point of giving up when Gavin saw a light.“To begin with I thought he was seeing things but then I saw it too, although it kept appearing and disappearing.“We barely had any strength left but I just kept blowing desperately on a whistle. The guys on board could hear us but not see us.“They got to us just in time. Gavin was going under. They grabbed us and hauled us on board.”Seven years on and Benny is now a key member of the Broughty Ferry leboat crew, serving with coxswain Murray Brown, one of the men involved in his rescue. vw, px\"  The camaraderie between Benny and Murray is clear to see, with the banter flowing between the two, but Benny is in no doubt as to just what Murray and the other members of the leboat crews did that day.They gave him his le back and allowed him to go back to his we and children.Following his rescue, Benny decided to thank everyone involved in the best way he knew how – he became one of them.The following February, Benny went along to the Broughty crew’s open day.“I kept in regular touch with them after that and kept going along to see them. Eventually I asked to join them,” he said.“The rescue changed my entire le. I left my offshore job and became a fireman in Fe and moved to Broughty Ferry with my family.”Benny has been involved in many shouts himself now.He said: “One I found particularly hard to deal with was an -year-old girl who had fallen from the Tay Bridge. vw, px\"  “She was so young I was really affected. We got her on to the boat and I stayed with her on the way back to the station.

town","story":"Plans for a park-and-ride mini transport hub have been approved by north-east council officials.The new facility is to be built on land at Chapelpark, Oldmeldrum, and will feature  parking spaces, bicycle storage and two bus laybys.It will be next to a proposed residential development which could be made up of  new homes.A planning statement put together by AECOM Limited on behalf of the council said it would provide a boost for people travelling to and from the village.Buses using the site would not enter the facility but would pick up passengers from the nearby A Aberdeen to Turrf road.There would also be protective landscaping in place to screen the nearby St Matthew’s Church.Officials have given the facility the go-ahead and said it would improve access to public transport for people in the village and the surrounding area.The development would still be subject to six conditions, which include improving visibility at the main road, the submission of revised landscaping proposals and a new zebra crossing to be installed across the A to protect people crossing the road.The report by planning officials concluded the development would help villagers to access public transport.It said: “The proposal can be appropriately serviced, will provide an increased accessibility to sustainable public transport, and while doing so will provide a suitable level of landscaping to protect the setting of the category B-listed St Matthew’s Church.“The development therefore complies with all relevant policies of the Aberdeenshire local development plan .”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said work on the project would not go ahead until fresh landscaping proposals had been approved.She said: “Plans for a mini transport hub at Chapelpark in Oldmeldrum form part of the Local Development Plan.“It is intended to support sustainable transport options for the local community, offering access to local bus services and cycle paths.“A revised landscaping and maintenance plan is being put together for consideration by the planning service alongside other local development matters before work gets underway.”The original planning statement for the park and ride hub said it would have a “positive impact” for commuters, be a boost for travel infrastructure in the region and ease the pressure on the surrounding roads network.It said: “Overall, it is considered that the development will have a positive impact on the travel options provided to the residents of Oldmeldrum and beyond and this will form an integral part of a wider strategy to provide transport infrastructure that caters for the needs of a high-performing international city region economy and growing hinterland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help.

His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared.

It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

Scotlandrsquos educational performance, on which the country has always prided itself ndash rightly or wrongly ndash was revealed to be a dangerously leaning tower. Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has said there will more recycling vehicles available to carry out collections, as of this week, after a number of recent breakdowns.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The trees that will stand inside and outside the St Magnus Cathedral are from Grimstad and Hordaland, in Norway, respectively.Speaking during an event at the Robert Rendall building in Stromness today Mr Strømmen talked about the visit to Orkney so far — which is a first for him.He said: #There are two things that really stand out when it comes to Orkney — there is the Viking tradition and the fact that Orkney was part of Norway many hundreds of years ago. That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly.

While holding the poets aloft, championing them as national talents, it gives them room to breathe and write about whatever they choose.Editor Calum Rodger is Scottish Slam Poetry Champion , and this summer represented Scotland at the Poetry Slam World Cup. The signicant acievement received little media attention here – poets are not always very good at sending out press releases, and it’s a shame they even have to – but it was of little surprise to anyone who knows him. We work together on the co-operatively owned Gutter magazine. For years Rodger has been one of the best live performers on the scene, his words as rigorous as they are joyful. I have seen him coax a teetering, worse-for-wear literary crowd into awed silence by standing on a chair and reciting poetry word perfectly in his North Berwick accent. You can get a taste in a Tedx Talk on Youtube called Glasgow flourishes, where he says “Some would have it thought that Glasgow’s wrought from miracles. They’re wrong. It lives in stone, souls, song and syllables.”: Renfrewshire appoints first Makar: Former staff turn fire on Scottish Poetry Library management in wake of resignation of leading writersIn Rodger’s introduction to Makar Unmakar, small-press Tapsalteerie’s first full collection, he sketches the culture these poems come from. “Poetry is a shared enterprise, through such multarious activities as collaboration, translation, zine and small-press publishing, workshops, events, research, criticism, and pedagogy.” Coverage of what emerges from this petri dish usually concludes poetry is ‘thriving’ pegged on inidual poets or successful spoken-word events. But publishing, occasionally awkwardly, straddles both business and art and that in many ways shapes what emerges.Rhyming Texan lairdsMuch of what happens in collaborative, close-knit small-press scenes is, by nature and by economics, driven more by linguistic passion than by servicing commercial markets as first priority. Funding problems to one side, it’s where some really interesting and innovative writing is nurtured.Scottish art, wherever it is categorised, defined, or boundaried in any way, has always faced a see-saw of self-identity, balanced between thematic and physical claims to ‘Scottishness’. In some instances, definition takes the ‘by formation’ route, akin to the electoral rollyou live here, you’re in. Sometimes, Scottishness is defined more vaguely, fuzzy around the edges but usually with the aim of welcoming, encompassing being born, living, or having studied here, or writing explicitly with reference to Scottish terrain. : Wigtown Prize for Poetry won by Scots language entry for first time: Remembering the Scots poet described as the “worst in the world”‘Makar’, the old Scots word for poet, which has seen a resurgence in recent years with appointments of Edwin Morgan, Liz Lochhead, and Jackie Kay, is playfully balanced with ‘unmakar’. The book is respectful of these poets, but sceptical of the confines of formal roles. As Rodger describes it “Makars-with-a-capital-M who, like their courtly forebears, participate in public discourse from a position of governmental patronage or sponsorship. That contemporary Scotland supports such a role for poetry is a fact worth celebrating, but as with all our democratic institutions it should not be celebrated uncritically. This critical spirit is there in Morgan, Lochhead and Kay, to their great credit.” But, as the introdution continues, the idea of reducing the recognition and support of Scottish poetry to “a civic appelation” is at odds with the wide-ranging interests and inner world of any good poet, no matter where they live.Voices suppressed by poetry establishmentThe reader is reminded that a prior anthology, Twelve Modern Scottish Poets, was entirely male. Although it was published  years ago, there are more recent anthologies which, while marginally better, still skew overwhelmingly towards men, like the Zoo of the New. While the book sets itself up as an alternative, Rodger says the selection wasn’t gender-balanced by numbers. “Rather, it’s simply the case that much of the best poetry in Scotland today is being written by voices hitherto suppressed by the established hierarchies of the poetry world.” This has also played out in recent publishing start-ups who publish more ersely than predecessors because the scene they exist within is more erse. The world turns, slowly.You can feel the academic context Rodger and many of the contributors emerge from most strongly in the introductions to each poet, which attempts to situate them critically alongside the wheres and whats of previous work. As an avid reader, but one who gave up academia years ago, parsing meaning from the dense descriptors occasionally left me ready to shout Parkle. But it’s also a book which says to the reader: make of this what you will. There are no polemics here, no dumbings down.Language ranges from crisp, humourous, or direct in those with a knack for summing up a complex feeling and chasing it around their lines in an attempt to pin it down and others which venture into the unknown, making both the complexity of what’s around and their attempts to grasp it their theme. Juana Adcock, a rising star writer and translator, writes of “a feeling of being at home in the unknown”, Tessa Berringspeaks of “lean words, you know, like spirit, and lightly placed unspeakable things”.Another highlight is Daisy Lafargue who searches for signs in the world around and suggests, “to receive them, it helps to be empty but imbued with residual , like a disused water tower”. Maria Sledmore says “to exist here is ever to quiver”. Elsewhere, Harry Josephine Giles writes future fantasy in Scots and Alice Tarbuck makes mischief with Classical allusions. Their chosen forms y from straightforward to experimental, but each poet has given the reader a ining rod what we find with it depends on what direction we walk, led by our own associations.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

It also leaves the Scottish Parliament with potentially only weeks, instead of months, to scrutinise and debate its own budget.In a statement of intent for the first  days of a Conservative government at Westminster, Boris Johnson said today his top priorities would include a \"Brexit budget\" in February.The Tories claimed a February budget would allow Mr Johnson to deliver on a manesto commitment to cut taxes for working people.: Jo Swinson rules out working with SNPThe Scottish Government had been due to publish its draft budget for   on December . The postponement of the Westminster budget – which had been scheduled for November – had already thrown the status of the Holyrood budget into doubt.Mr Mackay said: “The Tories have a long track record of ignoring the needs of the people of Scotland, but delaying the UK budget until February – just weeks before the new financial year – is nothing short of contempt for Scotland and for devolution.“Having wrecked their own parliamentary processes, they want to damage ours too.“Under the current arrangements, we need a UK budget, before we can set the Scottish budget. Without it we are operating with both hands tied behind our back, making it impossible to plan with any certainty.“Boris Johnson clearly doesn’t understand Scotland, devolution or simple good governance.“If Boris Johnson is able to win a majority next week it will simply add to the economic uncertainty being caused by Brexit that is putting substantial strain on Scotland’s public services. The UK Government was ready to present a budget in early November, so there is no good reason to delay it for two months after the election.”The Fraser of Allander Institutesaid \"one of the ironies of fiscal devolution is that the outlook for the Scottish budget is,anything, more dependent on the outcomes of the UK budget than it was previously\".In a blog post on the issue, published last month, the FAI said: \"The spending decisions of the UK Government effect the Scottish block grant, via the Barnett Formula.\"The Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts of UK income tax revenues also affect the Scottish block grant.\"This is because the size of the deduction made to the Scottish block grantis calculated based on the forecast growth of income tax revenues in the rest of the UK.\"In turn, OBR forecasts of rUK income tax revenues also depend on UK Government tax policy decisions.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg.

It was not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland would be appalled at the latest development.He said: “Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible”.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “Procurement for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract has been hit by a number of unacceptable delays which does nothing to reassure people in the Northern Isles that the government is committed to improving our leline ferry services.“It is imperative that this dispute is resolved as soon as possible in the best interests of people in Orkney and Shetland.”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston, who lives in Orkney, also weighed in over the situation.He said: “It’s quite incredible that the SNP is being sued by oneits own quangos.“It tells you everything you need to know about the mess the SNP government has made of ferry services that a publicly owned company wants to take it to court, leading to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.“When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.” raquoCalmac have demonstrated conclusively that they are not capable of running a ferry service with their performance on the Western isles routes.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 on the doorsteps with three women who have just one thing in mind winning","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I know which box to tick next Thursday.\"Her three-year-old daughter Tammy, sporting a reindeer hat, is a tad scared of the DUP canvassers and hides behind her mum.\"Im always seeing you on TV over there in England,\" Albert Bloomer tells Little-Pengelly as he pledges his support.Albert recalls polling days many decades ago when politicians toured the area asking for support from loud-hailers on the back of lorries.\"Peter Robinson has suggested I do the same, but Ive ruled it out,\" laughs the candidate.Ear-ringed pensioner Thompson Hindes is mad keen on the DUP. \"How could I not be after this good-looking girl came on the scene \" he declares, gesturing at Little-Pengelly. Thompsons we, standing right behind, doesnt mind a bit. \"It gives me a break from him,\" she jokes.Andy and Kim Ward, out walking their little dog Wicket, stop to chat to the candidate. Their big concern is the education budget. As low income parents, theyre stretched when their childrens school asks for donations to fund trips.The couple tell Little-Pengelly theyve no problem with an Irish Language Act but think it shouldnt be publicly funded.The conversation continues until the pink-collared Wicket grows impatient and strains at the leash to move on. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula BradshawFurther up the street, the DUP MP is invited into Angelas home to warm herself on a bitterly cold afternoon. \"Poor Emma, you must be foundered,\" she says. \"Winter elections arent great,\" confesses Little-Pengelly. \"My calf muscles are sore from all the walking, even a Radox bath hasnt helped much.\" Angela sings the politicians praises for her efforts in moving her up the queue for major surgery.\"Ive just passed the -week post-op period and Emma has been in touch constantly with messages. The DUP is always there for you. With them, you feel youre not alone,\" she says.Little-Pengelly admires the cream and grey décor in Angelas immaculate living-room, her pink rug and especially her Christmas tree adorned in matching colours. \"Pale pink is very in this year,\" she remarks.\"My living room is grey and cream too, but Ive a duck egg blue rug. And you put me to shame with your beautul tree. Ive mine up, but its not decorated yet. It looks so miserable with no lights or tinsel.\"A new addition to the DUP canvassing team is William Traynor, who ran for UKIP in Mays council elections but has since joined the party. \"Its tight between Emma and the SDLPs Claire Hanna, but I really hope that we can do it,\" he says.Little-Pengelly has faced fierce criticism for becoming embroiled in arguments about UVF flags and for not building bridges in erse South Belfast, which she denies. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"I have reached out, thats what Im about, its who I am,\" she says. \"I held a constituency outreach in the Markets and an advice clinic in the Belfast Islamic Centre.\"I reached out on Twitter to the LGBT community and the GAA. Im confused about claims that I havent reached out. The DUP condemns paramilitary flags, but I try to sit down with people to address issues rather than just jumping up and down about them.\"Over in the liberal and increasingly Catholic Rosetta area, residents certainly dont see their DUP MP as a bridge-builder. At many doors shes denounced in a way that youd expect in republican Belfast, not in this middle-class and moderate district.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna doesnt bring her rival up, but voters do. \"I cant stand that woman Pengelly,\" a female householder says. \"I want to wake up on December  to find the nightmares over and we have a new MP.\"A pensioner says: \"Shes not our MP, she never was our MP. In the two years since she was elected, Ive not seen her once around these streets.\"Hannas canvassers meet outside The Frying Squad chip shop. Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there. data-dfpadtargetingLisburn Road in south BelfastThe candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election. I hope Enmma Little-Pengelly comes to my door so I can give her a piece of my mind.\"Hanna is warm and chatty as doors are opened by busy parents putting kids to bed or mums already in their pyjamas.\"Id be in mineI wasnt out here doing this,\" the candidate says. Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.\"Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.\"The compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. \"Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, an Indian woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable. South Belfast currently seems set toto the party and be represented at Westminster by a new female face."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says there is a “deepening crisis” and this winter we must be prepared for “unprecedented risks” to quality of care and patient safety. He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says there is a “deepening crisis” and this winter we must be prepared for “unprecedented risks” to quality of care and patient safety. He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera top the group on score dference, putting them into the semi-finals of the McCormick Cup and the MacRory Cup quarter-finals in February. They were beaten by Letterkenny on Tuesday, more emphatically than the - to - scoreline suggests, but their mauling of Cavan in an earlier round helped their cause. Maghera played the league stages without the injured Ronan McFaul, as well as five players preparing for Ulster Club minor action at St Pauls. googletag.cmd.push Cargins Paudie McLaughlin, as well as the Lavey quartet of James McGurk, Jamie Duggan, Matthew and Enda Downey will come back into the mix for business end of the competition.

They face an away clash with St Patricks Cavan in round  of the play-offs, after losing all three group games. The Convent got off to a poor start in their opening game with St Patricks Armagh and their storming comeback fell short. Against Omagh, they were level at the end of normal time before losing by two points. In their final game, with nothing to be gained, they led St Ronans for much of the hour before changing their team around and falling to a third defeat. googletag.cmd.push Cathair Dhoire, in their first team of le at MacRory level finished third in their group.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour. Itrsquos something Irsquove never seen before, said the councillor whose home overlooks the harbour.ldquoI am glad that the boat has finally been lted and taken away for everyonersquos benefit and safety..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Science.jpg","title":"Science student Annie in final of UK competition  ","story":"AN Assumption Grammar School student has been selected to compete at the UK finals of a science and engineering competition after her exciting project caught the judgesrsquo eye.Year  student Annie McWilliams has secured a place in this yearrsquos Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers competition which takes place next March.Annie is one of the winners of the regional heats with her project entitled lsquoThe Olympics Game for Museumsrsquo impressing the judges.As part of the project, Annie has produced a game which tests the userrsquos knowledge of the Olympic Games.Dr Hilary Leevers, Engineering UK chief executive, said Annie really impressed the judges with her project.ldquoWe are excited to see how she does at the UK finals, he said. ldquoIt is a huge achievement to progress to this stage of the competition and Annie should be incredibly proud to take up her place and compete at The Big Bang Fair in March .Approaching its th year in , The Big Bang Fair continues to be a great source of STEM inspiration for young people.Dr Leevers added: ldquoThe competition provides an amazing opportunity for young visitors, their teachers and parents to get hands-on with a wide range of activities, workshops and shows, and engage in meaningful career conversations with professionals, all designed to bring classroom learning to le and inspire the next generation.The competition finals take place at The Big Bang Fair at Birminghamrsquos NEC when Annie will vying for top prizes including the coveted title of GSK UK Young Engineer and GSK UK Young Scientist of the Year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Success.jpg","title":"Success of Saintfield community centre can drive support  ","story":"THE stunning success of Saintfieldrsquos new community centre is spearheading the drive for other available space at the Belfast Road site to be used by local people.It was revealed this week that bookings for the new centre mdash delivered by the Saintfield Development Association with the help of Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash are already ahead of projected targets.Association officials are also quietly confident that the financial sustainability of the community-run centre seems assured, with the priority for the future ensuring that the needs of local people are catered for, including classes, activities and interests for a wide range of organisations.Currently, there is a focus on developing youth provision and support for first time parents. It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record.

Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
