He said he understood both he, and the guards charged with holding him captive, were pawns in a larger conflict.“For me they were soldiers and soldiers obey the commands of their commanders. They don’t get a choice. They were there because they were ordered to come and look after me.“I don’t hate them at all. And some of them I have great respect for and, and great love for almost.”Weeks said some of the US-led rescue missions came perilously close. “A number of times they missed us only by hours.”One mission in April almost cost Weeks his life as his captors took him into an underground tunnel in the early hours of the morning, telling him Daesh (Islamic State) had arrived, when in fact it was the Navy Seals “right outside our door”.As machine-gun fire raged above, Weeks was pushed backwards into the tunnel, losing consciousness.In exchange for the release of Weeks and King, three high-profile Taliban prisoners were freed, including Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the militant group’s deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is also head of the hardline Haqqani network.The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, said the decision to agree to the swap was a hard choice but one he felt compelled to make in the interest of the Afghan people. Even once negotiated, the deal was problematic, with a number of false starts and last-minute postponements, before it finally went ahead, with the Taliban prisoners flown to Qatar.Thanking those involved in his release, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the US president, Donald Trump, Weeks said he had been profoundly changed by the experience.“The time that I spent as a hostage with the Taliban has had a profound and unimaginable effect on me,” he said.Visibly emotional, he said: “At times I felt as if my death was imminent and that I would never return to see those that I love again but by the will of God I am here, I am alive and I am safe and I am free. There is nothing else in the world that I need.”Despite the gravity of what he endured, Weeks said he never lost hope.“I had hope the whole time. I knew that I would leave that place eventually,” he said.Weeks, from Wagga Wagga, arrived back in Australia on Thursday night after being transferred from a US military base in Germany, where he underwent medical checks.King, the American held hostage alongside him, is still undergoing treatment.Weeks said he felt “great joy” that peace talks between the US and Afghan governments and the Taliban had recommenced.“I pray that they will be successful, and that they may enable the return of stability and security to the country of Afghanistan, and the region.”He appealed for privacy for his family, saying the ordeal had especially taken a toll on his father. He added that he hopes to return to academic study in the future but will take a well-deserved holiday first.The experience has left him feeling “stronger”, with a belief that he can get through anything.“It’s given me a great sense of hope and a great sense of confidence,” he said.Alyssa Carter said the emotional family reunion after almost 1,200 days was “incredible”, while Jo Carter said what her brother had been through was “unimaginable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842255a63bedc1917efbe252b993d4ea692fc8ac/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c18df6132493d3e99f0722ca22f9c1c","title":"best books 2019 picked by years best writers","story":"From The Testaments to a tale of British imperial looting, the winners and runners-up of this year’s most coveted literary awards pick their three favourite titles of 2019Shortlisted for novel of the year at the British Book awards for Still MeI often find it hard to remember what I’ve read, but Three Women by Lisa Taddeo (Bloomsbury, £16.99) scorched its way into my consciousness. A journalistic deep e into the desires and love lives of three women over eight years, it turns on its head much of what you think about how we learn to love.Kate Weinberg’s debut, The Truants (Bloomsbury, £8.99), took eight years to write, and it shows in the multilayered characters and plot. It contains an image, a hearse in a wood, that stayed with me. If you’ve ever wanted to disappear from your own life, this book will speak to you. You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, £16.99) is another debut, but you’d never know it from the lean, beautiful prose. I was afraid this novel about violence through generations in South Africa would be too dark, but it pulls you in, breaks your heart and then ultimately repairs it.Joint winner of the Booker prize for Girl, Woman, OtherTaking Up Space: The Black Girl’s Manifesto for Change (Merky Books, £12.99) by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi is a groundbreaking and essential book about how it feels to be a young black woman studying in Britain’s white academic institutions. Zawe Ashton’s entertaining, fictionalised account of her life as an actor in Character Breakdown (Vintage, £16.99) is funny, revealing, shocking and inventively structured with conversations presented in script form. Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss (Granta, £8.99) is a slim novel about an iron age-obsessed man who takes his wife and daughter on a re-enaction holiday. It begins weirdly, ends badly and I loved it.Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud and the Last Trial of Harper LeeI visited New Orleans for the first time on my book tour and was so grateful to have Sarah Broom’s The Yellow House (Little, Brown, £14.99) with me for the journey. It’s such a beautiful memoir, and it gives you a rich and complex portrait of the city. Her book, which will be published in the UK next year, has something in common with another nonfiction book I loved this year: Patrick Radden Keefe’s Say Nothing (HarperCollins, £9.99), which also uses one family’s story to tell a broader history – in this case, of the Troubles and all the disappeared. One of Keefe’s gifts is dramatising the inidual decisions that collectively shape global history. I admired that same gift in Miriam Toews’s extraordinary Women Talking (Faber, £8.99), which is a fictional treatment of a horrific series of sexual crimes in a remote religious community. The novel is an understated but powerful look at how everyday people make sense of evil and violence – a truly beautiful, challenging portrait of moral discernment.Shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize for The PorpoiseFriday Black, a collection of short stories by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah (Quercus, £8.99), has the thrilling strangeness of George Saunders but driven by a deep and justified anger about the racism and violence that constitute the bedrock of American society. That makes it sound worthy. It isn’t. It’s a rollercoaster ride. Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, £13.99) is usually described as “eight sentences of 1,000 pages”, which conjures an image of a forbidding avant garde doorstop in the manner of Thomas Bernhard. On the contrary, it is very funny, very readable and one of those novels that expand the possibilities of what a novel can be and do. Chris Ware is one of the great writers of our generation whose graphic novels make most novels (both the graphic and the regular kind) seem thin and simplistic. I spent 20 minutes reading the cover of Rusty Brown (Cape, £25). Buy it. Buy all his work. Make your life larger.Winner of the Rathbones Folio prize for The PerseveranceChoosing three books from such a great year, particularly for poetry collections, is hard but there are three politically and lyrically compelling books that I think will remain relevant in the years ahead. The first is Surge by Jay Bernard (Chatto \u0026amp Windus, £10). Partly influenced by dub poets such as Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jean “Binta” Breeze, it is a book for the air and the page, speculating on the complicated history of the New Cross fire and Grenfell.The next is Deaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky (Faber, £10.99), a book for our times and all times. A high lyric cautionary tale of fascism, which is part poetry, part fable, part play. Finally, After the Formalities by Anthony Anaxagorou (Penned in the Margins, £9.99), which speculates on race, family and immigration.Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for The Lives of Lucian Freud: Youth 1922-1968William Dalrymple’s stupendous The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, £30) propels into focus the story of the East India Company’s takeover of Mughal India, an exercise of opportunism, violence, shamelessness and, at times, heroic greed. More immediate is Edna O’Brien’s Girl (Faber, £16.99), an unflinching parable: Heart of Darkness revisited with Boko Haram horrors recounted as incipient legend. For me, Michael Bird’s Artists’ Letters (White Lion Publishing, £20) has proved ideal dipping. Letters reproduced, transcribed and annotated yield rare insights: Leonardo (“I will assemble catapults”) with (Edward) Lear’s spelling (“fewcher thyme”) and Mondrian’s sore tooth.Winner of the Goldsmiths prize for Ducks, NewburyportThree Muslim women have surreal adventures in Leila Aboulela’s latest novel, Bird Summons (W\u0026ampN, £16.99), her wildest yet, full of her own take on myth, religion and womanhood. Aboulela, based in Aberdeen, deserves as big a following here as she has in Africa. Or bigger. Not strictly new, perhaps, but still terrific: Faber \u0026amp Faber has republished five Thomas Bernhard novels, shamefully out of print in the UK for 20 years. If you haven’t read Bernhard, you will not know of the most radical advance in fiction since Joyce. Bernhard’s influence is pervasive and his style riskily contagious. My advice: e in. As for my third choice, am I allowed to choose a book I guest edited this year? It is the fourth and final volume of The Evergreen, a beautifully designed anthology of poetry and prose published by the Word Bank (£15), an indie based in Edinburgh’s Old Town. The latest issue, dedicated to the “future”, is devoted solely to writing by women and is international in flavour. Suzy Romer discusses the vital role of grandmothers in Spain, Kylie Grant revels in Glasgow’s litter and, in Monica Datta’s astounding Zus!, three young Dutch sisters decide to rustle up a canal system for the US.Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for fiction for CrudoBeing increasingly future-averse, I was gripped by the title of I’ve Seen the Future and I’m Not Going by Peter McGough before I tracked down a copy (it’s only published in the US), but this memoir is truly fascinating a rags-to-riches rollercoaster about the 1980s art boom in downtown New York. McGough wanted to escape the ugliness of the 20th century by retreating to the past meanwhile, in Mother Ship (Vintage, £14.99), novelist Francesca Segal celebrates the technological innovations that kept her twins, born 10 weeks prematurely, alive. It’s a song of praise to the beleaguered, indomitable NHS, with writing at such a pitch that it lingered with me all year. Speaking of enviable phrase-making, I was also smitten by music critic par excellence Ian Penman’s It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track (Fitzcarraldo, £12.99), a collection of dazzling, singular essays on Prince, James Brown, Sinatra, Elvis that gets to the heart of why music exerts such a strange power in our lives.Winner of the Costa children’s book award for The Skylarks’ WarFor me, 2019 has been a year of fantasy and folk tales, both new and retold, in every age group. For children, Lampie and the Children of the Sea (Pushkin Press, £12.99) by Annet Schaap stood out. Lampie, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper, is a girl of great and grumpy courage, with a salty way with words. One day she forgets to buy matches and the lighthouse lantern doesn’t shine. So begins a dark-and-stormy-night of a fairytale that I absolutely loved.For adults, my choice is poetry: The Women Left Behind (Dempsey \u0026amp Windle, £10) by Imogen Russell Williams. Rapunzel’s witch Blodeuwedd, who was shaped from flowers and Romeo’s Rosaline, among many others – English literature forgot them, closed the door and turned away. Now at last we have their voices: wry, lamenting, vengeful, witty, bright, magnificent. Last, a book for everyone: Deeplight (Pan Macmillan, £9.99) by Frances Hardinge. A stunning new ocean mythology of friendship and lost gods, it’s complex, engrossing and gorgeously written, and kept me reading until past 3am but was worth it, over and over.Winner of the European Union prize for literature for All Among the BarleyI was dazzled by Sandra Newman’s The Heavens (Granta, £12.99), which had a time-travel premise (and a noteworthy cameo) that really shouldn’t have worked but absolutely did. How she pulled it off is anyone’s guess, but it left me hugely envious of her confidence and skill. Into a stagnating UK marketplace for memoirs about place came Jessica J Lee’s beautiful Two Trees Make a Forest: On Memory, Migration and Taiwan (Little, Brown, £16.99). Lee is editor of the Willowherb Review, publishing nature writing by writers of colour, including Nina Mingya Powles, winner of the inaugural Nan Shepherd prize. Lisa Taddeo’s Three Women (Bloomsbury, £16.99) es deep into the erotic lives of three women, using source material collected over hundreds of hours of interviews. The resulting account of the awakening, distortion and expression of desire in three very different lives is insightful, devastating and utterly unforgettable.Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for biography with In Extremis: The Life of War Correspondent Marie ColvinIt’s been a year of disinformation, but Peter Pomerantsev has given us a guide in This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality (Faber, £14.99). By dissecting the techniques governments use to create myths and sow confusion, he shows how the freedom of expression his parents sought when they fled the Soviet Union is now used to justify twisting the truth. No such tricks in Our Women on the Ground: Essays By Arab Women Reporting from the Middle East, edited by Zahra Hankir (Harvill Secker, £14.99), which showcases journalism at its bravest. Determination, grit and humour shine through the writing of reporters who frequently face opposition from their own families. Maybe fiction is the best respite from strife and the ever more difficult daily task of telling facts from falsehoods. Mark Haddon’s The Porpoise (Chatto and Windus, £18.99) reworks legend with the compelling force of a thriller. Here, myth is not a distraction, but the key to a deeper truth.Winner of the Branford Boase award for I Am ThunderTwas the Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay (Picador, £9.99) is a fun-size follow-up to the wildly popular This Is Going to Hurt. More stories from the frontline of the NHS that will hit you in the feels and also have you ho-ho-hoing over the festive season. Patrice Lawrence’s Rose, Interrupted (Hachette, £7.99) is a marvellous novel that explores what life is like for a pair of siblings after they are excommunicated from a strict religious sect. Rose seeks freedom, while her brother Rudder seeks redemption. Rounding out my top three is Fearscape: Vol 1 by Ryan O’Sullivan (Vault Comics, £15.99) – a comically dark and witty graphic novel with a narrator who is unreliable, delusional and downright despicable. Once a generation the Muse travels to Earth to take our greatest storyteller back with her to battle fear-creatures. But then she mistakes Henry, a shameless plagiarist, for the best and all hell breaks loose.Shortlisted for the Carnegie medal for Things a Bright Girl Can DoMy eldest started school in September, so education has been very much on my mind. I devoured Kate Clanchy’s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me (Picador, £16.99) therefore. Covering everything from uniform to off-rolling, this is an incredibly readable memoir of 30 years as an English teacher and poet. I also enjoyed Emma Darwin’s This Is Not a Book About Charles Darwin (Holland House, £14.99), an exploration of her failure to write a novel about her famous ancestor and his illustrious family. Finding the spaces in real history to tell a fictional story is a problem I am very familiar with. Recommended. Finally, I’ve never read a Hilary McKay novel I didn’t love, and The Time of Green Magic (Macmillan, £12.99) was no exception. This story of blended families and a house where books come to life would make a perfect Christmas present for any bookish nine- to 12-year-old.Winner of the Costa book of the year award for The Cut Out GirlOver the last few years I have become fascinated by so-called autofiction: books that read like novels (with dialogue, metaphors and precise descriptions) but which are also, at some level, memoirs or autobiographies. Rachel Cusk is a master of the genre and her collection of sharp, provocative essays, Coventry (Faber, £14.99), the follow-up to her Outline trilogy, had me transfixed. I also loved Will by the Flemish author Jeroen Olyslaegers (Pushkin, £14.99), which tells the story of Antwerp under Nazi occupation. The narrator, a policeman who both resists and collaborates in the Holocaust, is a brilliant, morally complex creation. Will is now out in a fine translation and is a compelling read. Finally, Greta Thunberg’s collection of speeches, No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference (Penguin, £2.99), is simple and truthful. She inspired me to join the Extinction Rebellion protests earlier this year.Winner of the Carnegie medal for The Poet XFor Black Girls Like Me by Mariama J Lockington (Farrar, Straus \u0026amp Giroux Inc, £13.99) is a story about a transracial adoptee that had me tearing up, gasping and rooting for the main character, Makeda. It stretched my imagination about the kinds of tough topics a young person can handle reading about. I am so thankful for this honest, gorgeous book. Natasha Diaz’s novel Color Me In (Penguin Random House, £13.99), about a black Jewish poet in Harlem undergoing her bat mitzvah, is such a good book focused on faith, race, rites of passage and the way that young people have to learn not only to stand up for themselves, but also for their communities, especially when they belong to communities that wield power over others. Jacqueline Woodson’s latest novel, Red at the Bone (W\u0026ampN, £14.99), is a beast of a book a masterclass on pace, characterisation and how a writer can be flexible. You’ll find yourself rooting for every character, and hurting for them as well.Shortlisted for the Booker prize for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange WorldOne of my favourite books this year has been Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (Profile, £10.99). It is a stunning research on “information civilisation”, concentration of power and the sinister exploitation of our data at the expense of our freedom, which are no doubt some of the most pressing issues of our times. But more than that, this is a fascinating and wise and honest exploration of what it means to be human in the digital age and why we need to fight back. Technology is way too important to leave it to tech companies, which are clearly becoming tech monopolies. We all need to become part of this important discussion, and for that to happen, we need to ask the right questions. This book is a brilliant way to do that.I loved Helon Habila’s Travelers (Penguin, £12.99). Such a wonderful gem. The book is composed of several stories of people from completely different backgrounds – students, academics, outcasts these are heartbreaking but equally life-affirming tales that might seem separate at first, but then beautifully connect and intertwine in the end, leaving us longing for more. Where is home, where does exile start or does it ever end?I would also wholeheartedly recommend Lemn Sissay’s My Name Is Why (Canongate, £16.99). This powerful and unflinchingly honest memoir has so much to say about the failures of our system and the silences of our society – being black, being in foster care, the struggle for identity, belonging, equality and dignity... A must-read book for anyone who refuses to be “defined by darkness” and injustice.Winner of the Betty Trask award for The Litten PathElizabeth Hardwick’s shimmering melancholia Sleepless Nights was given a crisp reissue in 2019 (Faber, £8.99), 40 years after it was first published, and it’s my book of the year. It’s a dream slideshow, part memoir, part missive, part fiction, a work of lasting beauty that guides you through the mysteries, and tragedies of people the narrator has known and loved: the literary equivalent of polished onyx. This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill (Profile Books, £7.99) tells the story of an influential publisher brought down in a sexual misconduct scandal. It’s a stunningly written, arch look at transgression and our need to feel understood and confided in, and in an age of calling out groping men who think they can hide behind their money, it’s of the moment too. Nobber by Oisin Fagan (John Murray, £12.99) is the book about medieval Ireland I never knew I wanted. Plague-ridden, trippy and violent, it’s uniquely told and full of startling images.Winner of the South Bank Sky Arts award and shortlisted for the Orwell prize, the Women’s prize for fiction and the Rathbones Folio prize for Ordinary PeopleHair is no small subject for the African diaspora, indeed for the history of colonialism and imperialism, which pretty much includes all of us, so I’ve been pleasantly engrossed this autumn in Emma Dabiri’s excellent nonfiction debut Don’t Touch My Hair (Allen Lane, £16.99). Part memoir, part spiky, thoroughly researched sociopolitical analysis, it delves deep into the painful realities and history of follicular racism while offering useful maintenance tips in the process. Of the poetry I’ve been reading this year, Anthony Anaxagorou’s second collection, After the Formalities (Penned in the Margins, £9.99), stands out for its sharp and beguiling, imaginative scope and the endlessly surprising electricity of its language: “I can fit my childhood into a fist” “there’s a kind of shaking the living perform”. And speaking of imaginative scope, there are few writers who possess quite the boundless daring of Irenosen Okojie, whose second collection of short stories, Nudibranch (Little, Brown, £14.99), is dazzling, a feast for the senses, as well as a lesson in both creative and existential bravery.Winner of the Costa first novel award for The Seven Deaths of Evelyn HardcastleLet’s start with The Hug by Eoin McLaughlin and Polly Dunbar (Faber, £6.99), because it’s utterly lovely. It’s a children’s book I read to my young daughter, and it makes her face light up every time she hears it. Reading to give somebody else pleasure isn’t a thing I’ve done before, but it’s surprisingly wonderful. The Porpoise by Mark Haddon (Chatto \u0026amp Windus, £18.99) is the book I’ve recommended the most this year, because it’s the one I had the most fun with. It kept shifting as I read it, changing from action to romance to science-fiction. It’s dizzying. And then there’s A History of the Bible: The Book and Its Faiths by John Barton (Allen Lane, £25). I was brought up Roman Catholic and I’m fascinatedannoyed by the way religion still entangles itself in my thought processes, long past the point I stopped believing in any of it. This book has helped unpick some of my mental knots.Shortlisted for the Booker prize for An Orchestra of MinoritiesLucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, £13.99) stretches the imagination and brings to the universe it seeks to recreate such intensity of purpose and flamboyance that one would be hard-pressed to think of any other word other than “original” to describe it.I very much admired Yiyun Li’s Where Reasons End (Hamish Hamilton, £12.99), a highly unusual novel in which a writer confronts one of life’s deepest sorrows in losing her child. It is a conceptual novel that challenges the form, but the exchanges between the mother and son are funny, touching and profoundly moving.Perhaps one of the most underrated novels of the year is Novuyo Rosa Tshuma’s House of Stone (Atlantic, £8.99), an expansive tale that celebrates a nation through a central character. Were it written about any western country, this novel would have been much talked about, but we are talking Zimbabwe here. It is an ambitious and daring novel from a promising writer.Winner of the Wellcome book prize for Murmur. Also shortlisted for the James Tait Black memorial prize for fictionThe Library of Ice (Scribner, £9.99), Nancy Campbell’s essay on art, science and life in the Arctic, has the direct seriousness of the early Pelican nonfiction list. It’s wittily arranged, too: one section segues from Bill Jacklin’s Rink mural at Washington airport to Noel Streatfeild’s White Boots, and thence to Torvill and Dean’s 1980s figure-skating routines. With a similar associative light touch, Ian Sansom’s September 1, 1939 (4th Estate, £16.99) invokes Vladimir Nabokov and Ed Sheeran to illuminate WH Auden’s famous poem. The book is also a homage to Auden’s aphoristic prose, and such identification with another has its own point to make: an artistic persona, necessarily half borrowed, can take you so far, but the work itself must stay truthful. These distinctions are caught, beautifully and unexpectedly, in novelist Paul Bailey’s first collection of poems, Inheritance (CB Editions, £8.99), about age and self-consciousness, in which the shedding of one literary skin reveals another.Winner of the Desmond Elliott prize for Golden ChildHere are three recent books that, once opened, I couldn’t put down. I came across the essay collection Constellations by Sinéad Gleeson (Picador, £16.99) in the bookshop of the British Library: I’d put aside the day for my own work and ended up standing by the display table, getting in everyone’s way, turning page after page, quite unable to tear myself away. Self-Portrait, Celia Paul’s memoir (Jonathan Cape, £20), I read on my Kindle, until two in the morning when I should have been asleep it was the photograph of the artist in a bare room that drew me in – how I wished my life afforded me that bare room. Finally, Lemn Sissay’s memoir, My Name Is Why (Canongate, £16.99), which I read in one compulsive sitting: a book that reminds me, as it should remind us all, that the state of childhood is a state of profound vulnerability.Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio prize for There ThereThe three books I enjoyed reading the most in 2019 are Ocean Vuong’s On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (Vintage, £12.99), Valeria Luiselli’s Lost Children Archive (4th Estate, £16.99), and Samanta Schweblin’s Mouthful of Birds (Oneworld, £12.99). Ocean’s novel because it is just so very full of beauty and power. Also, grace. Valeria’s novel because it is exquisitely smart, funny and thrilling, and Samanta’s stories because they are so new and strange and good. Her collection makes me want to use the trite and overused descriptor Kafkaesque, but I won’t.Winner of the Baillie-Gifford prize for The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed By Jack the RipperTop of my list is Lisa Taddeo’s Three Women (Bloomsbury, £16.99). The best stories are often true ones an intimate examination of three women’s sex lives is a seductive subject in itself, but the sumptuous and visceral writing made this book an enthralling read. Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments (Chatto \u0026amp Windus, £20) provided the perfect escapist pleasure, cleverly knitting together strands from both her novel The Handmaid’s Tale and its television adaptation. Observing Atwood work with two storytelling mediums has been an education. Lara Maiklem’s Mudlarking (Bloomsbury, £18.99) is testimony to the beauty of micro-history and how small objects and unknown figures are capable of telling large, panoramic stories. In this case, the author has constructed a history of London from artefacts found on the Thames foreshore.Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Maoism: A Global HistoryI’ve chosen three books that make us see the world in new, connected ways. William Dalrymple’s The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, £30) tells the extraordinary story of how the East India Company became a ruthless colonising power that throughout the 18th century effectively ended Mughal control of India. The book is a powerful, timely reminder of the dangerous power of corporate excess. Toby Green’s A Fistful of Shells (Allen Lane, £30) uses a global archive – in Africa, the Americas and Europe – to explore the complex, flourishing and connected economy of West Africa existing long before a European capitalist system established itself on the continent. Extraordinarily written and researched, the book paints a huge, complex canvas, filled with inidual detail. Azadeh Moaveni’s Guest House for Young Widows (Scribe UK, £16.99) brilliantly illuminates the transnational lives and choices of women who joined Isis. Resting on interviews across Europe and the Middle East, it subtly, carefully explains how such women took the path they did.Winner of the Gordon Burn award for For the Good TimesThe most incredible book I read this year was Paul Kingsnorth’s Savage Gods (Little Toller, £14), a dramatic self-accounting that explodes “nature writing” to strain at the limits of language itself. Kingsnorth charts the breakdown of his faith in words, in nature as an uncomplicated restorative, in the idea of “progress”, while fearlessly tracking his conclusions to their very ends. This is a writer – and a writer that burns – attempting to cure himself of writing, on the page, and it leads to some profound, and just as often jaw-dropping, insights. Kingsnorth’s two novels, The Wake and Beast, were masterpieces. But it’s hard to imagine where he might go after this. Nowhere, perhaps.My favourite novel was Bindlestiff by Wayne Holloway (Influx Press, £9.99), a riotous, high-energy vision of future America and contemporary Hollywood that is dizzying in its imagination as it jumps between prose and film script and tears through modes and genres with a high modernist glee and a rock’n’roll swagger. My favourite short story collection was Wendy Erskine’s Sweet Home (Picador, £12.99). The prose is amazing, the dialogue perfect Erskine is attuned to the momentous surrealism of everyday life in contemporary Belfast, where different rules continue to apply.Winner of the Caine prize for African fiction for SkinnedSabrina \u0026amp Corina by Kali Fajardo-Anstine (Random House USA Inc, £22.50) is a gem of a short story collection that evinces enviable skill and a broad range as Fajardo-Anstine unfolds both sweeping and intimate stories of indigenous and Latin experiences in the American west. House of Stone by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma (Atlantic, £8.99) is a literary, historical page-turner - a tall order that Tshuma achieves in this exceptional debut. There are several gasp-out-loud twists and a narrator who charms and offends in equal measure, even as the novel thoughtfully examines a brutal period in Zimbabwe’s history. Tressie McMillan Cottom is a genius. In Thick and Other Essays (New Press, £13.99) she articulates America’s social dimensions in regards to race, gender, education and class with a studied consideration born of intensive research, shored with the digestibility of personal experience. I have long been a fan of her work and Thick delivered beyond my already high expectations.Winner of Books Are My Bag readers’ choice award and Royal Society insight investment science book prize for Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for MenThis has been a bumper year for dog-related memoirs and while obviously I loved them all (all dog memoirs are good girls), Lost Dog: A Love Story by Kate Spicer (Ebury, £16.99) was my favourite. Funny, touching and absolutely right about the redeeming power of the pooch. A doggy page-turner: I read it straight through in two days.Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (Wildfire, £18.99) was a minute, unsparing examination of the breakdown of a marriage. I kept having to stop to take pictures of passages (some of which ran on for pages) to send to friends because it was just too accurate. Sad, mad and funny. Also features a bonus dog. The bombshell revelation of Becoming Beauvoir (Bloomsbury, £20), Kate Kirkpatrick’s excellent biography of Simone de Beauvoir, is the bowdlerisation of The Second Sex by the man who translated this seminal feminist text into English. HM Parshley cut De Beauvoir’s analysis of housework and references to women’s anger, along with 78 women’s names from the women’s history section. He kept in references to men’s feelings, though.Winner of the British book awards fiction debut award for LullabyMuhammad Abdelnabi is one of the most brilliant Egyptian authors today and rightly received the Arab literature prize for La chambre de l’araignée (In the Spider’s Room) (the American University in Cairo Press, £9.99). He is the first Arab writer to explore homosexuality so sincerely and extensively. His novel was inspired by a very famous case in Egypt: in 2001, 52 men were arrested in a nightclub because of their sexuality. The author adopts the point of view of one of them so the reader becomes effectively embedded in the gay community of a country where homosexuals are systematically persecuted. This beautifully written and poetic book moved me to tears it is an ode to freedom and a real act of bravery. The Sport of Kings by CE Morgan (4th Estate, £16.99) was translated into French in January 2019. It tells the story of a redemption and is a declaration of love to horses. I was really impressed by the author’s style and lyricism and the way she described violence inside a family and between social classes.The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (Bloomsbury Circus, £16.99) is probably one of the most powerful books I’ve read these past few years on immigration and the US. I experienced the same pleasure reading it as I got from the great classical novels I read as a teenager. Its variety of characters and scenes makes it hard to categorise. The former seem so real, so alive, you can almost touch them Lalami has a wonderful, very tender way of exploring their souls.Winner of the Women’s prize for fiction for An American MarriageOne of my favourite novels of 2019 is You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, £16.99), which is almost like two novels at once. The first half is an unflinching look at the second Boer war at the turn of the 20th century. Be warned this is a demanding read. Any war, even one known as “the last gentlemen’s war”, is marked by unchecked brutality and Barr never lets us lose sight of the toll of the inhumanity inflicted on the Boers and that they inflict on the indigenous people of South Africa. Then, with grace and artistry, he weaves this story with that of a modern-day gay conversion camp that bears far too close a resemblance to the conditions of war. There is pain on these pages and poetry too. I left this book bruised yet somehow better for it.I also loved Patsy by Nicole Dennis-Benn (Oneworld, £16.99). It’s a story about mothers, daughters and the high price immigrants pay to change their lives. My final pick is a gorgeous collection of poetry by Jericho Brown. The Tradition (Pan Macmillan, £10.99) spins poetic gold from the exquisite pain and pleasure of being black in America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e884d260d36d773b12f40aaf486109c0b97d9446/54_98_6030_3618/master/6030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87707c329f4352ab8b38d906974d4caa","title":"paul merton alan furst bella mackie in brief book reviews by alexander larman","story":"Paul MertonHead of Zeus, £25, 633pp As you might expect from as singular a comic talent as Paul Merton, this compilation of his favourite funny stories offers material both hilarious and unusual. Alongside Wodehouse and Saki are contemporary writers including Margaret Atwood and Ali Smith, the latter’s bizarre tale of an unusual encounter on a shopping trip being one of the best things here. It’s also hard to beat Kevin Barry’s uproarious Beer Trip to Llandudno – a finely wrought tale of alcohol-fuelled male bonding.One of the characters in Alan Furst’s new novel, a publisher, remarks that his author is “a master of the form” who has produced “an entertainment, but a smart one, written with a sharp eye and a big heart”. This is a fitting description for this second world war thriller, a gripping story of a novelist handed a top-secret blueprint by a dying man and tasked with getting it into the hands of the French resistance while hounded by the Gestapo. Furst’s writing sometimes verges on the perfunctory – a possible consequence of his frantic plotting – but the twists and intrigue keep coming.Bella Mackie’s first book, subtitled How Running Saved My Life, is an elegant, uplifting means of discussing her battles with anxiety and depression. Mackie doesn’t sugarcoat the difficulties that led her to start running, or the problems she has faced as a runner – thankfully, this is not a book in which the writer becomes an ultra-marathon winner. In an accessible fashion, Mackie makes the idea of pulling on trainers and pounding the pavements life-affirming. • To order Funny Ha Ha, Under Occupation or Jog On go to bookshop.

It used to repel me: my father, a cat pawing through the trash. There was an obsessive, almost mechanical quality to his movements that frightened me.” She didn’t associate Hannan, who served in the Israeli air force for almost 50 years, with the Holocaust.Her father had told her no tales of murderous concentration camps or welcome liberation. Dekel only knew that Hannan, along with his sister Rivka and their cousin Naomi, had been part of a wartime mission by the World Zionist Organisation to rescue Polish Jewish children. They had arrived in what was then British-controlled Palestine in 1943 via Iran and were known as the Tehran Children because Iran had provided their final staging post.It wasn’t until 2007, when Dekel, by then an academic in New York, met the writer Salar Abdoh that she learned more. Abdoh knew the story of the Tehran Children from an Iranian perspective and regarded his country’s role in their rescue as evidence that his culture was not intrinsically antisemitic. Dekel asked him to collaborate on retracing her father’s journey. Working together seemed to her to be a way to “overcome vexed oppositions like JewChristianMuslim, a way of sidestepping the deep and deepening impasse between Israel and the Islamic Republic”.Based on their almost eight years of research into Dekel’s father’s convoluted 13,000-mile journey, the book draws on archives in Russia, Poland and Central Asia that have only been opened up in the last decade, as well as records kept in Israel, the UK and by the Red Cross. The result is a book that is both a highly personal, journalistic memoir and a valuable addition to Holocaust history. Dekel traces her family’s journey as they fled east from their home town in Poland, just ahead of the German invasion in 1939.When the Soviet authorities forced Polish citizens in 1940 to work in the gulags in Siberia, the family nearly starved before being shipped on to Uzbekistan. They were part of a wave of famished Polish refugees in Tashkent and Samarkand, where conditions soon deteriorated with outbreaks of typhus and other diseases. No one knows how many thousands died at each staging post, but when Hannan’s parents were told in late 1942 that there was a chance for unaccompanied minors to go to Iran (then under British rule), they seized it. Trains crammed with soldiers under the command of the Polish government in exile were being sent to strengthen the British armies in the Middle East. Hannan, his sister and cousin joined 1,000 Jewish children on the journey.But Iran itself proved no easy haven. Up to 33,000 Polish soldiers and 11,000 refugees were now under the purview of the British army. The initial warm welcome from Iran’s Jewish population in August 1942 turned sour when supplies ran low and winter threatened. Local newspapers denounced the new arrivals as “parasites of the allies”. Graffiti on Tehran’s walls read “all of Persia is hungry as it watches the Poles and the British eat its bread”. Fearful of a local uprising, the British shipped the Polish Catholic refugees on to New Zealand, India and Africa some 861 Polish Jewish children, including Dekel’s father, were sent on to British Palestine.No nation comes out with an unblemished record once settled in a kibbutz in 1943, Hannan and his sister pleaded with the British authorities to allow their mother, who had survived, to join them. It wasn’t until 1949 that they were reunited in newly established Israel. Dekel recalls the stigma then attached to the traumatised European Jews she describes them as having a “muted aura of shame and anxiety in the Israel of my youth”. It was easier to be proud of her father. The Tehran Children had been given far higher status because their rescue by the Jewish agency had been a great achievement their arrival in February 1943 had been greeted with cheering crowds and jubilant newsreels.At every stage of her family’s odyssey, Dekel uncovers reports and witness accounts of corruption and mistreatment. Yet her book doesn’t just cast light on an overlooked chapter in the fate of Europe’s Jews in the second world war. It lets us see how challenging it is trying to tell that story fairly. When the records and testimonies uncover overtly antisemitic discrimination by the Polish, Dekel’s formerly helpful Polish archivist becomes defensive. Dekel’s original plan to co-author the book with Abdoh is abandoned as the story becomes more about her father’s journey through Russia and Central Asia than his time in Iran. Tehran Children tackles the difficulties of recounting history from the perspective of today’s fluctuating political orthodoxy.What makes Dekel’s study so valuable is not just its assiduous detailing of one family’s fate during the second world war, but how it also makes us reflect on our current era, with its mass migrations of desperate people fleeing conflict and hardship only to meet inflamed nativism and the desire to shift responsibility for their fate from one country on to the next.• Tehran Children: A Holocaust Refugee Odyssey by Mikhal Dekel is published by WW Norton \u0026amp Co (£19.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b206880fc09f17233685787a1c73950adcf1d574/0_9_594_356/master/594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7b68eec545b07a4799aa4b2c8f9812b","title":"plant based food firm meatless farms hires former lidl boss","story":"Danish executive Jesper Højer joins as chairman amid demand for meat alternativesBritish plant-based food maker Meatless Farm has hired the former head of Lidl to chair its board as it looks to exploit the boom in demand for meat alternatives.Jesper Højer has been appointed to the Leeds-based company, with a brief to help expand the rapidly growing business, after leaving Lidl in April this year.Højer spent two years as the head of the discount supermarket chain’s 10,800 stores in Europe and the US, but resigned saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.His new role will place him near the centre of a boom in products catering for vegan, vegetarian and reduced-meat “flexitarian” diets, amid growing concerns over the environmental and health impacts of the global meat industry. American meat-substitute manufacturers Beyond Meat and Impossible command multibillion-dollar valuations, and the global market for plant-based meat substitutes could reach $140bn (£108bn) over the next decade, according to investment bank analysts at Barclays.The Meatless Farm was only incorporated in 2017, by Morten Toft Bech, a Danish entrepreneur with a background in tech investment. Since starting production in 2018, it has secured distribution deals with Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and the Cooperative. The JD Wetherspoon pub chain sells 200,000 Meatless Farm burgers a month, while Amazon-owned Whole Foods Markets sells its products across the US.Bech said he wanted to make the “European version of Beyond Meat and Impossible”. The hype around Beyond Meat’s stock market flotation has increased investor interest, he added.“We’re the right type of product at the right time,” he said.The company now makes 1,000 tonnes of food each month in a factory near Nottingham. It sells a 400g pack of meat-free mince for £3 and packs of two burgers or six sausages for £2.50 each.Meatless Farms has so far gained about £10m in backing, including investments from vegan venture capital firms Stray Dog Capital and Beyond Impact and Irish investment house Elkstone. Bech said he wanted to target blue-chip investors to raise a further £50m in the second quarter of 2020 to fund expansion, including a new Canadian factory for the north American market.Højer said: “I have been following the market for meat alternatives for some time and The Meatless Farm Co has a great opportunity to be one of the global leaders in this fast-developing food sector.”Meatless Farm has also hired Coca-Cola’s former head of media, Lone Thomsen, as its chief marketing officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08af1aa59e97506fd9cd4ab1afc8af8916f78d5/0_600_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87218b917afd58c03bf991c50641faaa","title":"south western railway commuters facing more misery as strike starts","story":"Latest RMT action runs through most of December in dispute over role of train crewsA month of misery for hundreds of thousands of rail commuters begins on Monday when RMT members of South Western Railway walk out on the first of 27 days of strike action.Hundreds of guards and a small number of drivers will not clock on for work again this Christmas, apart from on election day on 12 December, in a bitter row over the role and responsibilities of onboard train crew. The train firm was among others to be hit by similar strike action last year over the role of guards.Only about half of normal weekday services will run on SWR, the UK’s second biggest train operator with about 600,000 passenger trips a day from Surrey, Hampshire and beyond into London Waterloo, the country’s busiest station.Services will be cut entirely on some routes, with replacement buses in parts, and passengers erted on to other rail operators’ trains. Commuters have been warned to expect extremely overcrowded peak services and even queues to enter stations.Two days of talks at Acas last week ended acrimoniously, with the RMT accusing the train operator of refusing to make concessions to avert the strikes, while SWR said the union was “repeatedly moving the goalposts” and “intent on striking no matter what”.New trains introduced on SWR allow for driver-only or driver-controlled operation. While the train company has pledged to retain a second crew member aboard, the RMT has sought further assurances, including changes to procedures when boarding, that would keep safety-trained guards integral to the operation, even with drivers controlling the doors.The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said last week that SWR’s plans could “reduce the second person on the train to little more than a passenger in the longer term, which would give the company the option of axing them altogether at some point down the line”.Cash urged the company to “grab with both hands” a solution to avoid disrupting passengers.SWR, however, said it had done “everything we can and more to meet the RMT’s outdated demands”, including a safety critical role for guards. But it said the proposals from the union would compromise the improved performance, safety and customer service that the new fleet of trains would deliver.The RMT claimed that SWR could benefit from up to £86m in reduced payments to government because of clauses in its franchise contract over lost revenue from industrial action – effectively giving it no incentive to reach agreement and avoid a strike.SWR refused to comment, saying any such terms were a matter of commercial confidentiality.Both sides say they remain available for negotiations but there appeared little prospect of agreement last week.The long-running dispute over guards and driver-controlled operation of trains first prompted prolonged industrial action at Southern. It has since spread to networks including Northern, Merseyrail and most recently West Midlands.The RMT has started a series of strikes on Saturdays until the end of the year on West Midlands, which includes local West Midlands services and the longer-distance London Northwestern Railway trains. West Midlands, like SWR, has pledged to keep a guard on every passenger train, but failed to assure the union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d72e1ed6c9a6fb84c8f27c975373d82dfc7d08a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c240f823ee9a574307d17aa230439dee","title":"ive shaken off the idea that i should settle down the fortysomethings guide to freedom","story":"Forget what you ‘should’ be doing.

I don’t pretend everything is OK. I say how I’m feeling. Telling the truth is liberating, however difficult it might be sometimes. As a therapist I ask clients how they’re feeling and they’ll tell me they’re fine. Really? It’s something we say out of habit and it does not serve us. “How fine are you really then?” I ask, and then we can open up and start to feel better.‘Getting away for a microholiday as a couple is essential to my marriage’Kate Parker, 42, communications professional, Shropshire‘Don’t give up doing cool things. Even if it means going solo’Jiao Jennings, 40, international business consultant, LondonNow’s the time to come clean and say what you want to do. A girls’ holiday in Ibiza is not me anymore – horrible idea! Why spend precious time doing things you don’t want to do? The key is not to be afraid of doing things by yourself. Recently I went to the Modigliani exhibition at Tate Modern and spent two luxurious hours wandering around looking at the show solo. Another time I spontaneously got up early for an incredible yoga class in the V\u0026ampA courtyard. If a friend wants to come, great, but I don’t want to give up doing cool things, or to feel like I’m dragging someone along with me. It makes friendships simpler and stronger: when we get together we happily pick up where we left off, even if it’s been six months.‘Knowing that I can do something I’m slightly scared of makes me think I can do anything’Caroline Crowther, 40, fundraiser, EssexWhenever I plan a relaxing evening – simple stuff like watching TV with my partner or having a bath – that time gets eaten into by kids, working late or household chores. It’s not surprising that I’ve felt pretty stressed for almost as long as I can remember. Then my best friend gave me trapeze lessons for my 40th birthday, with the idea that if I booked out the time in my diary then I’d treat it with the same respect as I would a board meeting. I always make time for my class. Partly because I feel accountable – the class is booked – but mostly because I love trapeze. I’m terrified of falling flat on my face, but hanging on to the bar and flying through the air is exhilarating. Afterwards I have more energy and I feel inspired. Knowing that I can do something I’m slightly scared of makes me think I can do anything.‘I’ve shaken off the idea that I should settle down and have a proper job’Jo Carnegie, 44, journalist and advice columnist, BedfordshireNot going down the traditional fortysomething path of having a family is liberating because I’m free to find my own way. I don’t have to worry whether I’m making the right or wrong choices – they’re just my choices. For example, for the past five years I’ve been volunteering at a charity in India, Tree of Life for Animals, working out there for a month or two each year. It’s a massive part of who I am now just as important as my life back here. I’ve shaken off the idea that I should stay at home, settle down and have a proper job. I can choose what fulfils me.‘I had no time to pursue my passion, so I turned it into my job’Emily Murray, 41, founder of The Pink House, EdinburghWhat with two kids, a marriage, a mortgage, septuagenarian parents and some semblance of a social life, I realised there’s scarce time to pursue my own passions unless I make it my actual job. So when I went back to work after an extended maternity leave, I founded my interiors business with this in mind. Essentially, my job is to convey my enthusiasm for interiors to other people, so every day I’m dovetailing work and joy. I’m not trying to squeeze in work and play as it all wraps into one. My business model is basically if something grabs me, I grab it back, whether it’s a technicolour wallpaper, bizarre lampshade or a week-long design reccy in a luxurious Alpine ski chalet.Beauty is ageless.

But in September I broke this rule, and went to Cambridge to talk to Clive James about his latest book.The day before, I’d taken a call from his daughter, Claerwen James, the artist and my friend of more than 25 years. Clive was soon to publish a short book about Philip Larkin. He was pleased with it, and wanted to tell people about it. But he was also too ill, by this point, to see a stranger. Would I come? It would mean so much to him. I told her that I would.I want to be clear. It is Claerwen who was, and is, my friend, not Clive. But still, he was a big and beloved figure in my life, and not only because she and I could spend hours at a time talking about our fathers in particular, and men in general. When I first met him, I was 25 and miserably toiling as a trainee in a Fleet Street newsroom. I knew no one, and nothing, and I was very shy, and thanks to these things – and the fact that he was a genius – I was a bit intimidated by him at first. Nevertheless, in those early years, he influenced me in all sorts of small but vital ways. I have a strong memory of an afternoon some time in about 1998. Claerwen and I walked into a room to find Clive listening to Joan Sutherland singing Bellini’s opera Norma. He was in a state that seemed to me to be close to sexual ecstasy: legs apart, head thrown back, a look of pure bliss on his face. I knew nothing of opera then, but as he translated her words for us – he sprang out of his chair to do this – I thought to myself: I’ll have what he’s having, thanks. That recording of Norma was the first opera I ever owned on CD, bought that very week. Clive’s enthusiasm, as bright and as powerful as a Klieg light, could make you want to read, listen to, watch or look at almost anything.He was – this has already been said – very, very clever and very, very funny he had a way of making you see that something could be both ridiculous and magnificent, and ever since I first learned this from him, I’ve always borne it in mind. He had, too, a sybaritic side that I adored. He could squeeze such pleasure from things. I’ve never seen anyone drink a bottle of Jacob’s Creek with so much enjoyment as him it might as well have been Château Lafite in his glass. I thought of him, always, as deeply generous.He noticed you, and what you were up to. Whenever, in later years, he was trying to get me to come to one of his book launches – I didn’t need much persuading – he would send me such sweetly beseeching emails. His “dazzlement ision” needed me, he would insist. A certain kind of flirtation, like a certain kind of teasing, is a form of kindness, and for all that I did not take these messages too seriously (he was like this with everyone), that was how I received them: as kindnesses.What I loved most of all, though, was to see him make Claerwen laugh. It’s my strongly held belief that a man who can make his own daughter – who is almost bound to be, however loving, a sceptic so far as her male parent goes – collapse into laughter is basically doing all right.On that day in September, he made us both laugh a lot. When I arrived, he was sitting in the thin autumn sunshine on the little balcony off his sitting room (a balcony that once overlooked the famous maple tree that was the subject of one of his late poems). He had grown a beard, and that, and his happy wave when I came in, made me think of Robinson Crusoe. I was shocked by the way his cancer had ravaged his face – contrary to reports last week, it wasn’t his leukaemia that killed him, but a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in other words, it was the Australian sunshine he absorbed in his youth that did for him in the end – but his eyes were refulgent, and he was so full of grace, and so intact in every other way. Somehow, he was the very essence of himself. It was heart-stirring to see, an almost numinous thing, though I knew he didn’t believe in God.Larkin had always been a bond between him, Claerwen and me: we just think he is the Man. The book Somewhere Becoming Rain is a gathering together of everything Clive ever wrote about Larkin. It was Claerwen’s idea she designed the cover, and it’s dedicated to her. On that day, we talked about Larkin first.When he grew tired, we gossiped a bit. He and Claerwen were looking for a new box set to devour, and I recommended Succession. (She told me later how much he liked it.) Finally, we looked at a draft of The Fire of Joy, which will be published next year and is a collection of “roughly 80 poems to get by heart and say aloud”.As I turned its pages, I was struck, all over again, by the astonishing range of his reading. Here were Auden and Keats and Wyatt. But here, too, were poets I’d never heard of. Clive read (in multiple languages) like his life depended on it – and perhaps it did, in a way. Words, to him, were as necessary as water. What follows is part of our conversation. At the time, I knew it would be our last, and yet it was so easy. Clive loved to have an audience – and I loved to listen.Can you remember when you read Larkin for the first time?The answer is yes, yes, yes – and yes. It was the cold winter of 1964. My landlord, a young publisher, said that if I really wanted to catch up with modern English poetry, I should read Philip Larkin. So I read The Less Deceived. Although I like to think that I brought a certain receptivity to the party – I was his ideal reader – I was knocked out straight away.How did he make you feel?First of all, the spoken rhythms were so wonderful. I still think he’s the tops in that way. Second, I knew exactly what the poems meant – and that’s what staggers me, still, about him. There can’t be many poets in any language who communicate with their readers on such a basic level. I went quietly mad for him.By the time his last collection, High Windows, was published in 1974, you were in a position to review it. Was that a big deal for you?Yes. The feeling was: this is history, and it’s happening to me. It’s an unbeatable thing, writing about art. It’s heaven.Yes. I could talk about this for ever, which is a bad sign. There were faculty members here in Cambridge saying we shouldn’t read Larkin. What the fuck does that mean? Who else are you recommending we don’t read?I think there are various big and obvious reasons why some people wanted to diminish him. One would be his enviable reputation. Another would be the fact that he just didn’t cooperate. He stayed in Hull. London literary life wasn’t for him.That life was for you, though, wasn’t it?Ha, yes. I enjoyed it, the whole business. The argy-bargy. The tangle. My rivals, even.Yes, and that’s the loudest thing to say. Though it could have been a near-run thing, they won through.If we were on a desert island, what Larkin poems would we want?First of all, I’d be trying to attract your attention. So it would be the romantic ones. But … we’re on a desert island! I’d already have your attention. No, there are so many. I’d have The Whitsun Weddings, Aubade, Church Going, Mr Bleaney, Dockery and Son, To the Sea, An Arundel Tomb, At Grass – it’s fabulous – Next, Please. His range of evocation is unmatched since metaphysical times, and he has – people forget this – such a feeling for the countryside, puttering along in his very unpowerful car.What about death? Larkin is preoccupied with it, and I wonder what you feel about that, now.But Larkin was different. He knew it would end in silence, and he was afraid of the silence. He didn’t like the idea of not being here. I’m not like that – and my death might come as a relief to quite a few people. I’d rather like it not to hurt, that’s all.Will you write another book?Suppose I did another volume of memoirs…Would you like to?Yes, but I don’t think I have the energy. I’ve been hit in the face by a cricket bat at 1,000 miles an hour. I think the last round-up is here. But that’s OK. It would be bad manners to complain. I’ve had a lucky life, and I’m grateful for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a654ad8d6dfae28fbdfa86bfe9361840da5a2d3/0_219_2398_1440/master/2398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f14a8a72cd078ea21fc367b2049f4e","title":"get the lowdown on toronto ontarios cosmopolitan capital","story":"Toronto is always in the mood for a good party. And with its exhilarating blend of cultures, plus a spotlight on film, fashion, sports and arts, there’s always something to celebrate in Canada’s largest cityWalking Toronto’s streets is like stepping into the pages of an atlas. The city’s multicultural mix is everywhere in its colourful neighbourhoods – five Chinatowns, a Greektown, Little Portugal, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Korea Town, plus numerous other enclaves ranging from Ukrainian to Ethiopian. It all adds up to a restaurant scene that takes variety to a new level.Cosmopolitan Toronto also does fine dining superbly well, with menus that raid the Canadian larder for Nova Scotia lobster, Newfoundland crab, Prince Edward Island grass-fed beef and maple syrup from Ontario’s very own Lanark County. Try the inventive dishes that mingle Canadian and international flavours at the ONE restaurant at the Hazelton Hotel in swish Yorkville, or sublime plates with a view at Canoe on the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower in the Financial District. Hot new arrivals on the foodie scene include Aloette, run by chef Patrick Kriss, which champions bistro dishes – from Burgundy snails with Puy lentils, to pulled lamb in couscous. And don’t miss the desserts at Bacchanal pastry chef Cori Osborne produces exquisite treats like Paris-Brest and babas au rhum.Along with fine-dining restaurants, Toronto is fast becoming known for a more simple pleasure: beer. Whole neighbourhoods have been given a new lease of life thanks to the steady rise of microbreweries – just wander down the streets of the Junction in the west of the city to see how the Indie Ale House and Junction Craft Brewing transformed this former down-at-heel neighbourhood. You’ll be spoiled for choice, too, among the laid-back bars of Ossington Avenue and the burgeoning craft breweries on Geary Avenue in Bloordale.Toronto’s cultural life is as rich as its restaurant menus. Come in September to catch glimpses of film stars during the Toronto International Film Festival, one of the largest in the world that’s open to the public. In June, the Luminato Festival celebrates Toronto’s creative spirit with 10 days of music, theatre, dance and visual arts events.There’s a chilled-out, family-friendly atmosphere at the fun Toronto International BuskerFest, which takes over Woodbine Park on the eastern lakeshore in the last few days of August. Photography fans can enjoy the largest photography event in the world during the Scotiabank CONTACT festival in May, when more than 200 exhibitions take place around the city.If your visit doesn’t coincide with any of Toronto’s festivals, however, get your cultural fix at the Royal Ontario Museum, whose exhibits  the globe and go back to prehistoric times. Around the corner is the Gardiner Museum, which showcases artistic ingenuity through the medium of pottery and ceramics. And for the more fashion-focused, the Bata Shoe Museum has a riveting collection of footwear that goes back 4,500 years.If standing on the glass floor near the top of the CN Tower isn’t hair raising enough for you, strap yourself into a harness and take the EdgeWalk around the outside of the highest free-standing structure in the western hemisphere. They call it Toronto’s most extreme attraction, and they’re not exaggerating.Come back down to earth gently next door at Ripley’s Aquarium, which turns into an underwater jazz club on the second Friday of each month. There’s more music in store at Casa Loma, a wondrous Gothic fantasy castle built more than a century ago by a rich financier. Its garden is a magical setting for summertime classical concerts.For an unusual night at the museum, join the dancing at Friday Night Live at the Royal Ontario Museum. While DJs and artists perform, snack at the pop-up food stalls and check out the galleries by night. There’s a similar vibe at the Art Gallery of Ontario’s First Thursdays, with live music and the food-focused Night Market.The city buzzes all year round, thanks to a busy festival calendar that guarantees fun every month. Summer brings some of the city’s biggest outdoor parties, including the Caribbean-inspired Toronto Caribbean Carnival . It’s also the best time to rent a bike and cycle through the enchanting Toronto Islands, which offers great views of the city from tranquil, wooded vantage points and is home to a 200-year-old lighthouse.During the winter months, the nights become long and the bars and restaurants become cosy nooks perfect for date nights. It’s also when you get the chance to join Torontonians on the dozens of open-air ice-skating rinks that pop up all over the city. The most atmospheric is right in front of the twin-towered City Hall and its giant Toronto sign.No matter what time of year you visit, Toronto’s red-carpet events, music scene, cultural ersity, fine dining and “always-on” attitude make the Canadian capital worthy of “world-city” status. There are few places on the planet where cosmopolitan cool has become so accessible.Discover more of Toronto’s longer nights and brighter lights with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c8db27e4e27c99e352b501f7ef8251663830f9/106_164_3471_2083/master/3471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10684779d0995aae435125a38291dab2","title":"scientists theory of climates titanic moment the tip of a mathematical iceberg","story":"Formula for climate emergency shows if ‘reaction time is longer than intervention time left’ then ‘we have lost control’If you’re the captain of the Titanic, approaching a giant iceberg with the potential to sink your ship becomes an emergency only when you realise you might not have enough time to steer a safe course.And so it is, says Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, when it comes to the climate emergency.Knowing how long societies have to react to pull the brake on the Earth’s climate and then how long it will take for the ship to slow down is the difference between a climate emergency and a manageable problem.Rather than being something abstract and open to interpretation, Schellnhuber says the climate emergency is something with clear and calculable risks that you could put into a formula. And so he wrote one.In a comment article in the journal Nature, Schellnhuber and colleagues explained that to understand the climate emergency we needed to quantify the relationship between risk (R) and urgency (U).Borrowing from the insurance industry, the scientists define risk (R) as the probability of something happening (p) multiplied by damage (D).For example, how likely is it that sea levels will rise by a metre and how much damage will that cause.Urgency (U) is the time it takes you to react to an issue (τ) “ided by the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome (T)”, they wrote.Schellnhuber, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, tells  Australia the work on the formula was just the “tip of a mathematical iceberg” in defining the climate emergency.“It can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster, but it applies to many severe risks where you can calculate the do-nothingbusiness-as-usual probability of a highly damaging event,” he says. “Yet there are options to avoid the disaster.“In other words, this a control problem.” There is a time lag between the rapid cuts to greenhouse gases and the climate system reacting. Knowing if you have enough time tells you if you’re in an emergency or not.Schellnhuber used “standard risk analysis and control theory” to come up with the formula, and he was already putting numbers to it.As the scientists write in Nature, if the “reaction time is longer than the intervention time left” then “we have lost control”.Schellnhuber says: “Beyond that critical point, only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).”Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries announced “climate emergency” as the word of the year, defining it as “a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it”.One website tracking climate emergency declarations says 1,195 jurisdictions in 25 countries, representing 454 million people, have already voted on the emergency.This week the European parliament joined them, as did Ballina shire council in northern New South Wales, the 76th local government authority in Australia to make the declaration.Prof Will Steffen, of the Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and a co-author of the article, says: “Emergency can mean many things to many people. But there are some hard numbers behind why so many people are saying we are in a climate emergency.“This formula sharpens our thinking. So we have 30 years to decarbonise and to stabilise our pressure on the climate system.”In the Nature article, the scientists highlight nine “tipping points” that, if crossed, become almost impossible to stop. At least five are already “active”.Some of them, like melting permafrost or forest degradation, can start to add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, making the job of keeping global temperatures down even harder.“But the time we have left to intervene to stabilise coral reefs, for example, is a lot less than 30 years.“To err on the side of danger is a stupid thing to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/154b059781a02efb0cd881bfabfb9e8c16839d78/0_226_4659_2795/master/4659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e4a59e05115a269cb547c2926ac4bb3","title":"cosmic crisp apple debut us stores","story":"Fruit, a cross between Enterprise and Honeycrisp apple varieties, was bred to feature ‘naturally higher levels of acidity and sugar’The Cosmic Crisp – a new super-sweet variety of apple that can reportedly last longer than a year in the refrigerator – is expected to hit grocery stores in the US this week.The Cosmic Crisp’s release comes after two decades of development and some three years of planting apple trees. Washington state farmers have exclusive growing rights for one decade, according to local media outlet KIMA.The apple, developed by Washington State University’s fruit tree breeding program and first cultivated in 1997, purports to have a “remarkably firm and crisp texture” and be “surprisingly sweet, making it an excellent eating apple”, according to its website. The launch has reportedly cost $10m.The fruit, a cross between the Enterprise and Honeycrisp apple varieties, was bred to feature “naturally higher levels of acidity and sugar,” so much so that one can use less sugar while baking, researchers claim.They also say that it’s “naturally slow to brown when cut and maintains its texture and flavor in storage for more than a year”.Its name stems from the tiny bright dots on the apple’s otherwise darker red skin. Tasters said the flecks reminded them of “outer space and the cosmos,” Cosmic Crisp’s website noted.Just over 450,000 40lb boxes of the Cosmic Crisp crop were expected to be shipped to retailers across the US on Sunday, according to the Spokane-based Spokesman-Review. The producers hope the shipments will grow to 2.1m boxes in 2020. For those who can’t wait for their local grocery store to stock them, four apples were retailing for $39 online over the weekend.The initial 600,000 Cosmic Crisp trees were sold to farmers in 2017, researchers reportedly said. Since then, more than 10m Cosmic Crisp trees were planted, Kate Evans, who heads the university’s Pome Fruit Breeding Program, told the Spokesman-Review.Asked for comment on the apple’s release, Evans told  in an email it’s “very exciting to finally see it available for consumers.”Addressing skepticism about the apple, Evans emphasized that Cosmic Crisp was not made through genetic modification but instead, a technique named “cross-hybridization”.Evans said the idea of crossing the two varieties was to make an apple that featured both Enterprise’s resistance to browning and disease and Honeycrisp’s sweet flavour.Washington is the top apple producing state in the US, and Gala and Red Delicious are the most popular varieties sold. Scott McIlrath, a grower who planted 5,000 Cosmic Crisp trees, told KIMA: “I think that will benefit all varieties and the apple growers as a whole.”But, he noted, “the real impact of cosmic crisp sales won’t be felt to the farmer for another two to three years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a5ec28e01a62771ef854c61e6e16e5e6f98cc1/0_1821_5508_3302/master/5508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ded651c48b9e973070338f8d9178e16e","title":"nigel slater roast chicken pasta and cauliflower cheese recipes","story":"On chilly days, cosset yourself with carbs and creamy saucesThe first truly cold days of the year sent me in search of the earthenware gratin dish, the cream and the carbs. I longed for smoked garlic or bacon, soothing starch and puddles of cheese sauce. Food not to excite and inspire but to soothe and cosset. Suddenly, eating is about central heating, bolstering ourselves against the wind and the rain.I don’t often toss pasta in cream – I find the marriage too soporific – but this week I couldn’t get the idea out of my mind. Pasta shapes with ridges or hollows that would hold a sauce and carry a smoky flavour or two vegetables that are at their happiest hidden under a blanket of pale, parmesan crusted sauce that’s hot enough to melt the coldest heart.I upgraded a common or garden cauliflower cheese this week by infusing its ivory sauce with smoked garlic. A savoury note was added with nigella seeds, tiny dots of onion-flavoured crunchiness so perfect I can’t think why I haven’t added them before. A first-class side dish, we ate it as a main, mounds of cream-coloured curds on a pillow of brown basmati I had steamed with a cinnamon stick and sprig of bay leaves.It is not a necessity that such dinners be frugal in nature, but they often are. Potato or pasta-based suppers rarely break the bank, which is why we can splash out on a tub of cream to serve them with. I made a chicken and pasta recipe whose deep flavour came from deglazing baked-on roasting juices with cream. The dish was made from scratch using cheap, brown thigh meat, but a slightly second-best version could have used the remains of the Sunday roast. “Second best” only in its lack of roasting juices to enrich the sauce. Those would already have been nicked, greedily, for the gravy.If you are making this from scratch then I suggest chicken thighs, but you could use leftover roast chicken instead. I always include roasting juices and the flavoursome jelly from under the bird.Serves 4, generouslyrosemary sprigs 4black peppercorns 8olive oil 4 tbspchicken thighs 1 kgpasta enough for 4, such as fusilli or trofie tarragon 7gparsley 10glemon 1pine kernels 75gdouble cream 500mlSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Pull the leaves from the rosemary then put them in a mortar with the black peppercorns and 1 tsp of sea salt. Grind to a coarse powder then blend in the olive oil.Put the chicken, skin side down, in a roasting tin, pour over the herbed oil and turn to evenly coat. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Remove the chicken from the oven and leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then remove the meat from the bones. Take care to preserve as many of the juices as possible. Tear the chicken into large pieces.Cook the pasta in the boiling water for about 9 minutes. While it’s cooking, pull the tarragon and parsley leaves from their stems and roughly chop. Finely grate the lemon rind and add to the herbs. Toast the pine kernels in a shallow pan for a few minutes until golden then toss them in, too.Drain the pasta. Place the roasting tin over a moderate heat and pour in the double cream, stirring to dissolve any caramelised roasting juices. Add the chicken and pasta, transfer to a warm serving dish, scatter over the tarragon crumbs and serve.I use cheddar here, but only because it was what I had to hand. Cheese sauce is very forgiving – it’s a fine place to make the best of ends of cheeses that need using, and soft varieties are as acceptable as anything.

Break the cauliflower into large florets, discarding the tougher stalks.Pour the milk into a saucepan and place over a moderate heat. Break the head of garlic into cloves, peel away the flaky skin, then squeeze the soft dark flesh from each clove into the milk. When the milk is hot, but before it boils, remove from the heat and leave it to infuse with the garlic for 20 minutes.Put a pan of water on to boil and steam the cauliflower over it for 5-7 minutes. (You could boil it if you prefer.)Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Melt the butter in a pan then stir in the flour and cook for 5 or 6 minutes, stirring constantly whilst slowly adding the milk and garlic. You want a smooth sauce that will coat the back of the spoon. Grate the cheddar and stir into the sauce then season with salt and black pepper.

Leicester kept the Premier League title race alive here by plundering a win in stoppage time, Kelechi Iheanacho’s goal keeping Brendan Rodgers’ side within striking distance of Liverpool. Yes, eight points is within striking distance for this impressive Leicester side, who have now scored more goals and conceded fewer than Liverpool this season.As for Marco Silva’s reign at Everton, maybe that will be over soon. But if the Portuguese is sacked, it will not be because of this performance. Everton played well, forcing Leicester to show all of their resourcefulness to dig out a victory. Six wins on the trot represents Leicester’s best run since 1962-63. They finished fourth that season but are a good bet to do better this. The champions back then, by the way, were Everton. A repeat of that is not on the cards any time soon, even if they did well here, taking the lead through Richarlison before Jamie Vardy and Iheanacho hit back for hosts who never stop believing.“It was a really harsh result for us, for 60-65 minutes we were the best team,” remarked Silva, who said he would not waste time thinking about the implications for his continued employment. “I’m not the right person to ask about that. I know what is my job. Tomorrow will be another day for me to prepare another training session.”Given the respective form of the teams going into this game, it seemed as if an Everton win would require something close to miraculous. One might have thought that Silva’s strategy, with a new three-man central defence, smacked of a Hail Mary. But in fairness to the beleaguered manager, it turned out to have been immaculately conceived.Leicester struggled for long periods to find openings in the visitors’ defence. Everton’s players certainly did not lie down to sacrifice their manager, applying the gameplan with dynamism and discipline. “I never had doubts about that,” Silva said.His team also carried a threat on the counterattack and he could take satisfaction in the eighth minute from seeing his wing-backs combine to dangerous effect, with Lucas Digne crossing from the left for Djibril Sidibé, whose shot from the edge of the box whizzed just over the bar.Leicester have not been accustomed to being blunted and outgunned this season. They started to pass and move faster in an effort to unhinge Everton. Ayoze Pérez registered their first shot on target in the 10th minute but it was a weak effort. Pérez did better moments later, skedaddling between Michael Keane and Yerry Mina before firing just past the far post.Mostly, though, Everton absorbed the hosts’ pressure well. Then they took the lead with a fine attack.It began with a throw-in in their own half. Richarlison received it on the left, flipping the ball off to a teammate and scampering forward. When Alex Iwobi slid it out to Sidibé on the other flank, the Frenchman delivered a splendid cross and Richarlison darted in front of Ricardo Pereira and directed a terrific header beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 10 yards.“We went behind and that’s when you see the mentality and quality of your team,” said Rodgers. Mina had to make two excellent blocks to prevent an equaliser, denying Pérez and Jonny Evans. But Leicester kept coming and in the 33rd minute they thought they had the perfect opportunity to draw level when the referee pointed to the spot after Ben Chilwell went down following a wild swing by Mason Holgate. The defender missed the ball and forced Chilwell to take evasive action – but apparently that did not justify a penalty according to the VAR official, who advised the referee to overturn the original decision.Everton were first to threaten in the second half, Keane going close from a corner by Gylfi Sigurdsson. That drew a sharp retort from Leicester, Wilfred Ndidi winning the ball in midfield before offloading to Pereira, who charged forward before drilling a low shot goalwards. Jordan Pickford tipped it wide.Rodgers replaced Pérez with Iheanacho on the hour, instructing the newcomer to play closer to Vardy. Within six minutes the change paid off, as Iheanacho collected a pass from Ndidi and crossed low for Vardy to tap in from close range.With Leicester pressing for the win, the Everton substitute Moise Kean came close to scoring on the counterattack, his chip from 20 yards narrowly missing the target. Most of the action was at the other end, however, with Leicester attacking in waves. Their relentlessness was rewarded in stoppage time, when Pereira stormed forward and fed Iheanacho, who finished smartly.The goal was originally disallowed for offside but this time VAR intervened in Leicester’s favour, ruling that Iheanacho was onside thanks to the position of Mina’s knee. Sometimes a match, a title race and a manager’s future can come down to fine margins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29311922d96d4b447102eed304989ea4dc2c4382/140_105_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020f961cf9853e749615034a78325ece","title":"manchester city women liverpool women wsl match report","story":"Gemma Bonner’s first-half header ensured Manchester City leapfrog Chelsea and stay level with Arsenal at the top of the Women’s Super League, despite a resolute performance from a Liverpool team still searching for a first league win of the season.“I’m still smiling,” said Liverpool manager Vicky Jepson. “The performance was there. Last week we saw Arsenal run the ball into the corner to waste time, this week we’ve seen City do it, that’s a huge compliment to our players and their work rate and effort.”Liverpool have never won away to Manchester City in the WSL but their visit to the Academy Stadium was buoyed by the narrowness of their 1-0 defeat by the champions Arsenal the preceding Sunday. That the Gunners were hammering Bristol City 11-1 in the earlier kick-off will have no doubted added to a sense that something was achieved at Meadow Park, despite Jepson’s team still being winless and bottom of the WSL table.Liverpool do seem to be improving. Their league defeats have been narrow ones. Just two have exceeded the one-goal margin (2-0 defeats to Manchester United and Birmingham the anomalies). But Manchester City presented a different kind of challenge. Where Arsenal have now conceded four times in eight games, offering teams a glimmer of hope at catching them out, City are rock solid. The only goal they have shipped was in a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.“We’ve been resilient and fought hard to make sure it was three points and not one,” said the manager Nick Cushing of the win. “One week you can win 1-0 the next week you can win 11-1,” he said after being told Arsenal’s result. “We’re just trying to make sure we get points and continue to push them.”The threat of City was evident early on. A Keira Walsh shot, hit first time, was tipped over by Anke Preuss. Sophie Bradley-Auckland’s late recovery nicked the ball off the feet of Lauren Hemp as the youngster raced goalwards with just the keeper to beat.The visiting team’s closest chance came when a goalmouth scramble saw Jade Bailey find Courtney Sweetman-Kirk but England striker Ellen White blocked her eventual shot.City broke the deadlock on the 20-minute mark, and it was beautifully simple. A 25-yard free-kick was floated on to the head of Bonner, a former Liverpool defender, by Caroline Weir who nodded in. White had the chance to double their lead shortly after, Walsh having snuck the ball between the lines to the forward but, forced wide, her shot from an acute angle was nudged past the far post by Preuss.For City, every point matters. With Chelsea unbeaten, but with a game in hand after their match at Everton was called off due to a frozen pitch, Manchester City needed to take advantage of a chance to leapfrog the London club, to sit level with Arsenal on 21 points. Arsenal’s mammoth win though, means that they also needed goals. With 14 scored in their last three games, the likelihood of them punishing Liverpool was high, but with Bailey and Rhiannon Roberts sitting in front of the back four the home side struggled to penetrate.Their solidity at the back gave the visitors confidence. And with 70 minutes on the clock they launched a period of sustained pressure on City’s resolute defence, a spell which culminated in a Bailey shot being acrobatically tipped over by Ellie Roebuck, and a scramble that saw Niamh Charles’ eventual header stopped at point-blank range by the young keeper.“Two minutes’ extra time left and our players were still busting a gut to try and get something from it so there’s no stress here, there’s no worries in our camp,” said Jepson.“Liverpool have improved performances and they had a positive performance against Arsenal so we knew they would come here trying to get something,” said Cushing. “We knew it was going to be dangerous. I just thought we lacked a little bit of control in the second half - a little bit of fatigue came in and we looked tired.“We now go to Chelsea for a really important game next week. We want to make sure in the head-to-heads we are challenging so towards the end of the season we’re in the top two and challenging for a trophy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dcd70b6995c9dc5209861ff559a27612cef9a05/0_20_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d0b5abd2ace4517c3156f3d22078264","title":"atletico madrid barcelona la liga live","story":"76 mins: The TrippierMorata combo clicks into gear again, the full-back bending a pass down the line and into his striker’s path, who gets off a volley under pressure, but it’s well over.72 mins: Off the line! Correa hares into the box and fires in a low cross, which Morata meets with a backheeled flick – but Lenglet is waiting on to slice clear.71 mins: Pique, already on a booking, goes sliding recklessly in on Morata, who’s haring down the left, and gets nowhere near the ball, sending Morata sprawling to the ground. The referee takes a long hard look… and gives only a free-kick. Laughable! Gerard Pique you lucky man!68 mins: Thomas spread the ball to the onrushing Trippier down the right, whose cross is blocked. The corner is half-cleared, sent back into the corridor of uncertainty – but no one can get a touch – before Barca spring a lightning break, Messi bustling through all sorts of fouls before laying off to Suarez, who chips square to Griezmann, who volleys wildly over. Vitolo is booked for the foul on Messi.64 mins: All of a sudden the game has become wide open, another clearcut chance for Barcelona, Messi’s side-foot effort saved after he meets De Jong’s cutback, before Pique stretches desperately to prevent Joao Felix running clean through. Then Barca attack again, Suarez firing over. Joao Felix is taken off for Vitolo – not a change the home crowd approves of.60 mins: Messi takes aim from 20 yards and rifles in a low drive, which Oblak gets down to before smothering the follow-up.59 mins: De Jong picks up possession on halfway and sashays forward – and Griezmann is clean through in the inside-left if only he can pick him out! But he takes an age to spot the pass, and when he does he overhits it horribly, much to his teammate’s anguish.55 mins: Barca are turning the screw now – but then out of nothing, a brilliant counterattack from the hosts, Herrera stealing possession and sidestepping his way through a crowd in midfield before unleashing Morata down the left. He scoots forward, draws the defender, and squares to Thomas, but his shot is saved. This is one hell of a nil-nil.53 mins: Messi prowls around the edge of the area, looking for an opening that isn’t quite there. Eventually Morata steams back to dispossess him, and Atletico spring a counter down the right, cut short by a great sliding challenge from Lenglet.48 mins: Barcelona are really dominating the ball now, but they can’t get anywhere with it, with every pass into a dangerous area cut out, every dribble crowded out. Atletico are taking every opportunity to break quickly and in numbers. This may be how the second half will play out.47 mins: Barcelona get us restarted with a bit of ball-hogging, before Griezmann unleashes from range, comfortably saved. Cue whistles.Anyway, we’re back in action. Barcelona kick off.Re: the kit. It’s not good, clearly. But by the standards of football kits, is it that bad? It’s arguably not even the worst Barca kit, which for my money was this tequila-sunrise number a few years back:“What is it with the design of this Barcelona alternatethird jersey?,” asks Peter Oh. “Were they going for a scratched-by-a-velociraptor look?”(Also known as the Bob Peck?) Terrific half. Plenty of wonderfully assured play from both sides, and no shortage of chances all round. All that’s missing is, well, a goal.44 mins: The first glimpse of Messi’s latent capacity to take out an entire team single-handedly – he dribbles around the edge of the box, encircled by defenders, but keeps the ball like a magnet. He plays it wide and looks for the return, but doesn’t get it. Roberto’s high cross comes to nothing.42 mins: Barca hit the bar! Pique with the perfect mirror-image to the chance Morata had a minute before, meeting an outswinging corner. He heads the ball down, too, but it bounces up against the crossbar.40 mins: Another phenomenal piece of goalkeeping from Ter Stegen, clawing away a header from Morata, who met a corner with a towering leap. He headed it powerfully downwards, and it bounced right in front of Ter Stegen, who readjusted brilliantly to scoop it away.38 mins: Atletico are playing it out from the back with astounding calm, but here they lose the ball in midfield and a lovely bit of one-touch play from Barcelona sees Griezmann lay off to Suarez 25 yards out, and the Uruguayan unleashes a fearsome half-volley that flashes just wide.35 mins: More brilliance from Arthur, wriggling away from Herrera and pinging a lovely ball up to Messi, who has two men to beat and can only win a corner, which he overhits wildly.32 mins: Arthur, who is growing into the game, bursts forward and feeds Messi, who is tackled(!). Morata tries to break clear but is rugby tackled by Rakitic, who absurdly escapes a booking. Seconds later, Pique repeats the trick on Joao Felix, and does get a yellow.29 mins: Barcelona have woken up. They play some of their old keep-ball, which comes to an end when Griezmann thunders into a slide tackle, to a deafening chorus of whistles. This is a high-class game.26 mins: Great chance for Barcelona! They should be ahead, Messi nicking the ball off off a fast-asleep Herrera and squaring for the Croatian, but the pass forces him just away from goal and he can’t quite get the purchase on the shot. Saved. 24 mins: More purposeful attacking from the hosts, who work the ball beautifully down the left but can’t quite work a clearcut chance. Barca’s counterattack is snuffed out instantly, and Atletico turn the screw again with Herrera bending one wide from just inside the box. They’re all over Barcelona here.22 mins: Atletico steal possession in the final third and have a great chance to spring a four-on-three attack, but Correa gets his pass all wrong. Will they come to regret these moments…?19 mins: Koke puts in the cross, cleared, but it comes back in to the back post where Joao Felix is waiting, practically underneath the crossbar, and has to score! He takes the volley with his side-foot, but it hits a star-jumping Ter Stegen on the inside of his thigh, trickles across the goal line and out for a corner. Unbelievable!18 mins: Another free-kick to Atletico, this time right on the edge of the box, Junior wrestling Correa to the ground.16 mins: Trippier whips in a beauty of a delivery, met aggressively by a rising Felipe whose header goes over. That could – should? – have been a goal.16 mins: The teams are taking turns to keep the ball and slowly move forward. Atletico are doing more with the possession, though, and Trippier looks for Morata again with a cross, which is cleared, before winning a free-kick out wide. 12 mins: Barca enjoy their first sustained spell of possession, but they meet a brick wall each time they try any really penetrative passing. De Jong tries something different, running in behind from midfield, but he’s eased away from the ball by a vigilant Hermoso. 9 mins: Atletico are on top here, and are getting joy down their right. He feeds a lovely pass into the box to Morata, who holds off Pique, swivels and fires in a shot that needs saving. Corner.6 mins: Trippier picks out Correa down the right, who wins a corner. After a scrambled clearance, it breaks wide to Hermoso, and his driven cross hits first Lenglet and then the far post. That could have gone anywhere.5 mins: Herrera intercepts a Suarez pass and stays ice-cool under pressure from De Jong to play it out from the back. Nice. But Barca are pressing with vigour.3 mins: The stadium erupts in fierce whistles as Griezmann gets his first touch. No real rhythm to either side’s play so far: it’s been belting it down here, and the pitch it soaking.1 min: And we’re off. Thomas Partey belts it into the mixer, and Atletico win a series of throw-ins, ending when Morata tries a ludicrously hopeful long ranger that trickles wide.The teams are out. Handshakes are exchanged and the managers share a friendly hug. That’s the niceties over with.So Antoine Griezmann starts – replacing the injured Ousmane Dembele – but with Ivan Rakitic coming in for the suspended Sergio Busquets, we have a Barcelona midfield with precisely none of the Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets trio that pretty much defined the club’s previous decade and a half. Which isn’t exactly new, but is still weird.An attacking lineup from Simeone, too, with both Joao Felix and Alvaro Morata up top – they’ll fancy their chances against this Barca defence. But will Atletico look to take the game to the visitors (which is what Barcelona are least comfortable dealing with), or soak up the pressure and spring on the counter (which is what they are most comfortable doing)?Some pre-match reading, from Sid Lowe, on the strange riddle of Barcelona:Are Barcelona European football’s weirdest team? For a start, they’re nothing like the tirelessly scurrying, ball-hogging, even-greater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts team that we became used to for so many years. Instead, this lot are a tad scruffy in possession. Not the most willing pressers. And reliant on flashes of inidual magic rather than the slow asphyxiation of collective dominance.Nothing wrong with that, except it doesn’t leave you much to fall back on if your big men don’t turn up. Luckily Barcelona have a big man who rarely fails to turn up – although even Lionel Messi is raising more than his fair share of questions this season: does his brilliance when he has the ball justify his doing absolutely nothing when he doesn’t? And at what point does the repeated struggles of the forwards brought in to play alongside him start to point towards an awkward common denominator?So far, Barcelona have been muddling along with a Keeganesque “You score four, we’ll score five” approach, but today they meet their direct opposites in Atlético Madrid, who have the best defence in the league but the lowest-scoring attack outside the bottom six. Unstoppable force? Immoveable object?Victory for these sides’ common enemy last night means that Barça must win to reclaim top spot, while a win for Atlético would draw them level on points with their opponents. Last year, it took a last-minute goal from Ousmane Dembele to deny them the win – but last year they could also count on Antoine Griezmann, whose summer defection means he lines up for the visitors tonight. What more motivation should Diego Simeone’s men need? Strap in.

Gylfi Sigurdsson speaks, and is honest about what went wrong for Everton. He doesn’t choose to dispute the winner because VAR:It was very disappointing. The shape we set up with suited us well. We felt were solid and it was devastating to lose it at the end. We have come away with as many points as last week. The performance was better than last week. We have to stick together and stay positive. We have a few games coming up to put things right.Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheancho have been talking to Sky.JV: We have had decisions go against with VAR and this one went for it. KI: I have been waiting for the opportunity and I knew it would come. It’s about making sure I was working to this standard. It was fantastic for the whole team. You need to be strong mentally. It’s not easy not playing. Jamie is a top lad and a top striker and I am learning from him. JV: Kel came on and we started creating chances. He deserves it. He’s been absolutely amazing in training. Leicester are up to second in the league, leaving Pep Guardiola trailing in their dust. Once they levelled, and a little against the run of play, they were by far the likeliest to win it. Full-time at Old Trafford: Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa. Jack Grealish’s goal the highlight there, it seems. Kenwright, one of football’s most expressive men, is doing his best to look impassive as he knows the camera is on him. Marco Silva is already in the tunnel it has been left to Luis Boa Morte to remonstrate with the referee. Oh Marco, oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no. And footage of Bill Kenwright shows that the axe must surely be looming. Kelechi Iheanacho was superb off the bench. He cannot have played much better than that. But it’s desolation for Everton.90+7 min: Who says that VAR kills passion? The stadium went crazy after that period of pent-up frustration. Goal? No, VAR. Iheanacho on to a Tielemans pass and scores the winner. The offside flag is up, and then it’s ruled out. Well, for now. The video shows the Nigerian had been played onside. 90+2 min: Sidibe is up and making the most of his injury Everton eyeing up the draw.90+1 min: Leicester push for their winner even though Sidibe is down after a collision with Iheanacho. He is grabbing his knee, and appears to be suggesting he is badly hurt. 90 min: Three minutes added on to the 90. 89 min: Silva looks as nervous as hell. As it stands, he probably does get the Merseyside derby to redeem himself. Though good luck with that. 88 min: Michael Keane has taken a whack, which slows down the action for a few seconds. But the pace picks up once again as Leicester chase the win. 87 min: Everton have not entirely given up on winning this: Richarlison has a shot blocked after briefly finding space. Neither, of course, have Leicester. Ricardo’s shot is bundled behind for a corner that Pickford claims and sets up another attack.85 min: Jamie Vardy sees to have taken a bash to his hooter and has to leave the field for a moment. A flashpoint between Soyuncu follows, as the Turk gets bounced into the advertising boards and lets Kean know his disquiet. Kean is not for backing down, either. 83 min: Tielemans shoots this time, but wide. The chances piling up for Leicester just as the problems are for a pensive Marco Silva. 81 min: Leicester sub: On comes Albrighton for Harvey Barnes, who was looking lively right up until the point he was hauled off. 80 min: And Kean almost made an instant impact. Seeing Schmeicherl off his line he attempts a speculative one, and the ball whips just wide of the post. Schmeichel was nowhere near the ball, and was beaten all ends up. Some of the crowd thought that was in. 79 min: Double Everton sub: Iwobi and Calvert-Lewin off, and Moises Kean and Morgan Schneiderlin on. That seems to be full rejig midfield.78 min: Tielemans almost forced a chance, but his pass inside was a waste as Iheanacho and Vardy were queueing up. 76 min: Everton are looking ragged now when they had previously seemed organised and confident. That lapse for Vardy’s goal showed off their fragility. 74 min: Leicester now forcing big chances. Iheanacho gives them a let-off when he oversteps the ball and then Vardy’s header from Tielemans’ cross has Pickford panicking. 73 min: Close! Barnes and Vardy combine and then the ball comes inside. Maddison forces a save from Pickford that the goalkeeper cannot have known too much about until the ball was in his grasp. 71 min: Leicester fans now loud and hitting their clackers hard. Everton looking a little downcast, as well they might, but they are at least pushing on for a winner.70 min: Now, this is a test for Everton, a real test. Vardy appeared like a ghostly apparition, having not been in the contest at all, to score. Brendan Rodgers will take the credit for his change - it was Iheanacho who set up the goal.By the by, it’s Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa, with Tyrone Mings getting the equaliser. Oh dear, Everton. Lovely work from Ndidi then to Iheanacho, and then at the back post it’s Vardy who scores from close range.66 min: Two-thirds of the game to go and this looks like something of a tactical coup for Marco Silva. Though if it goes wrong from here, that would look like a felling blow. Latest score: Manchester 2-1 Aston Villa, with Victor Lindelof getting it. 64 min: More Everton attacking. Are Leicester trying to call them on to open up space or are they struggling with an inspired opponent? Kelechi has a shot, but it represents no threat to Pickford.62 min: Leicester sub: Kelelchi Iheanacho for Ayoze Perez, who has rather disappeared from the contest...meanwhile, Mason Holgate found himself with space to shoot - and possibly a nosebleed - but took too much time and saw his effort blocked. Everton are the better team here and they were nearly ahead when Richarlison pings in a cross that Iwobi cannot get to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707e7ef08667dd87fb4c1f1eab7db319f8f9c35b/0_3752_8708_5224/master/8708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27684ee3b2c53a05cd983036f98de663","title":"animal magic how my pet saved me","story":"From Wolfy the lurcher to Trixie the hamster, these affectionate animals helped five people get their lives back on trackThere were a lot of things that were a bit awry about my life. The main problem was that I went out and didn’t come home. I’d go on these benders that were incredibly destructive to my wellbeing. And then when I was working, I’d never leave the house. I’d just sit in front of the laptop thinking about all the work I had to do, moping, writing, moping again. I felt frozen in time. Unable to move forward.There are some things you don’t question because they’re family lore and in my family it was that you can’t have a dog in London. But when I met my boyfriend and we got a flat together, I realised I really, really wanted a dog.After many failed attempts, we found a man who was getting rid of a lurcher. The night before we met him, I was out and someone offered me drugs. I said: “No, I’m getting a dog in the morning.” They looked at me like, “So?” But it felt massive to me. That morning, my boyfriend and I drove to a place near the M25 to meet the man with the lurcher. The dog walked towards us and was a bit sad-looking, really dirty and smelled terrible. But he was still so elegant and funny, too.It was exciting having this other little soul come into our tiny orbit. I put myself on “peternity leave” and Wolfy, as we called him, and I just hung out for a while. We’d go for lunch together and on lots of walks. He loved it.Obviously he’s simple, he’s an animal, but his presence pulled me out of myself and centred me back to a calm part of myself. I was 45 and had worked as a freelancer in London for 25 years and was pretty hardened. But he softened me and helped me love unconditionally. I now had a reason to come home at night. I still went to parties, but in a less destructive way. Sometimes I’d take him with me and he’d just look at me like, “What the fuck? Let’s go home.” And I’d be like, “Yeah, you’re right.”It’s been an ongoing thing since then to disentangle from doing things that harm me. And to do things that make my short time on this earth joyful and positive Wolfy is my daily lesson in how to live that life.Kate Spicer’s book Lost Dog: A Love Story is published by Ebury. Order it for £14.95 from bookshopWe got Missy as a kitten and gave her that name because she was quite the a. Our family immediately loved her, but she didn’t necessarily show that she loved us back. She didn’t like being picked up or cuddled. Everything was on her terms. In April 2013, when she was less than one year old, we were all playing on the floor when she jumped on my chest and I thought, “Ooh, that hurt a little.” After that, whenever I was lying down she’d lie on me and paw at this one spot on my right breast. If I moved her paw, she’d put it back in the same place. If I was sitting down, she’d get up on my lap and nudge her head there. She started following me around everywhere. She wasn’t like that with anyone else.It was three months of that behaviour before I admitted it wasn’t going to stop. I knew it sounded crazy to go to the doctor and say, “My cat keeps bothering me,” but I had some discomfort, too. The doctor found atypical cells and calcification in the same spot Missy had been nudging. It wasn’t full-blown breast cancer, but it had the potential to change, so I had an operation to remove the cells.I felt so grateful to Missy I wouldn’t have gone to the doctor if it hadn’t been for her. I’d heard of dogs doing that kind of thing, but not cats. When I got home I rewarded her with some Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s prawns – rather than the Asda ones that she’s used to.As my wound healed she backed off and went back to her aloof self. It was weird for me. I felt like maybe she didn’t love me as much any more. I was back to being treated like everyone else. But I was comforted that there was a reason for her behaviour.One night two years later, she came and lay on my chest in bed. I said to my partner: “Do you think she’s trying to tell me something?” He laughed it off. But the next night was the same. She started following me again. It was really unsettling. I’d got used to her barely bothering to get off the bed. When I went back to the same doctor with no symptoms other than my cat pestering me I had to plead with her to believe me. She sent me to the hospital and I was given the same diagnosis and they did the same operation again. It was the same consultant and team. They were fantastic – and believed me. Not everyone does, but that’s up to them.Two years later when it all happened a third time, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were eight areas of calcification in my breast. I had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery and they removed the lymph nodes.That was 2017. Thankfully, Missy’s been consistently aloof since then and I’ve been fine. I know it sounds strange but I feel as if she saved my life. She will forever be my hero, whether she likes it or not.When I first got Biggie, I had a job, a house, a girlfriend. He was six months old and about 18in long. But about six months into having him, I went through a bad spell of mental health. As a result, I lost my job, then my house, broke up with my girlfriend, and was almost declared bankrupt. Everything just toppled on me. I had anxiety and I was very easily irritated. I don’t blame them, but my family and friends eventually became sick of me. It felt like Biggie was the only being not giving me grief and I just felt this closeness to him.But it was a struggle for me to keep hold of him. No landlords wanted to take us in and I was left homeless. People hear “iguana” and they think, “Oh God, it’s going to rip everything apart.” I spent three months living on my mum’s sofa, paying friends to look after Biggie. I fell out with my mum for not taking him in. For a period, he lived in Bristol and I went back and forth every day to see him, because obviously all the moving and being apart from each other was stressful for the lizard as well.I’d lost everything in my life, but he was my partner in crime and the only thing I was living for. I can’t imagine how much harder that time would have been without him. Keeping him alive saved my life.Eventually I got a place in Chippenham. He’s grown to four-and-a-half-foot long now. He thinks he’s a cat and just loves attention. When I do the dishes, he comes and sits on my head. If I turn my face, he’ll give me a little lick on the lips. With certain people he’ll climb up their leg and sit and stare at them until they start stroking him. When he outgrew his vivarium, I set out basking areas with UV lights, and now he roams free around the house. I bathe him twice a day because he’s a rainforest lizard. He makes a fuss to get in the tub, but loves it once he’s in. My girlfriend works in an expensive supermarket and Biggie loves their fruit, which is quite a pricey habit. His favourite is Candyfloss grapes. At night, he sits on my chest and I put my dressing gown over us. Luckily, my girlfriend loves him, too.So often in my life I feel like what I say or what I do is going to have a grave consequence, but with Trixie I don’t feel that way. When I shut the bedroom door to be with her, she’s so present in the room, everything else just goes away.I have OCD which stems from guilt towards a lot of things. As a child, my family had a house fire and one of my little brothers passed away. After that, if I heard a noise in the night, I had to sit up to check everything was OK if I didn’t, I’d feel like there would be another fire. I became obsessed with thinking about accidents. Every 10 minutes I was imagining falling and would have the physical feeling you get just before you fall. It was about me, my boyfriend, anyone around me.But Trixie helped change that. Late last summer, I started medication and got her not long afterwards. Hamsters need a lot of care and having a positive impact on her through feeding, changing her bedding, just making the right choices, really helped me. Watching Trixie play, sniff around, climb all over me, I found myself smiling on my own, which is not something I do. It was such a light feeling of joy. And a break from my thoughts.Our boxroom is her room now. I love changing her cage. I think, “Well, what might she find interesting?” I know her different moods and have learned her favourite treat is watermelon. I still get the obsessive thoughts, but I can choose to let them go and think of Trixie.She doesn’t know how much she means to me. Or how I feel. But that doesn’t matter. There’s something to be said for getting comfort from another being without telling them why you’re upset. Obviously I know hamsters don’t live forever and hate the thought of her dying, but I know I’m giving her the best life possible. And she gives me so much back.The first time I saw Oxford he was a puppy. I thought, “He needs someone to look after him how’s he going to help me?” But within months, he had changed my life. I can’t bend down any more so when I drop things, which is all the time, he picks them up. He helps me get dressed. If I ask him, he gets the landline phone. He kind of stands and puts his paws around the handset and then grabs it with his jaws, very gently. It’s especially helpful when I’ve had a fall.Back in 2010, I was working as a nurse in Glasgow and writing my dissertation for my master’s when I started to get this feeling like I had cushions under my heels, within days it turned into unbearable pain. I was having lunch with my girlfriend when I realised I couldn’t stand up on my own. Later that year I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.Physically, the disease made me uncoordinated and I became unstable. I had to give in to using a wheelchair. To me, it felt like the end of the road. I used to love cycling from Glasgow to Loch Lomond and running. I couldn’t stand looking out of the window at people going about their normal life. My girlfriend and I broke up and my family were all in Tehran. I had to move out of the city to find a bungalow. I didn’t know anyone in my new town and just spent my time on my own behind the computer watching movies. My physiotherapist suggested I get a dog through the charity Canine Partners.Oxford was key to reconnecting me to the world. He made me get out of the house to take him for walks. I started sailing and playing wheelchair basketball. He’s changed my body image, too. When I used to go shopping I felt like this strange thing everyone was staring at in the middle of the shopping centre. When you’re at a lower level to everyone else, you can think of yourself as not a part of society. But with him next to me, more people say hello or approach me and ask about him.His foster parents, from when he was a puppy, Jan and Peter, live in Sussex and we’ve become close. They come to visit us once a year and we travel around Scotland. I can’t believe how pessimistic I was before I got him. He’s my best mate and we’ve become a great team.Majid has received support from the MS Society"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c51a2ba63477a945b01ae6e109176be16f5ab50/0_472_7087_4252/master/7087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32dbecd4df5b3b62d8b7a961d57d7fdf","title":"emilia clarke i didnt want people to think of me as sick ","story":"As she stars in this year’s Christmas feelgood movie, Emilia Clarke talks about the intense scrutiny of Game of Thrones, how she coped with the brain haemorrhage that almost killed her – and why we all need to escape reality sometimesEmilia Clarke had a headache. It was 2011, just before Valentine’s Day and just after she’d wrapped on the first series of Game of Thrones, playing Daenerys Targaryen, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons. She didn’t yet know, as she crawled into the locker room of her local gym in north London and vomited bile into the toilet, that Game of Thrones would run for seven further seasons, break Emmy-award records for most wins for a scripted television series and for a drama, be named one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and quickly come to define her. But there was much she didn’t know.She didn’t know that at 24 she had suffered a life-threatening stroke, a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain. She didn’t know, as she lay on the floor repeating lines from Game of Thrones in order to test her memory, that a third of SAH patients die immediately, or that those who survive require urgent treatment to avoid a second, often fatal bleed. She didn’t know there was another swollen blood vessel in her brain, which had doubled in size by the time she finished filming season three. She didn’t know that one day, eight years later, over biscuits on her pink sofa, she would be smiling with the dark realisation that her stroke was one of the best things that could have happened to her.Her pink sofa is in her pink house, which is also green and blue and muted shades of rust, and has a secret bar hidden in a courtyard shed, and an outdoor screening room heated by a wood-burning stove. To walk into her living room, where one corner is painted with a symbol relating to her mum, another to her late dad, and a third with a meaningful dragon, is to enter the cosiest corner of Clarke’s mind. By the stairs, horsehair is visible in the plaster the walls are stripped back to the bone. She shows me round with a raw sort of glee, a sense that her comfort and safety are bound into the details: the friends’ art on the walls, the “single girl’s” bedroom. She moved in after Game of Thrones in this and many ways, her life can be cleanly dissected into before and after.Before, Clarke, now 33, who grew up in Oxfordshire, had appeared in a single episode of the daytime soap Doctors. She was ambitious, optimistic and relentlessly cheerful. After, after Game of Thrones, and the death of her father, which shook her family, as did her life-threatening stroke, she is sitting on her pink sofa and contemplating a decade that changed her.“And yes, I’m at the point where I definitely think of the brain haemorrhage as a good thing,” she nods. She has extremely expressive eyebrows that appear jointed – for every word Clarke says, and she says many, they add 15 more. “Because I was never destined to be the ‘young actor goes off the rails’ type, up and down the gossip columns. And having a brain haemorrhage that coincided precisely with the beginning of my career and the beginning of a show that became something quite meaty, it gave me a perspective that I wouldn’t have had otherwise.” She pauses. “I’m quite a resilient human being, so a parent dying and brain haemorrhages coinciding with success and people following you in the street and getting stalkers – you’re just, like, ‘Well let’s try and make something sensible of it.’”It was a decade that contained the very best and very worst of a life, and one of the sensible things she tried to make of it was the founding of a charity, SameYou, to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke. It was only in order to promote the charity that, eight years after her stroke, she finally decided to talk about it, in a piece for the New Yorker. “On the set, I didn’t miss a beat, but I struggled,” she wrote, of returning to Game of Thrones after brain surgery. “Season two would be my worst. I didn’t know what Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.”It’s remarkable, considering her profile and her regular appearances in the Daily Mail in lovely dresses and grand smiles, that she managed to keep it secret for so long. She didn’t want to tell strangers, “Because it was mine.” She feared, too, that people would “sneer at it”.It so happened that, the week before I went to meet her, I had a similar (though less dramatic) neurological diagnosis – when I tell her about it, for some reason my voice shakes. She is warm and quick with recommendations, and as she continues she says, “Well, you know, then. You know the worries. That people will think your soul, your movement, your voice, who you were,” was damaged. “It was nerve-racking to share it, to be honest. It always is, when you make yourself vulnerable.” She waited so long to talk about it, because, “I didn’t want people to think of me as… sick.”There are still days on set when she will quietly pull aside the makeup person and say, “‘I think I’m having a brain haemorrhage. I’m not, I promise, but maybe just put me in a cold tent and we’ll sit down for a second, and I apologise in advance if I freak you out.’ Over the summer I was burning the candle at both ends, and I was with my mate on the plane. And I was like, ‘Dude, I feel really weird…’ But I was fine. It’s hard not to think the worst. It’s hard to think you’re overtired, or you’ve been on Instagram too long, and to realise these might have the same side-effects as something deadly. But the charity evolves with me. I use it. Here’s something else that I feel: maybe someone else feels the same way.”She talks about the summer just gone with a regretful kind of wonder – it was th e summer after the Game of Thrones finale had ided fans, when she was coming to terms with how the “overwhelming” amount of nudity in the first season had affected her. And, after years of “filling every hiatus with a movie, shit, good or otherwise” (she starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Genisys, and as Qi’ra in Solo: a Star Wars Story) she had decided to take a break. Or, the decision was made for her.All this is recent. All this is really recent, with a new understanding of grief. Her beloved father, a theatre sound engineer, died of cancer in 2016. “The world felt like a scarier place once my dad wasn’t in it,” she said at the time. “There was the referendum, too,” she shudders. “It was the year of everything bad.”But it was after her lost summer that, “I finally got this feeling. As if, on a cellular level, I’d grown up. And it’s so bittersweet, because I was clinging on to that childlike optimism. Then, when I finally let it go, I realised that was actually quite a heavy backpack to be wearing. I felt like that at the Emmys, too, finally popping my head up from the bunker. It’s as if you can see the actual landscape that you’ve been living in this entire time from another perspective.”Occasionally she looks at me apologetically, her eyebrows like arrows, to check she’s not saying too much, and then she continues. “It can be perceived as such a feminine trait, can’t it – the responsibility to ‘put a smile on it’. And, and you feel like it’s a defeat if you give in and admit, ‘Maybe it’s not going to be OK in the end.’ But then, if you do, then you have an opportunity to go… ‘and what if that’s all right?’ Death is shit,” she says, dramatically. “It’s really hard and grief is horrific, and yet it is completely and utterly guaranteed. No matter how much Silicon Valley boys want to prove to everyone it’s not. But the finality of death, the absolute certainty of it, I’ve realised, is such a tonic.”Along with a good stroke, I add the loss of a parent to her list of recommendations. “No! I’m not recommending it to anyone, obviously. But it is something real you can actually hold on to. We don’t look at grief properly. I’m not talking about the random moments of completely overwhelming emotion, I’m pretty in control of that… there was only one time on set where I just physically couldn’t stop crying. It’s the other stuff that we don’t discuss – the functional grief when your worldview and your perspective on life and yourself changes irrevocably, forever.”How is she dealing with that? “By realising that there is a framework that life lives within, and knowing when you reach the edges of it. There’s that. And I try to use the shit feelings as opposed to just ‘breathing through it’. It’s like putting my plastic in the recycling bin – it might not do anything, but I should at least try. And then being an actor and having a production company, knowing that the greater understanding I have about life, the greater storyteller I can be. As an actor, you’re always observing – no matter what trauma you’re going through, there’s a wee bit of your brain that’s like, ‘Isn’t this fascinating?’”Every time I interview a famous person I leave feeling slightly high and slightly sad, because to enter their fabulous world also, inevitably, means you see the shadow of their cage. The imposed disconnect, for instance. And the constant smiling and the many locks. Clarke was catapulted to extreme fame during a period when she nearly lost her mind. She started to find gifts outside her door, from one of many stalkers. One, she says, is extremely unwell, another extremely mean. “The stalker stuff is just horrible because, as a single lady walking around town, I already feel like I’m being followed.”These stalkers believe they’re having a relationship with her, “which is confusing, because having a relationship with people I don’t know is a big part of what I signed up for. I care about what art does to people. But it carries with it a responsibility, and when you leave your front door you take that with you. And it’s a difficult path to navigate. Because sometimes,” and she’s talking about fans now, the line between the two often being blurred, “you get grabbed physically and your instincts kick in. When you see shock being registered on someone else’s face, you’re like, ‘Where’s the danger?’ And then you realise, oh, it’s me – I’m the danger.”Her fanbase is due to change shortly, as she maps out her career without dragons. Clarke’s new film is Last Christmas and is based on the Wham! song. While it is a box-office hit, reviews have been… mixed. “The kind of bad,” said Rolling Stone, “that falls somewhere between finding a lump of coal in your stocking and discovering one painfully lodged in your rectum.” It threatens to become a cult classic. Reader, I loved it.Clarke plays a woman whose messy life, it becomes clear, is partly a result of recent illness. “I was able,” she says darkly, “to bring a lot to the role.” There is a romantic twist, a twist so gooey it may cause diabetes in vulnerable audiences, but there is a second twist, in that this film (co-written by Emma Thompson) could prove to be the most effective piece of anti-Brexit propaganda of the festive season. Clarke (with Thompson as her mother) plays the youngest of a family of first-generation immigrants, dealing with the fallout of the referendum.“We filmed a scene of a hate crime,” Clarke says, a scene on a London bus where a couple are told to go back to where they came from. “And Emma said, ‘Come on, let’s be honest: haven’t we all witnessed something similar?’” She loved working on this film, in part because of the women in charge, “who recognised that we all had a life outside this movie. You don’t have to have a vagina to do that, but the difference lay in that slight... lack of patriarchy?” And in part because of the intersection between entertainment and what she describes as “meaning”. Something she continues to search for, albeit with regular disclaimers of privilege, and embarrassment.“The world is scary at the moment, both politically and environmentally. You have politicians pushing people to the absolute limits of their left versus right parameters, and the middle ground that we were all living in before is now wasteland, because both sides are life or death. It feels so much more polarised and extreme than ever. You’ve got 33-year-olds like me asking, ‘Should I bring kids into this world? If I do, what will that kid feel like?’ It feels frightening, consistently. And I’m not alone. I’m leaning hard on Bake Off right now.”But the fear has made her reassess her work, post-Game of Thrones. “Entertainment is about taking you outside of yourself for a second, which is largely what I think the success of Game of Thrones was. People wanted to see something familiar, but also have that level of separation, through dragons and magic. Escapism is what lots of people go to art for. So, if we can cherry-pick stories to tell people in a shitty time, I’d like to give them something really good. It could make them feel better, or less alone, or make them realise there’s something outside of their front door that they should care about.”She takes a sharp breath. “You know, I spent a lot of time being like, ‘What I do is all bullshit. I’m completely selfish, a total narcissist.’ And then…” And then the world hit her at a great speed, and she emerged into this new adulthood, and 10 years crawled over her like glittering rats. “And then I realised what it was for. I help provide relief. And that’s worth something, especially now. Right?”It takes a second before I realise she is waiting for an answer. “Right,” I say, reassuringly. “Right.”Last Christmas is in cinemas nationwide nowStylist Hope Lawrie makeup by Lynsey Alexander at Streeters using Lancôme hair by Ken O’Rourke at Premier Hair and Makeup using Charles Worthington Volume \u0026amp Bounce Body Booster Mousse shot at Chesterton Road at beachstudios"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1302923db01cdfeeff54327cea018108283ac85/0_0_4570_2741/master/4570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=434d4d78ff96eb09493e9bcfb8405316","title":"declutter so you can reclutter kondo has a new master plan","story":"Now we’ve got rid of all our old books and photos (unless they ‘sparked joy’), it’s time to buy some lovely octagonal platesMy friends online will be familiar with the phrase “late-stage capitalism” and its associated examples, including Tesco’s festive mulled wine-scented toilet paper (delightful) and the mammoth black iPhone advertising hoardings (less so) installed over the windows of low-income flats in east London – the landlord had sold their tenants’ daylight.It is one of those useful phrases that encompasses the discomfort and farce of modern life, at a time when inequality rises like sea levels, competition is sewn into everyday life, stability and security in work are fairy tales, yet the handful of corporations that control the textures of our life play our political fears back to us in jingles, co-opting politics to sell us Pepsi. On my desk I have packages containing 1 x “empowering” sheet-mask for the vulva, another containing a £50 eco-friendly water bottle that jangles with “cleansing crystals” and, stuck in a notebook, a photo ripped from a magazine of a pair of jeans that came ready-muddied, to show its wearer can “get down and dirty”, £350. Here we are, broken.The phrase was originally used by Marxist theorists in the 20th century, but popularised online about two years ago, with thousands of memes and Reddit posts competing to share examples of feverish marketing attempts and evidence of pitiless choices by those controlling the cash. And so it was this phrase that rolled, marble-like into my mind when I was sent news of Marie Kondo’s new online shop. Yes, this is the same Marie Kondo whose 2015 book on decluttering I read closely, like many others, in order to improve my life, and whose international success led to a Netflix show and status as a celebrity tidying consultant, and a doubling of contributions to charity shops across the world.By inviting us to hold each of our shirts, each of our books, our photographs, the small chipped heirlooms of past relationships in our hands and asking us to keep it only if it “sparked joy”, she ushered in the possibility of pure control. While not inherently minimalist (a trigger word for me, a person who, after half a glass of wine will happily burn down the superiority that comes with a “capsule wardrobe” and expensive asceticism) her teachings leaned heavily towards the “stuff is bad bin all your crap” school of thought.Still, it should be no surprise that as 2019 crawls bloodily to a close, whispering hoarsely to the year ahead, “Leave me behind, I’ll only slow you down”, that a Kondo shop, selling new crap to those whose homes echo nakedly since she first entered their lives, should open. And right before Christmas, too.This is Kondo II: Back in the Habit, where she reveals the masterplan, her very own economy, a cycle of buying and binning in search of true happiness. The shop itself is Goop-like in its ambitions of expensive wellness, with joy-sparking products, such as a crumb brush ($24), 4,096hz tuning fork with smoky quartz crystal ($75) and “computer brush” ($35). There are five different sizes of octagonal plates to organise your emptinesses. The sponge ($16) and tea scoop ($54) are already out of stock, some gentle mums surely due, on Boxing Day, to quietly ask their offspring if they kept the receipts.Late-stage capitalism sits in these colourful octagonal plates, smiling its thin grin. There is something reassuring, though, about the predictability of a tidying guru asking you to clear just enough space to house a range of her own branded products.Elsewhere, across a single day, I watch “clean eating” influencers sell cookery books passing on diet advice gleaned from a lifetime of eating disorders, monetising guilt and shame and adorable little energy balls. On the train I stare at an ad from property developers for new-builds in Wembley using language and a logo inspired by Extinction Rebellion to market their “hotel-inspired service” for renting millennials. I write this as culture secretary Nicky Morgan defends the Conservative pledge to deliver 50,000 more nurses by offering, I think, the fact that if you’re a nurse, then if we vote the Tories in again, next year you’ll be two nurses? Maths is hard.And yet, beyond the reassuring awfulness, there is potential for change. It’s in the fact that there is a phrase for it, that this bruising feeling is so universal and ominous it can be packaged in sarcastic memes, named, dissected. The fact that the phrase contains the word “late”, as in, nearing the end. Is a revolution coming?Such optimism is new for me, a person more used to sifting through a pastel-coloured website at 3am muttering ragefully when I wake having hate-purchased a $16 sponge. Therefore I am more inclined to keep monitoring these examples of late-stage capitalism in my small notebook, awaiting the day Apple or Amazon co-opt the phrase, printing it on a billboard pasted across the windows of an inner-city tower block. In its own starless way, such horror may spark joy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c072c4ece223dc8fb0c0dd64746c1530ead8b37f/0_87_5256_3153/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b714847623016c33d0984fb8969e08","title":"how to treat a fungal nail infection","story":"Nail fungus is never an easy subject to broach. It can be very limiting for sufferers as it can cause embarrassment and discomfort. Noticeable symptoms include yellow or brown discolouration of the nail that will not go away on its own, while crumbly nails can break off. A musty smell can occur, too.If the infection spreads to the area between toes, it is commonly called athlete’s foot, a condition that is contagious and easily spread by walking barefoot.There are simple precautions you can take to prevent getting an infection or passing one on. These include wearing socks when you try on shoes in shops, and wearing pool shoes or flip-flops up to the edge of a swimming pool and in the changing rooms and shower at the gym. Most importantly, dry your feet thoroughly after bathing, including between the toes to prevent soggy skin. And don’t share towels with your family members. If you do have an infection, use a separate towel for your feet to stop it spreading.Nail fungus is usually easiest to treat when it hasn’t gone to the root of the nail. Over-the-counter medicated treatments are usually only licensed to be used on infections that are in the top half of the nail. Many of the products sold for fungal nails are not actually medicated, but instead provide a preventative barrier for healthy nails against fungus or alter an infected nail to cause an improvement in its appearance, but do not actually kill the spores.

My son and his partner have jobs and we agreed to care for her one day each week. We have found, to our shame, that we’ve come to dread these days. We both still work freelance and the arrangement frequently interferes with this and other activities. We try to make the day fun, but I find it an exhausting chore. I also feel resentful over silly things, such as the inability of the parents to provide a change of clothes or food, etc. To an extent we feel taken for granted. My instinct is to explain we underestimated the task and suggest a new arrangement. Or we could find a childminder to take our granddaughter for a couple of hours that, of course, would require permission and would probably not be met with enthusiasm. We want to play a big part in our granddaughter’s life, but we’d be happier if this was done in circumstances more suited to our lifestyle. Is that really so bad or abnormal?Mariella replies First, thank you – on behalf of every working parent blessed with healthy grandparents prepared to assist in lightening the load of childcare. I’d also like to thank you on behalf of the government, as I’m sure they haven’t been in touch. Our current incumbents are the latest in a long line of elected representatives who’ve failed to come up with proper funding for childcare and have instead taken advantage of grandparents to the tune of £22.5bn donated to our economy through their babysitting efforts. That’s just one of the astounding figures I came across recently while helping to launch a manifesto for Insuring Women’s Futures, a voluntary organisation highlighting mind-boggling statistics on how women, in particular, are impacted fiscally by their caring duties, among other financial obstacles.My own parents-in-law made so many things possible for us that I am eternally in their debt. In their early 70s they took on not one but two toddlers with only 13 months between them, for weekends and even an entire week here and there, making work and precious downtime as a couple an available option.It’s not just free babysitting that grandparents provide, but the reassurance that your kids are with adults who love them as much as you do. Friends without such back-up never fail to point out to me how lucky I’ve been. So, I hope you realise how valuable you grandparents are, particularly for the many for whom regular childcare remains – outrageously – an unaffordable luxury.For your efforts you should be swept along on a sea of gratitude and certainly shouldn’t be feeling taken for granted or ashamed. Anyone who’s looked after a toddler knows it’s no easy task. If it weren’t for family members like you, so many parents (and women particularly) would be forced to leave their jobs or to work part-time, with a knock-on effect on family budgets, mental and physical wellbeing, and the economy as a whole.We’re all familiar with the notion of the squeezed middle: those whose children are not yet independent and whose parents are becoming less so. Perhaps we don’t give enough thought to the likes of you and your wife, struggling to maintain a decent lifestyle while being forced back into a role you thought you’d long completed. That said, at present, you are both healthy and active, but as your child now reaches out to you for assistance, one day you may be the ones needing their support. Don’t bite the hand you may need to ask to feed you.You are under no obligation to take on this onerous duty. But time moves on at speed and very soon these days of exhaustive effort on the caring front will be far behind you. In that not-distant future, you’ll hopefully be rewarded for today’s efforts by a rich bond with your maturing granddaughter and be integral to her life, rather than simply being distant members of her extended family. Your indignation does seem particularly raw. Is the issue less about caring for your grandchild and more about the absence of gratitude? I’m sensing the latter and wondering if you need to lay down some guidelines.Obviously, the answer is to talk and agree a way forward that works better for you. But don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. For all the reasons I’ve given I’d be tempted to reach a compromise. The suggestion of a two-hour childcare session could work, though hardly seems worth the reverberations it may cause. If a whole day is too much for you, why not instead offer two halves, which you won’t find so onerous and still reduces their childcare costs?Most importantly, I think you need to reset expectations and feel no compunction in asking for the practical things that would make the task easier, including support on the basics you mention. Being taken for granted is never pleasant, but neither is it worth going to war over. You are free to do as you like with your time, but don’t forget that, even in terms of self-interest, those in need today may well be your saviours further down the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a7ffdd311767e8fadd0811ccb623c1a33743bf/0_275_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1661fb0745fab959eeef6cdfbd2f164a","title":"i thought that family was best avoided until i had children of my own","story":"I had grown up with the fairly unshakable conviction that relatives were irretrievably problematic things, and that, in general, they were best avoided. I had good reason to think this way. My grandmother had an awkward relationship with her mother, just as my mother endured a difficult relationship with her. My parents were spectacularly mismatched but stayed married – against my grandparents’ gloomy predictions – for a full 10 years before going their separate ways. After they split, my relationship with my younger brother dutifully headed in a similar direction: eternal enmity. We grew stealthily into polar opposites and our adolescent issues didn’t mellow with age. The last we saw of one another was at our mother’s funeral, 20 years ago.Hardly surprising, then, that I never much wanted to start a family myself, convinced that I wasn’t up to it. An absent father does not prime you for becoming an engaged one.When my future wife told me, on our third date, that she didn’t want children, I almost married her on the spot. But after a dozen years together, biology, circumstance and lingering whim conspired to change her opinion, and she then worked diligently to change mine, patiently explaining that I didn’t have to perpetuate the circle of familial dysfunction together, we could change it, and make ours better. Her reasoning was entirely sound. Ours was a happy union – my grandparents approved – and she had a confidence in me that I didn’t quite yet possess myself.And so, in early 2004, we took the plunge and threw ourselves open to fate. A mere 13 months later, one week shy of a doctor’s appointment to test the increasing probability that I was firing blanks, a blue line appeared where there had previously been none. I was thrilled, and relieved. I was also absolutely terrified. I remained twitchy throughout the pregnancy, fearful a baby would expose in me a pair of great clunking achilles heels. I read books on the subject – not hectoring self-help titles but, rather, brave, unflinching memoirs from writers such as Anne Enright and Rachel Cusk, whose combined message, as I interpreted it, was that I was right to panic.The learning curve, when it came, was bewildering. Such ruction from so small a person such flagrant disregard for bedtime. There were tears from each of us, but gradually I learned that fearing something so much actually prepares you for it all the more. It builds confidence, an inner steel, and once that’s established you become, if not quite adept, then at least increasingly fit for purpose. Cusk was right: it changes everything, but not necessarily for the worse. Starting a family didn’t drive us apart it knitted us together. And, thus emboldened, we repeated the process two years later. Somewhere in the middle of all that, we got married, because why not?My daughters are now 13 and 11. They have brought noise and chaos into our lives – the kitchen hasn’t been properly clean in a decade, and I can never find my keys – but I marvel at their existence, and the fact that I haven’t yet made a mess of things. I didn’t run away, and they don’t hate one another. We are an actual, functioning unit. We’re good.My working day is generally interrupted each afternoon at 3pm. Successive, post-school texts arrive, asking if they can bring friends round, if they can stay out, whether there are any prawn cocktail crisps left. An hour later, they’re home, the younger one demanding immediate access to my computer in order to watch YouTube the older one accusing me of finishing the Nutella. They hog my wife when she gets back from work, then conspicuously give us both a wide berth in pursuit of their own respective screen time, bedroom doors firmly closed, do not disturb, enter at your own risk.I can still see why I thought having a family seemed so unsettling. Ever since their arrival, life has become comprehensively more complicated, more convoluted and far more expensive. The house is crowded with competing opinions, raised voices and withering teenage sarcasm. They confuse me, exasperate me, make me laugh and, occasionally, particularly on birthdays when they write cards with their careful handwriting, make me cry. They are utterly self-obsessed and astonishingly lovely. They ask so many questions and never like the answer. I couldn’t imagine my world without them. Families, I’ve come to learn, don’t have to be knotty and dysfunctional but can actually be a harmonious place in which to dwell – a realisation that has brought comfort and relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8abd615d318ec1ffc2ac940f2e304b8944de035/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=700\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=max\u0026s=e8b9823162bbad88e46e313222d83bcc","title":"hermes couriers delivery exclusions insurance claim","story":"When Keith Fletcher sold a set of football cards on eBay he chose delivery by Hermes, buying insurance online in the process. The package was never seen again and tracking suggested it had never left the drop-off point. But Hermes refused to compensate him. It declared that the item was “memorabilia”, and thus excluded for compensation under its terms and conditions.“I’d checked the list of exclusions and couldn’t find any reason for these cards not being covered,” says Fletcher. “It defines memorabilia as ‘photographs, signed items and vinyl’. How could anyone know kids’ football cards are included?”Hermes backed down following intervention by the Observer and revealed that its staff had been similarly bewildered by the vagueness of its exclusions. The company admitted it had confused “memorabilia” with “collectables”, which are covered, and paid out the £90 Fletcher had to refund the buyer.He is one of several Observer readers to have been left out of pocket when insured goods went missing in transit. Delivery companies absolve themselves of liability with long lists of prohibited and restricted items, some so ill-defined that those who do trouble to read them can’t know if their package is included or not.Banned goods include obvious items such as explosives and “human flesh”, but also some unexpected things. Yodel, for instance, refuses to deliver fur-trimmed clothes, costume jewellery or mobile phones.Confectionery, clocks, cheques and “personal items” are prohibited by DPD, while TNT forbids 123 categories – from aftershave to wheels – and refuses to pay for the loss or damage of 63 more, such as chocolate and posters. None of the major players will carry liquids, pastes or gel in any form.It appears that to keep costs down, couriers exempt anything remotely likely to suffer through manhandling, along with hazardous cargo. While customers might accept that fragile items are more susceptible to damage, there’s no reason why they should be more liable to getting lost.“There is no greater risk of losing a football than losing football cards,” says Fletcher. “Hermes was negligent in losing the item, misleading in using vague undefined terms in its insurance exclusions, and dishonest in taking money for insurance on excluded items.”Whereas DPD and TNT flag up goods that are noncompliant as soon as they are specified on their order forms, Hermes allows customers to book delivery and offers insurance cover for a prohibited and restricted item, even though they are required to describe the contents of the package on the order form.Small print tucked discreetly at the bottom of the web page merely advises “there are a few items we can’t carry” and invites customers to click through to two lengthy lists, including baffling catch-alls such as “composite items of any description”, “plant derivatives” and “items that can be exchanged by themselves or with any other item, for money, goods or services”.Stewart Monks was caught out when he used Hermes to deliver a £169 pair of binoculars. The firm informed him that the parcel had been lost, but that the insurance was invalid because items containing glass are excluded from cover. “I would accept breakage of glass is a reasonable risk,” he says. “But how does that affect them being lost?”The binoculars, in any case, had plastic lenses, a fact Hermes only conceded when the Observer intervened. The company apologised for the “misunderstanding and inconvenience” and finally paid out.Critics suspect that firms such as Hermes, which use shops as drop-off points, are using insurance exemptions to dodge liability for theft and loss due to inadequate security.EBay seller Martin Toll used Hermes to send a £270 camera lens but it was never even logged as leaving the drop-off point in a Londis store.“The pile of parcels for collection by the courier regularly extends some three metres beyond the counter in front of the wine shelves,” he says. “Any small parcel is vulnerable. The day I dropped off my parcel, there was just one young man at the counter serving parcels and general customers. Not a secure arrangement.”Three weeks after he dispatched the item, Hermes confirmed it had been lost, but said he was not entitled to compensation because it contained glass elements. “Nowhere on its list of exclusions was photographic equipment mentioned,” he says. “It isn’t as if I sent something fragile and it arrived broken. The parcel appears not to have left the shop premises.” Hermes, which now specifies cameras and lenses as excluded items, eventually refunded the £270 as a “goodwill gesture” after the Observer got involved, and ordered the Londis branch to improve security.“Our team makes regular scheduled visits to every ParcelShop to review all aspects of the operation, which includes security and storage,” it says. “Our strict criteria state all parcels should be placed in a secure area away from the general public. Any internal or external reports of noncompliance are addressed immediately. As a result of Mr Toll’s allegations we visited this ParcelShop to reiterate the way parcels were stored is not acceptable. We will continue to review the situation.”DHL also fails to alert customers who enter a prohibited item on their order. Its website unquestioningly accepted my dummy booking for narcotics worth £2,000 and offered insurance for £30. A “Prohibited Items” tab in grey print next to the description box is the only clue I’d be wasting my money. The invitation to check a list is on another part of the page.DHL says: “Customers can view prohibited items at several points in the booking process. Prior to payment, the customer has to select a declaration to confirm the shipment does not contain any of the items listed. We’re always looking to ensure customers understand the terms.”Fletcher, Monk and Toll all paid the price for ruthless cost-cutting that allows courier firms to undercut rivals. Sending a 500g package via Hermes’ next-day delivery is £2.85 compared with £14.88 at Parcelforce, which has minimal restrictions, more generous insurance and flags up any order included in its prohibited items.Complaints about insurance sold by delivery firms has soared, according to Martyn James of complaints website Resolver. “We’ve seen 2,087 cases in a year,” he says. “The terms of these policies are often horrendous and it’s hard to see how they might ever pay out in some circumstances. You may as well stick a fiver on the package and hope for the best.”Yodel told the Observer it prohibited items to “minimise risk”. DPD explained it was to protect customers from the consequences of their own poor packaging skills. “We know that if certain goods are incorrectly packaged, there is a higher possibility of damage or loss,” it says.Hermes says it is reviewing its policy of excluding listed items from cover if they are lost or damaged.“We do assess this on a case-by-case basis,” it says. “In the meantime our advice remains to carefully read the excluded list at the point of order.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cb4e5c5b17394e4b3319872121a2950a617fad/0_199_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c57b01c8a17fa2593a59ac2273e453","title":"are things going wrong with the uk beloved dr martens brand","story":"Readers accuse the firm of falling standards after private equity buyout and shift in productionIt was just a small question in our regular Consumer Champions column. Why, a reader asked, had her £170 Dr Martens boots fallen apart after just six months? The response was huge, with readers accusing the bootmaker of sacrificing quality, offshoring production and chasing profits under the ownership of a London-based private equity company a long way from its roots in Northamptonshire.So has there really been a decline in quality? Many  readers think so. One sent us pictures of her poorly stitched boots. “I bought the limited edition Lazy Oaf X boots for £180, two out of the three boots we ordered have broken! I have previous pairs of Dr Martens which have lasted me five-plus years so I know I haven’t ‘worn them out’.”Another reader, CH, says: “I purchased cherry red shoes and within eight months the sole was coming away from the shoe. Sadly Dr M’s workmanship and quality is not as good as it once was.”QBC from London wrote to Dr Martens, alleging: “Your production standards have dropped. The previous pair had a moulded insole that could be removed from the boot and fitted perfectly right into the toe of the boot. The replacement pair has a glued-in flat-foam insole which leaves a gap between it and the inside of the boot. Not only that but the leather that comprises the tongue is 0.2mm thinner – 1.4mm compared to 1.6mm of the previous pair.”The chief operating officer, Geert Peeters, says the shoes are still all welted, the leather has not changed and production standards have not slipped. The materials suppliers have not changed for decades and there is stringent quality control, the company says. It denies that the leather is thinner, and says shoe construction remains the same as on 1 April 1960, the day the 1460 boot was named and first made.Not true, says Dr Martens. The shift to Asia was in 2004, so it’s by no means a recent development. It says the production methods used in its Asian factories are identical to those at its base in England, and that you could pick up an operator in one of its Asia factories and shift them to England, and all the processes would be exactly the same “all the way down to putting the lid on the box”.Other critics say it is not China that’s the problem, but its new owners. Dr Martens is now owned by Permira, a £30bn group headquartered in Pall Mall, London, which bought it in 2013 from the Griggs family for £300m.“The stitching came apart on my slip-on boots. Take a brand, hand it over to venture capitalists, who then slash costs and pimp image,” was the view of one reader.Critics of private equity firms say they typically make deep cuts to jobs and operating costs then sell the business off five or six years later for a quick profit. Indeed, one Labour MP said in 2007 it was a “national scandal that the casino capitalists from global private equity groups are allowed to treat British workers and some of our biggest companies as nothing more than pawns in a game of get rich quick”. Those were the words of John McDonnell, then a lowly backbench MP who no one thought might one day be a serious contender to become chancellor of the exchequer.Yet what is also apparent from the response to our story is how many readers were recommending a brand called Solovair instead. Its shoes are strikingly similar to Dr Martens, and they are all made in England. The company made Dr Martens shoes under licence for 35 years. “We’ve been around since 1881 in Northamptonshire, and in 2006 were bought out by a local person who saved the company and kept all 60 employees in their jobs. We’re still very small compared with Dr Martens, but we’re growing fast.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560746687a954ab1fed949901f3ef8806b34d9cb/0_765_4969_2981/master/4969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1894fd0c21443bd27e34a69766ef403e","title":"jamie barton review wigmore hall london kathleen kelly","story":"Wigmore Hall, LondonThe mezzo-soprano, accompanied by pianist Kathleen Kelly, radiated easy confidence owing to her superb vocal controlJamie Barton is a star – still rising, but already a proper, bona fide star. Audiences hold her in fierce affection, partly inspired by her glowingly defiant stage presence, something everyone got to see during her Pride flag-waving performance at this summer’s Last Night of the Proms. More than that, though, there’s her voice, the kind of sumptuous velvet-and-steel mezzo-soprano that fills an auditorium seemingly as easily as opening the mouth, used with sharp intelligence.This programme of songs, featuring more female composers than male, turned up some gems, starting with Elinor Remick Warren’s piece Heather, Barton’s voice tracing smooth, easy sweeps over Kathleen Kelly’s rippling piano. Framing some slightly overwrought works by Amy Beach were one song each from the Boulanger sisters, Lili and Nadia. The muted colours and French vowels of Lili’s Attente drew a darker tone from Barton, who crowned the piece with a high note that sounded aptly vulnerable, yet absolutely controlled.In Haydn’s Arianna a Naxos, the most substantial and serious work, Barton scaled back in a way that made her haunting cries after Theseus stand out more, not to mention the accusations she hurled at the end. Perhaps, in this, one could have wished for sharper definition from Kelly but her virtuosity in Libby Larsen’s Love After 1950, taking in boogie-woogie, blues and Spanish habanera, left no such doubts.Barton and Kelly really sold us these five songs, tracing a woman’s journey towards self-acceptance in a sardonic, entertaining cycle that plays with profundity but doesn’t commit. There was a cheeky drinking song by Ravel and a moment of intensity from Henri Duparc, before Barton finally unleashed the full radiance of her unfettered high notes in Richard Strauss’s Cäcilie. That there was only one encore would have been disappointing had it not been Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Barton owned: rapt, focused, and singing with just the right amount of rhythmic leeway for her kind of voice. Most singers spend a whole career trying to hit this balance of vocal poise and easy confidence with their audience, and reach it only when the voice is going off the boil. But not Barton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6801197fef5ce723afdcfc4533f8ab18e8ff5fc3/0_0_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c1119013e3e03f9dfc14daddf0dc4f","title":"election 2019 shifting identities in peterborough podcast","story":"Robert Booth on the battle for Peterborough, one of the key swing seats set to determine the election.

He will say that Britain risks being “tied to Donald Trump’s coat-tails” and US foreign policy under Boris Johnson.His comments come just before Johnson hosts a Nato summit this week to be attended by the US president. Responding to the London Bridge attack in a speech in York, Corbyn will praise the “extraordinary bravery” of the public in confronting the attacker. He will say that the police were right to use lethal force, with lives at stake and the attacker wearing a fake suicide vest.However, he will also say that while responsibility for acts of terror lies with “the terrorists, their funders and recruiters”, UK leaders “have made the wrong calls on our security”.He will add: “The threat of terrorism cannot and should not be reduced to questions of foreign policy alone. But too often the actions of successive governments have fuelled, not reduced that threat.“Sixteen years ago, I warned against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I said it would set off a spiral of conflict, hate, misery and desperation that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism and the misery of future generations. It did, and we are still living with the consequences today.“The war on terror has manifestly failed. Britain’s repeated military interventions in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have exacerbated, rather than resolved the problems.”Corbyn will criticise cuts and warn that real security cannot be done “on the cheap”. His comments come as the prime minister announces that he will conduct the most wide-ranging review of Britain’s security, defence and foreign policy since the end of the cold war if the Tories win the general election. No 10 revealed the plan after Friday’s London Bridge terror attack, in which two members of the public were killed and three taken to hospital for their injuries. However, Corbyn will argue today: “Take the probation service, part-privatised in 2014, resulting in disaster. The most serious cases stayed in a justice system badly undermined by austerity. A failure to recruit has left huge staffing shortfalls and with staff supervising more cases than ever expected, posing a serious risk to our security.”Johnson said that the examination of the UK’s security capabilities would be bigger than previous reviews as it would cover not just the armed forces but also intelligence, counter-terrorism and serious and organised crime. The prime minister suggested it would also review strategic and diplomatic issues, such as Britain’s place in the world after Brexit. Johnson said: “It will also consider global Britain’s foreign policy: British alliances and diplomacy shifts of power and wealth to Asia how we can best use our huge expenditure on international development and the role of technology.”Johnson insisted that despite Brexit the UK would want to strengthen cooperation with European Union nations on security, notwithstanding warnings from many EU leaders that Brexit will reduce UK involvement in organisations such as Europol and jeopardise access to its vital databases.Senior Tories are anxious that Trump, who, during his two-day visit, is expected to face protests from NHS staff fearful that the service will be at risk in a UK-US trade deal, may seek to intervene in the UK election campaign in a way that could backfire on the Conservatives.Trump is expected to be greeted on Tuesday evening outside Buckingham Palace by doctors, nurses and other NHS workers leading a protest of tens of thousands. They are planning to march from Trafalgar Square to Canada Gate when Trump and other Nato leaders meet the Queen at a 6pm drinks reception.Last night 515 NHS nurses, doctors and other health professionals wrote an open letter to Trump demanding a guarantee that the NHS will not be targeted in any UK-US trade talks.“We are particularly concerned about conversations over patents for pharmaceuticals and the potential for huge drug price increases for the NHS,” the letter says.“To allay our worst fears, we request you publish new trade negotiating objectives that explicitly rule out any measures that will lead to changes to our pharmaceutical patent and procurement regime, explicitly state that the NHS is taken off the negotiating table.“Anything less than this will not reassure us and will leave thousands of dedicated NHS staff in fear for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b35a74440f1ed52fedaf74672732d255740394e/0_160_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ac7061b3643fd06e9eec79ba5f3ff0","title":"lib dems suspend campaigner over apparent email forgery","story":"Party had sought retraction of journalist’s story about alleged sale of voter dataThe Liberal Democrats have suspended a senior member of their campaign team just days before polling day, after an official apparently forged emails to support a legal threat against a journalist over an embarrassing story.Jo Swinson’s party has been fighting the website openDemocracy for weeks over a little-noticed article published last month about the party allegedly selling voter data to the remain campaign for £100,000 during the EU referendum.As part of an attempt to have the story substantially retracted, the Liberal Democrats claimed openDemocracy failed to follow standard journalistic practice and ignored a denial from the party which had been emailed in advance of publication.But openDemocracy said it had checked its records and no such email had ever been received.The party’s lawyers provided a screengrab of the supposed communication. The Lib Dems held this up as conclusive evidence that openDemocracy had engaged in journalistic malpractice and demanded a prominent written apology.However, openDemocracy noticed something was amiss. It pointed out the screengrab of the supposed email from the Lib Dem official was dated 4.39pm on 12 November – the day before its journalist had approached the party for comment.The investigative news website asked how it was possible that the Lib Dems were claiming to have documentary evidence of a party official sending a response 18 hours before the original question had been asked.After several days of silence, the Lib Dems retracted the email and said an employee had been suspended pending an investigation into the provision of false information.A party spokesperson said it continued to deny the original allegations about data misuse made by openDemocracy. They added: “However, we have been made aware that the information openDemocracy subsequently received from the Liberal Democrats was incorrect. We have suspended a member of staff involved and are following due process.”The party has been vocal in its criticism of “fake news” during the election campaign, despite coming under fire for the use of dubious bar charts and confusingly labelled campaign material that looked like local newspapers.Mary Fitzgerald, the editor of openDemocracy, said there were many more important political issues “than an amateur forgery from the press office of a party that has no chance of winning the next election”.“But given how prolific Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats have been in calling out the scourge of fake news during this election campaign, it’s worth noting how busy they’ve been creating it themselves.”The row has also focused attention on the original story, by openDemocracy reporter James Cusick, which claimed to have seen internal party documents, regarding the decision to sell the data. Many leave-supporting groups, including Arron Banks’s Leave.EU have already been fined over data misuse during the EU referendum but there has been less scrutiny of the activities of the remain campaign.The Lib Dems strongly deny any wrongdoing regarding the data sale, insisting it simply provided a version of the electoral roll. However, the information commissioner is continuing to investigate the 2016 transaction.Fitzgerald said the heavy-handed response from the Lib Dems raised further questions: “If, as they strongly maintain, the party had acted in accordance with the law at all times and had done nothing wrong, why did someone think it was important enough to repeatedly make false claims, including a faked document, via expensive lawyers?“The distraction has cost us valuable staff time and legal bills, which could otherwise have been spent on doing more actual journalism during the final weeks before the most important election in a generation.“That’s what’s so cynical about hiring expensive lawyers to chase down small, non-profit media outlets like ours. We stand by our story. They’ve offered no apology, let alone an offer to cover costs, for the time and money they’ve wasted. “We’ve come to expect this behaviour from corrupt oligarchs and from bullying, vain businessmen. Perhaps I was naive, but I did not expect it from Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a626b61ab04234750c98bcf03940d4da70e8453/171_404_6281_3769/master/6281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c957ae249cda3dc73dcd922d9c8e24","title":"on road with jeremy corbyn a photo essay","story":"As the Labour leader fights his second general election,  photographer  Sean Smith joins the campaign trailI started photographing Jeremy Corbyn during the leadership contest before the 2015 election. After a short time covering him on the campaign trail, I thought he would do a lot better then people expected. By the time of the next general election, in 2017, I, probably in a minority of one, thought he could win.Corbyn is quite relaxed with a camera around. When we first met, he would ask: “What do you want? What should I do?” But now he understands I’m not trying to do photocall pictures I want it to be as if I wasn’t there.To start with I didn’t have much special access, but over time I persistently asked to follow him. I don’t think the Labour team ever started to trust me, but they did start to tolerate me.I wasn’t expecting him to do the Eric Morecambe pose. I didn’t suggest it. A member of the public asked to do one with him and then he got Lizzi to do one, too. It was very spontaneous.Corbyn is much more relaxed and open than his minders from the press team. He said to me once, “Oh Sean, are you coming on the train with me?” and suddenly all of his people looked worried I could see them thinking, “Oh no, don’t invite him – what are you doing?”He seems very happy and rejuvenated when he’s on the road and appears to prefer it to being in Westminster: I think he feels it’s a bit of a club, an echo chamber. On the road, he seems genuinely engaged, albeit mostly with Labour party members. Perhaps he should go after a few Tories, too.He’s got more energy than I do. I was with him in Hartlepool one day, back in Islington the next: he couldn’t resist popping into a tiny local street festival where there was an Elvis impersonator. Everyone there wanted to say hello to him, even the police officers. When he’s preparing a speech, he does very brief notes to himself. It seems like he’s writing prompts. In Tolpuddle, he was making his notes in a porch behind the stage, where a musician had left a guitar.I think Corbyn is the only politician I’ve photographed who doesn’t have that lifelong ambition to be prime minister. I’ve never come across anyone like that. All the others, even if there is no possibility of it happening, have that occasional glint in their eye at the thought of “what if?”. For him, agree with him or not, it is all about the policies he deeply believes in it is not about personal ambition. I think even his enemies would agree with that.I think he’s a lot more steely and capable than people think. From the little work I’ve done with Boris Johnson, he’s more desperate to be loved than Corbyn the prime minister seems to get hurt if people don’t like him.It’s become harder to get proper time with politicians. Margaret Thatcher was a lot easier to photograph than Tony Blair or David Cameron. They want to stage-manage and control things. With these shots, I feel I got some of those rare candid moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11dce4226f88749335399778249ff2054197a6df/0_11_934_561/master/934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9381aebe95db930871cda838d53c8e7","title":"uk general election 2019 poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the opinion polls.

Again, this is to preserve comparability among different polling organisations.We will update the tracker with every available poll until election day. Note that, even if the polls prove perfectly accurate, because of the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system there may be a significant discrepancy between the national share of vote received by the parties and the number of seats allotted to them in the House of Commons. Remember, too, that on the day before the general election in 2017 most pollsters were predicting a Conservative majority, in some cases of as many as 82 seats.

A match in which the lead changed hands eight times finished in a draw when Stephen Myler kicked a penalty in the final minute to leave the Bears rueing four missed opportunities from the tee.It was a sobering afternoon for Bristol who were on a high after securing the signing of the Fiji three-quarter Semi Radradra last week. London Irish played the two halves in contrasting styles: tight in the opening 40 minutes when they risked nothing in their own half and kicked for position – trusting their defensive line to frustrate the home side in the manner of South Africa – but, a man down after the break, keeping the ball in hand and more purposeful than the Bears.Bristol lacked control on an afternoon when their half-backs faltered. Andy Uren’s early box kick that went out on the full set the tone and Callum Sheedy, as well as missing three attempts at goal from eminently kickable positions, threw a careless pass after the home side scored their second try that was intercepted by Waisake Naholo, who ran 55 metres to score.Radradra would not have made the difference in this match because Bristol struggled at the breakdown, not helped by Dan Thomas’s early injury, and despite the efforts of Harry Thacker, who looked to have scored the winning try with four minutes to go, they struggled to inject pace into the game. They provided most of the match’s few moments of inidual brilliance, led by Charles Piutau, but Irish were the stronger collectively before and after Hoskins’ departure.“Sloppy” was how the Bristol head coach, Pat Lam, described his team’s performance on a day when he challenged the players to live up to their claim to the league leadership against a side that a year ago was in the Championship, but Irish are considerably more durable than the last time they were in the top flight and their other two away Premiership matches this year saw them win at Wasps and lose late on at Saracens.Here neither side could follow up a score with the next one. Bristol never led by more than five points and played as if afflicted with anxiety. Irish may have lacked the flourishing touches of the home side but they showed the greater coherence and, when Hoskins’ absence forced them to keep hold of the ball rather than boot it away, they were armed with menace.A draw was the least they deserved and their third try, from an uncontested scrum after Irish ran out of props, summed up a difference between the sides: Bristol were at their best in broken play but Irish were the more structured and, by controlling the breakdown, they set the tone.Sheedy gave Bristol the lead with his one successful penalty out of three on 27 minutes but Irish led 7-3 at the interval after a fast move down the blindside was finished by Ben Meehan. Hoskins’ red card gave the crowd voice and, when Nathan Hughes scored five minutes after the restart following Thacker’s pass out of the back of his right hand, the home faithful sensed a procession.Hughes then conceded a penalty to allow Myler to restore Irish’s advantage and the tit-for-tat continued. Piutau’s try after Piers O’Conor’s smart pick-up was followed by Naholo’s interception. Back came Bristol through Luke Hamilton’s rampaging run along the right wing but, after John Afoa was sent to the sin-bin for slowing the ball down, Tom Parton scored from the scrum after Irish had turned down the chance to draw level through a penalty under the posts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/512d18204e34916dfac56a8573d1a471e03b7cb4/0_0_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8af7b9e3a8a5c9c4d0c7130f31e6b2e5","title":"lewis hamilton in total command to win abu dhabi f1 grand prix","story":"Hamilton’s run from pole to the flag was as clinical a piece of execution as he exhibited all year. Having opened a gap from the off he did not relinquish it to complete his 11th win this season, equalling his own record. He stood atop the podium alongside Max Verstappen in second and Charles Leclerc in third – a lineup of what is hoped to be the protagonists in the championship next year.After seven years at Mercedes, Hamilton has one more year on his contract and speculation has been rife that the 34-year-old might like to see out his career with Ferrari. He did not deny that had already met twice this year with their chairman, John Elkann, and admitted he was considering how to finish his time in F1.“Naturally everything that happens behind closed doors is always private with whoever you end up sitting with,” he said. “ I love where I am so it’s definitely not a quick decision to do something else, but of course I think it’s only smart and wise for me to sit and think of what I want … If it is the last period or stage in my career.”On the track, Formula One’s season finale lacked spectacle. It was largely a procession in the desert – almost the season in microcosm. Hamilton magisterial to win, Ferrari floundering and Verstappen’s mercurial touch enlivening a drab finale. There was even a cameo for Carlos Sainz in the McLaren to cap a fine season for the British team.Hamilton has had to fight hard this year but he made this look easy, beating Verstappen by a full 16 seconds and closing on a high as he considers the final two records left to tilt at next season: Michael Schumacher’s seven titles and 91 victories.Ferrari, in contrast, have struggled for pace, suffered from operational errors, driver mistakes and reliability. They have only three wins, a tally matched by Red Bull. Here Leclerc was 43 seconds off Hamilton. Worse still they had once more complicated their own efforts even further by declaring the amount of fuel in Leclerc’s car before the race inaccurately. They were investigated and the result hung in the balance until well after the race when they were ultimately fined €50,000 (£43,000).Reflecting on the season the team principal, Mattia Binotto, was honest on their shortcomings. “We did our best but we are unhappy with the performance of the car, with mistakes, with reliability problems, with some decisions,” he said. “We need to look ahead. We did our best, it is not yet sufficient.”The result did ensure Leclerc finished fourth in his first season for Ferrari, solidly beating his teammate Sebastian Vettel into fifth in the championship. He has two wins to Vettel’s one and has consistently looked more comfortable and quicker in the car. Vettel began the season with No 1 driver status but Leclerc has clearly earned parity and Binotto said next season they would be allowed to race as equals from the off.Verstappen’s second was impressive after battling with power unit problems but showing his usual enthusiasm and verve. He has all three of Red Bull’s win this year and his typically bold move, late-braking to e down the inside of turn eight and past Leclerc for second was the highpoint of action on track.McLaren already had fourth in the constructors’ championship but they and Sainz wanted to cap it with sixth place in the drivers’. They gambled on a final late pit stop for fresh rubber and Sainz hared after Nico Hülkenberg’s Renault.Catching him on the final lap, Sainz made his move at turn 11, the last overtaking opportunity, and made it stick to take 10th place and one point. Enough to guarantee sixth, a rightly celebrated achievement for driver and team with which to close 2019.Vettel was in fifth. Alexander Albon was in sixth, while Valtteri Bottas came back well from 20th after an engine penalty to take fourth. Racing Point’s Sergio Pérez was seventh with Lando Norris eighth for McLaren, Toro Rosso’s Daniil Kvyat was ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44cdb468ba297aeb00063341137a6b2842786b64/0_56_4862_2918/master/4862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627aaff7bdc032966158147f94945999","title":"cricket new zealand england second test day four live","story":"101st over: England 273-5 (Root 115, Pope 7) Root feathers Southee away to point for one Southee has the slips wider than usual, which makes sense against Root. Pope adds a single more. “The 1989 Ashes series was the last time I had a dry series, as I was only 17 at the time,” says Simon McMahon. “So I blame English cricket, and in particular Phil Newport and John Stephenson, for the fact that my liver has had to endure thirty years of hurt since then. Never stopped me dreaming though. Come on England!”A mate and I got busted by his grandad having a beer and a tab at Headingley in 1993 we were 14. Australia made 307-3 that day, and England’s, er, attack, was Bicknell, Ilott, Caddick and McCague. And Gooch. And Thorpe.100th over: England 271-5 (Root 114, Pope 6) Pope chases a wide one and forces it away to backward point for two. A bunch of sage-faced adults stand to sing Jerusalem, with actions. I know. They applaud themselves subsequently. Matt Henry has the ball to finish his over from last evening...Right then, let’s get involved. He also says his white-line fever comes from how hard you have to work to get to play international cricket. He doesn’t have the skills the likes of Anderson do, he explains, so has to have a proper engine. He’s currently third in the Test rankings. Neil Wagner tells Athers that however flat a pitch, batting last to save a Test isn’t fun. He says that the pitches in this series aren’t typical of NZ, and that young bowlers need to play on a variety of tracks so that they can do everything, but you learn your craft when you’re not getting help. I really hope we get a good chunk of Ollie Pope today. He looks to have everything necessary to be very good, and it’s just a matter of when he puts it all together. “‘...once the scores are round about level, he’ll step on it’”?  says Harkran Sumal. “Man alive, sound the hubris klaxon! Looking at what’s to come after these two, I’d take parity, and would be dancing in the streets if offered 400. Steady on!”That’s how I think he’ll play it if he can. Parity doesn’t get England anywhere. He thinks England need to get well past NZ if they can, and the surface is deteriorating so he can see the game speeding up. Root tells Ian Ward that he’s been working hard, “Trying to get rhythm back into my hands, pick them up a bit more, that generally gets my feet going. Little things that don’t look much on the screen make a huge difference,” he says, and also that he was “trying to be over-perfect”. Ian Smith thinks the pitch is getting a bit up and down, but not quickly enough to help New Zealand today. “You can play on this for a fortnight and nobody will spin it,” says Bumble. It’d be classic captain-era Root for him to get out early this morning, and he’ll know that. I’d expect him to go carefully to being with, then once the scores are round about level he’ll step on it. “Reasons to be cheerful, part one,” says Andrew Chappell. “I have really been enjoying imagining myself on those lovely sunny, grassy banks, in NZ. The grounds are idyllic.Of course, I am stuck in the early winter doldrums here in Montreal at the moment, so in fact, cold November rain in London would look almost as appealing.”I do wonder if the banks are a faux ami – sitting on grass all day doesn’t sound great. But yes, I could cope. “Evening Daniel, evening everyone,” emails Harkarn Sumal. “I watched the first 90 minutes last night before toddling off to bed. It seemed that New Zealand’s seamers were just hammering away on a middle and leg line to Joe Root, well back of a length, and that on this featherbed of a wicket, this approach was simply feeding paddles and pulls. I know Wagner loves banging it in all day long, but what exactly were they trying to achieve there? It’s not as if they were packing the field on that side to dry us up with leg theory. It made for very odd viewing. I went off up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire with a furrowed brow. Any light to shed?”I guess they were trying to make him antsy by drying up the runs, but it didn’t work. I agree it’s kind of odd though – tempting him to drive and flash seems a better strategy. A friend of ours and student of this thing of ours, Rob Smyth, suggests that England’s 2000-01 visit to Pakistan was the last time they played a series this dry. I guess that’s been mainly forgotten in the joy of the climax. Reminder: we’ll be starting half an hour earlier this morning, to help compensate for time we’ve lost. We’re all friends here and friends need to be honest with each other, so let’s be honest about this: it’s a long, long time since England played a series as dull as this series has been. And no, this isn’t something I think because England are poised to lose it – like all normal people, I take enormous pleasure in watching the team I support suffer – but is something I think because the pitches have been as dull as these pitches have been.Of course you want conditions to be different around the world, of course you don’t want every pitch to be green of course you enjoy slow periods, of course you don’t want matches done in fewer than four days. But you should want every track, however flat, to offer something to the bowlers – whether pace, bounce or turn – and you should want every track, however flat, to have some character. But here we are now, perhaps on the cusp of liveliness. England need to make runs as quickly as possible in order to force a win, while New Zealand will want quick wickets to set up a slog then a skittling. Fingers crossed, pals.

These boxes contained, among other things, negatives and transparencies from Mendel’s harrowing first few years as a photojournalist during the struggle against apartheid in the mid-80s.Over the next three decades, Mendel became renowned for his intimate, socially engaged photography, documenting the effects of the HIVAids crisis and climate breakdown. For one project, from his Drowning World series, he has gathered nearly 2,000 water-damaged family photographs picked up on his journeys through flooded communities in the US, India and elsewhere.In this image, taken at a mass funeral in Duduza township outside Johannesburg in 1985, the damage forms a frame within a frame, cropping the image to highlight the protester. The effect is “amazing”, says Mendel, even if the context was sobering: the young activists being buried were killed when an undercover agent gave eight people booby-trapped hand-grenades, which exploded when the pins were pulled. Funerals such as this often led to further outbreaks of violence, and more funerals.“The original images have an almost radioactive energy from that period they carry all the weight of history,” says Mendel. “And then you have this new layer, the effects of water and time and mould on the images” – they speak to Mendel of the deterioration of memory, and the fading of hope in post-apartheid South Africa – “which creates a much more complex and nuanced statement than the photograph can make on its own. It takes the image into a whole new dimension.”Freedom Or Death by Gideon Mendel is published by GOST (£35)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ab8b49c5a583fd4e31f77e72ead42219dbc4d0/0_261_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=274eceb875f84b1661f277ca9caf9ccd","title":"strictly come dancing 2019 the quarter final live","story":"In musicals week the couples tackled everything from Oliver! to Hairspray – but who’s going into the semi finals?Well on that bombshell, it’s all over for another week – get ready for a MASSIVE SEMI next week, when our four remaining couples will be dancing TWO DANCES kick-off is at 7pm, so please join me then. Thank you all for joining in you are the chorus line every liveblogger needs, and let’s face it you’ve been making me look good for years. See you next week!We get to see Alex and Neil’s best bits, and they both say lovely things about each other as it all gets a bit emotional. They take to the floor for their final dance, to Circle Of Life from The Lion King. Which means ALEX AND NEIL are leaving Strictly. I’m sad about this, but much as I think ‘gospel hiphop samba’ should be a dance genre we ALL embrace in future, it was pretty risky for the quarter final.So how will the judges vote? Craig saves Alex and Neil, as does Motsi. Good work both. Bruno saves Chris and Karen, however, which gives Shirley the deciding vote. Shirley saves Chris and Karen, based on ‘personal taste’ – she thought their dance had more content and was more entertaining. I mean it definitely had content, it just wasn’t FOXTROT content. FFS Shirley.Alex and Neil are up next – it’s definitely could have done with more Samba content, but Alex actually dances this really well. I’m not sure she can blamed for the lack of Samba, she didn’t choreograph it. If it were me, based on that dance, I’d keep Alex and Neil over Chris and Karen. Dance-off time! First up it’s Chris and Karen, and their ‘Foxtrot’. This is much like last night, other than the timing is worse and the bits in hold are even more lethargic. Not a great performance, and it may well finish Chris off. Well, this is interesting – a battle of the non-dancers doing dances with limited relevant content. Alex and Neil scored one point fewer last night, but I’d argue they’ve made more progress overall this series. It really is going to come down to this one dance – personally I’d love to see Alex and Neil stay, but I know there are plenty out there who are very much team Chris and Karen. So who is joining Chris and Karen in the dance off? Kelvin and Oti are safe, which means ALEX AND NEIL are in the bottom two. Next week is TWO DANCES. Farewell technique, we barely knew you. Loving Idina’s red pantsuit, it’s fabulous. Dance-wise, Idina is accompanied by Giovanni and Karen contempo-wafting, but only Karen is barefoot. Brr.Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Idina Menzel. For those of you who have been on a different planet these last few years, Idina is the voice of Elsa from Frozen. Tonight she is singing ‘Seasons Of Love’ from Rent, and also her new festive album. So will this reflect tonight’s bottom two? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Emma and Anton. First couple in the bottom two: CHRIS AND KAREN. If they’re up against Kelvin and Oti, they’re toast. If it’s Alex and Neil, it could go either way. Meanwhile lowlights were Chris and Karen’s Oliver! Foxtrot, which looked fun but lacked actual Foxtrot, and Alex and Neil’s Sister Act 2 Samba which was joyful joyful to watch but was a bit hiphop heavy and Samba lite. Last night on Strictly: Musicals Week! I’ve watched all the dances again this morning (with both eyes, such a novelty!) – highlights were Kelvin and Oti’s Beauty and The Beast American Smooth, which was pure Gaston perfection, Karim and Amy’s Hairspray Jive, which got Craig’s first ten out, and Emma and Anton’s Throughly Modern Millie Charleston, which was their best dance by far despite Anton not really keeping up. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a derelict post box, Claudia in a black velvet sack. Don’t forget your letters to Santa.Dance-wise, it’s midnight blue organza contempo-waft. But not barefoot, winter has finally arrived. This is splendid. And we’re off! Tonight’s musical opener is Beverley Knight, singing Memory from Cats. Based on Facebook photos, it would seem I have an uncle who is good friends with Beverley Knight. I’ve never properly got to the bottom of this family link but probably should, because she is amazing. Missed the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, but the comments tell me that it was a solid effort from the excellent Darren Bett. Good work Darren, you can come to our Strictly Casual Christmas party. Evening all, and welcome back for this week’s quarter final results! Last night was a fun show, but if we’re ever going to make it to Christmas we need to send another couple off into the Strictly sunset. I don’t make the rules. Based on last night’s dancing, it should be a ChrisKaren vs. AlexNeil dance-off, but we can’t underestimate the power of the public vote, particularly where Chris is concerned. Of course there were a few other factors at play last last night, like not being able to vote, being able to vote 412 times, not being sure if you’d actually voted, and having no idea who you’d actually voted for. LOVE a bit of live TV voting chaos.Kick off is at 7.20pm – I see there were some spoilers down below which the moderators had removed by the time I woke up this morning.

But there’s a more hidden world of immersive art exhibitions, atmospheric arcades, floating swimming pools and edgy jazz nights to exploreExplore an under-the-radar art institutionOne art space on every trendy Parisian’s lips is the child-friendly Atelier des Lumières, a former iron foundry that hosts exquisite projection shows based on the oeuvre of a single artist – so far, it has featured Gustav Klimt and Vincent van Gogh. Expect all the walls, floors, ceilings and attendees’ faces to literally light up. The Cent Quatre cultural centre is where to head for cutting-edge contemporary art and live hip-hop, plus bargains from the on-site Emmaüs Défi store. If you’re into photography – and have a day or two to spare – the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, the Jeu de Paume and the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson make a truly world-beating trio.Survey the skylineThat lineup of magnificent sights stretching from Notre Dame to Les Invalides is best viewed not from the Eiffel Tower, but from the north-eastern Parc de Belleville. Climb up to the graffiti-clad Belvédère Willy Ronis on a weekday and chances are you’ll be the only one there. Another underappreciated panorama, this time facing Sacré-Cœur, can be found 20 minutes’ walk away, from the Temple de la Sybille folly perched 50 metres above the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont’s artificial lake. Jean Nouvel’s epic Philharmonie de Paris offers both an exemplary concert programme and photo-worthy rooftop views. More adventurous types will take to the left bank’s Parc André Citroën, where you can float 150 metres up beneath a helium-filled balloon.Get up close with Paris’s avant gardeSurrealists may have dominated Montparnasse in the 1920s – Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Man Ray were regulars at its salons and cafes – but Russian émigré Ossip Zadkine still hadn’t let cubism go. His tranquil studio and garden on the Rue d’Assas brim with angular, African-inspired sculptures in red wood, plaster, stone and clay. The Musée Zadkine is one of several well-preserved former artists’ studios and homes that hark back to yesteryear Paris. Just around the corner, the Musée Bourdelle is both homely atelier and sprawling art museum, while the Fondation Giacometti houses a reconstruction of his storied studio and an exhibition of some of his greatest works, including the Grande tête mince. Up in Pigalle, the cavernous top levels of the Musée National Gustave Moreau shouldn’t be missed, and the same goes for the Musée de la Vie Romantique, a quaint villa built by Dutch painter Ary Scheffer that’s now a museum dedicated to the Romantic era.Reclaim the city’s abandoned railwaysAbandoned to nature since 1934 and encircling pretty much the whole city, La Petite Ceinture railway network will probably never run again (though, some think it should). These days, the public parts of the 12-mile route – in the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 20th arrondissements – make for an unexpectedly lush urban ramble. One former station in the north has been converted into urban farm and eco-friendly restaurant La Recyclerie, and another’s become Le Hasard Ludique, a multipurpose arts space that hosts everything from tango lessons to drag nights. Train stations, it seems, are Paris’s new cool: two recent openings – experimental music venue La Station Gare des Mines and jazz club La Gare – put on the city’s edgiest nights out.Duck into an old-world arcadeShould it sheet down – which, frankly, isn’t all that unlikely – the city’s hidden network of passages couverts make for the ideal atmospheric escape. You could spend days browsing these “covered passages”, with their quaint boutiques and tasteful teahouses. Snaking through the Grands Boulevards area and down towards the Louvre, the Passage des Panoramas is best for lunch, Passage Verdeau for antiques (and waxworks at the Musée Grévin), and Galerie Vivienne for high-end fashion. Don’t miss Galerie Vivienne’s gorgeous glass roof and beautiful mosaicked floors. And when you’re done, head to the Rue des Lombards for live jazz at one of the strip’s handful of legendary clubs, such as the Baiser Salé, the Duc des Lombards or SunsetSunside.Take the plunge at a scenic swimming spotYou might not be able to swim in the Seine, but you can swim on it. Moored next to the imposing Bibliothèque François Mitterrand in the south-east, the Piscine Joséphine Baker is a floating pool complete with saunas, hammams, a jacuzzi, and to-die-for Seine views, preserved in winter by a sliding glass roof. Built in the 1920s, the Butte-aux-Cailles swimming pool is another option for those looking to go for a dip in the great outdoors (there’s an indoor pool and two outdoor pools). And don’t worry about getting chilly the water is a balmy 28C.Pay tribute to the city’s illustrious deadIf you haven’t already been on a teenage pilgrimage to pay Jim Morrison and Oscar Wilde your respects, then it’s well worth spending a day trying to locate them in the 44-hectare Cimetière du Père Lachaise. Molière, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Colette, Édith Piaf: it’s easy to stumble upon recognisable names here. Take a map, or don’t – this place lends itself to an aimless gander. Less likely to throng with tour groups are the low-key Cimetière de Montmartre (Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Degas, François Truffaut) and Cimetière de Montparnasse (Charles Baudelaire, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir).

It also raises the prospect that Merkel, who has said she will not run for another term in office, will face an earlier exit from the political stage than she intended.The 67-year-old political economist who joined the SPD at the age of 31, has sometimes been referred to as Germany\u0027s Bernie Sanders for his insistence that the SPD must lead the country out of the neoliberal wilderness. He has said the SPD had drifted into believing that lower taxes and VAT rises were the best way to run the country, and he would look to reverse this thinking, in the unlikely event he was elected co-leader.The father of four who paints and sculpts in his spare time, earned a reputation as a risk taker willing to take on the rich and powerful during his time as finance minister in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany´s most populous state, when he paid €19 million for CDs containing whistleblower\u0027s data on thousands of Swiss bank clients. The move prompted tens of thousands to voluntarily pay back €7.2bn in unpaid taxes.In an interview with the  last month, Walter-Borjans - often referred to as NoWaBo for short - said the country was in need of a large amount of investment and that he would rather Germany abandoned its commitment to balancing the federal budget, the so-called black zero, to free up money for this. If the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero.”\u0026nbspThe 58-year-old from Baden-Württemberg is even less well known than her male counterpart. She joined the SPD at the age of 29, and has been in the Bundestag since 2013, taking a clear left-wing position, and like Walter-Borjans also critical of the SPD´s neoliberal politics under Gerhard Schröder, and voting against a tightening of the government\u0027s extradition policy, but has largely remained low-profile.\u0026nbspMarried with three children, she counts among her hobbies woodland walks with her dog, as well as music and literature.During the campaign as well as criticising the grand coalition, she made a particular point of stressing the need for reform of the European Union including introducing a Union-wide fiscal policy including cracking down on tax evasion.\u0026nbspThe immediate focus is now on Scholz. If he decides he has to resign from his ministerial roles as a result of the defeat, the coalition would in effect be over, even if an election would not happen until well into next year.The uncertainty reflects the tensions at the heart of German politics, following ever stronger challenges to the mainstream parties from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, the leftwing Die Linke and the Greens.The central plank of the leadership campaign by Walter-Borjans and Esken was their opposition to the SPD’s participation in the coalition, which is in part blamed for its decreasing support. Many in the party believe that governing in Merkel’s shadow has contributed to its poor showings in regional and European elections this year, which in turn led to the resignation of Andrea Nahles, the SPD’s first female leader.It is the first time the party will have two people at the helm, with the new leaders, who are due to be sworn in at the SPD’s headquarters next Friday, saying they will only consider continuing to support the government if major concessions are made by the CDU.Among their main demands are an increase in the minimum wage from €9 an hour to €12 and a backtrack on the government’s central fiscal policy of balancing the federal budget, known as the “schwarze Null” or the “black zero”, to allow for more spending on infrastructure and welfare programmes. They are also calling for a more radical approach on the climate emergency.The CDU has made it clear it is unlikely to accept such demands. Speaking after the result, Paul Ziemiak, the party’s general secretary, said: “Our aim is to govern Germany well, and the foundations for this are in our coalition agreement. This internal decision by the SPD changes nothing in this regard.”If the coalition dissolves, Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, would have to choose whether to resign, call a confidence vote, or attempt to lead a minority government under her leadership or that of someone else within the CDU, or to start negotiations over the formation of a new government.Addressing the party, Eskens said she recognised the need to bring the party together. “If we want to succeed we need everyone,” she said. “Not only those who voted for us. We extend our hands to everyone. Now is the time to stand together.”Asked whether he believed the coalition was on the verge of collapse, Walter-Borjans said: “Ah, not yet, let’s wait and see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee3509cb3a2299a68d7c7dde1650a8741e4cd8fc/0_109_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b932c72cd159139c1ddc684def9c4663","title":"luanda angola new wave standup comedy scene","story":"A hot and humid Sunday night in Luanda. In a poor neighbourhood near the centre of the Angolan capital, bats wheel in the darkness and loud techno drowns out the traffic on the potholed road. A young crowd has packed into a cavernous and crumbling concrete church in search of comic, rather than spiritual, relief.Many have come to see Artur Pop, a comedian from a tough nearby neighbourhood who draws his material from the lives of young people such as those who have paid 1,000 kwanza – £1.28 at black market exchange rates, or more than £1.55 at the official bank rate – for the evening’s entertainment.“He’s great. He gives us a voice we haven’t ever had before,” says Edamaria Alberto, a 19-year-old student, as she pays for her ticket.Angola receives little global attention, despite an extraordinary recent history of war, boom and bust. The country of 30 million people is now on the brink of a brighter future after decades of chaos, corruption and violence. Yet challenges are multiple – and could easily derail any tentative progress.Making an appearance at the Santo António church in Hoji Ya Henda is Tiago Costa, the most high-profile of a new wave of young comedians in the vast former Portuguese colony.Costa, 34, remembers two main turning points during his life. The first was the end of the bloody and destructive civil war in 2002. This ushered in an economic boom fuelled by high oil prices – Angola is a major producer – and then an equally spectacular crash five years ago. The second was the election of president João Lourenço in 2017 after his predecessor, José Eduardo dos Santos, stepped down after 38 years.“Two years ago people were very nervous when we told a joke. Now the atmosphere is more free. We can say the president is ugly and everyone will laugh. Life in Angola today is like a good barbecue sauce ... It is sweet, but also a bit spicy,” says Costa.The boom saw growth rates among the highest in the world, and glass skyscrapers soared among the rundown colonial buildings of Luanda’s spectacular seafront. The economy is only just recovering from the crash, with government budgets still crippled by massive debts. Dos Santos was widely accused of nepotism and industrial-scale corruption. Huge sums remain unaccounted for.Lourenço, who was defence minister under the former president, has vowed to fight corruption and surprised observers with a swath of initiatives soon after taking power. But analysts say the pace of reform has slowed and frustration is mounting.“Politics is still a sensitive subject but there are lots of good jokes about the former president and his family,” says Maestro Ignacio, one of the new comedians who is a close collaborator of Costa at Goz’aqui, an online platform production company and general humour factory in Luanda.Another target is the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party that has ruled Angola for more than four decades.The bloody conflict that followed independence from Portugal in 1975 is also material for the comics.Emmanuel Quituto, a video producer who was 10 years old when the war ended with the death of Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), agrees.“I lost an uncle in the war. We don’t know what happened to him. His body was never found. But I find the jokes funny,” says Quituto.The conflict ruined Angola, and today, while a small elite enjoys the fruits of the economic boom, millions of Angolans remain mired in deep poverty.The profound inequality is evident to the most casual visitor to Luanda. Out on the Ilha, a narrow spit of sand extending into the Atlantic Ocean, wealthy business people or well-connected officials enjoy seafood lunches with South African wines for about £40 a head. At the marina, yachts manned by Italian crews are moored next to an infinity pool. In the centre of the city, SUVs bounce over the potholes.But there are also vast poor neighbourhoods where rubbish and stray dogs fill the streets and families live in breezeblock houses. Then there are the miles of urban sprawl: factories, shabby malls and apartment blocks alongside Chinese-built roads. Even in the centre of Luanda there are pockets of desperate poverty.“We can see the big buildings where the rich people live and we wonder why the government does nothing for us,” says Talitha Miguel, 41, who lives in a makeshift corrugated home in a crowded squatter camp a short walk from the parliament’s new £154m neocolonial style building.Even the inequality provides material for the new wave of comedians.“I find what people enjoy the most is when I talk about things that happen on a regular basis to regular people. So I joke about drinking because there’s a lot of alcohol abuse, and about how difficult it is to get a girlfriend when you’re poor,” says Ladilson Manuel, 26, whose YouTube channel has 35,000 subscribers.Raúl Danda, the vice-president of opposition party Unita, believes the time has come for politicians to offer an inclusive programme for all Angolans. “We don’t want there to be first-, second- or third-class citizens here … Angolans need to be treated equally. The president needs to be a father to all the people,” Danda says.The comedians are aware that their audience represents only a small and relatively privileged part of Luanda’s inhabitants. “Comedians must have a social responsibility,” says Costa. “We are not just there to put smiles on people’s faces. There is unemployment, the cost of living is higher than ever. With our jokes we can make people reflect on what we have done in our country, what we are doing and, I hope, what we should do.”Arturo Pop has a less elevated vision of his role. “I just talk about my life,” he says. “We might not have enough to eat, but you can always laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c35b2ff189083cfda4cc0a6873c5ce7bc6c1078/0_163_4895_2937/master/4895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ff75b79e52b58736384fbafe83eaf2e","title":"venice referendum autonomy independence mestre depopulation","story":"Giorgio Suppiej was badly beaten up when he campaigned for Venice to break away from its mainland borough, Mestre, in 1979. He was 18 at the time and was set upon as he attended a demonstration in support of autonomy by a gang deliberately dispatched by opponents to sabotage the vote.“They were people sent by the most violent parties of the period,” said Suppiej, a lawyer and president of Venezia Serenissima, a cultural association. “It took me two months to recover.”That referendum was unsuccessful, as were subsequent ones in 1989, 1994 and 2003. Venetians and their neighbours in Mestre go to the polls for a fifth time on Sunday and, while the atmosphere is nowhere near as vicious as it was 40 years ago, emotions are raw following the recent devastating flooding. With support building on both sides of the lagoon, campaigners say that on this occasion they might just achieve independence.The floods, the worst since 1966, further exposed Venice’s fragility and unleashed long-held grievances over issues such as mass tourism, the behemoth cruise ships that chug through the historic Giudecca Canal and a corruption scandal that has embroiled the severely delayed flood barrier project, Mose.“Venice is furious,” said Suppiej, whose experience in 1979 only made him more determined to fight for autonomy. “Our problems have got much worse – there is the lack of a physical safeguard, tourism is badly managed, speculation is unfettered, artisans have gone and – most importantly – the population is decreasing. Venice has been reduced to a cash cow and the only way to save it is through independence.”Venice has 11 inhabited islands and was in control of its own administration until Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime combined it with the industrial Mestre in 1926. The plan worked relatively well until Venice’s population declined, Mestre’s grew and money that was intended to preserve the former got erted into developing the latter, bringing with it shopping centres and huge hotels.Venice’s population has fallen from about 175,000 in the post-second world war years to 55,000 today. And while almost triple the number of people live in Mestre, those campaigning there for autonomy say residents are also deserting the city as it is mainly a place that caters to budget tourists whose only aim is to see Venice.“We are convinced that the two places immediately need two distinct administrations with two distinct mayors, as the problems are so different,” said Maria Laura Faccini, a spokesperson for Mestre Mia, a cultural association.“Venice is beautiful, fragile and needs all the attention possible as it has some very difficult problems. But it isn’t much better on the other side – we also have citizens leaving because it’s not such a nice place to live – there are few services, shops are closing and it’s full of concrete hotel blocks.”Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, is vehemently against the referendum and even took legal action to try to block it, despite promising a vote in his 2015 election campaign. He has urged citizens to snub the ballot, arguing that independence would come at a huge cost and that it would take years to untangle bureaucracy.Nicola Pellicani, a parliamentarian for the centre-left Democratic party who lives in Mestre, also opposes the referendum.“This is the fifth time we have voted on what I think is an anachronistic theme,” he said. “To believe that big problems that have been there for years can be resolved by a small commune is an illusion. What we need is a strong administration – we have never had this.”Authorities seem to be doing their best to ensure a low turnout. Only six posters publicise the referendum on Venice’s main island, while those who hung banners outside their homes campaigning for independence were last week ordered by police to remove them or be fined for “electoral propaganda”.As the vote has approached, debates have grown more bitter, with insults traded and each side accusing the other of spreading fake news.Speaking to people living iIn Canareggio, a neighbourhood in Venice’s historic centre, voters were split between saying “yes” in the ballot, and remaining undecided. “The referendum is important but it shouldn’t be a priority right now,” said Martina Cavagnis, who owns a bar in the area.Supporters of autonomy look with envy towards Cavallino-Treporti, a peninsula in the lagoon with a population of 13,500 that split from Venice after a referendum in 1998.“We’ve been able to invest more resources, be better organised and develop the territory better,” said Roberta Nesto, the mayor of Cavallino-Treporti. “Nobody would vote to return to being under Venice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

The results mean Fine Gael has failed to win a seat and this further reduces the Government’s already flimsy majority on confidence votes in the Dáil.With a confidence vote in the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy due in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, it means that the survival of the Government is now dependent on the votes of independent TDs who have no formal arrangement with Fine Gael Denis Naughten, Noel Grealish, Peter Fitzpatrick and Michael Lowry.The emerging results represent a blow for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who had pinned his hopes on a win in Dublin Mid West, but a stuttering campaign and huge embarrassment in the party about Wexford candidate Verona Murphy’s comments about immigrants meant that these byelections were even harder than usual to win for an incumbent government.Sinn Féin boostBoth the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe sought to play down the results, but there is little doubt that the results are a disappointment for Fine Gael, if not huge surprise for the party.Fianna Fáil gained one seat with its victories in Wexford and in Cork North Central, where the vacancy was created by the election of Mr Kelleher to the European Parliament in May.The Sinn Féin result in Dublin Mid West was built on an energetic local campaign and a strong get-out-the-vote operation yesterday, which confounded the pattern of record low turnouts elsewhere.It provides a much-needed boost for party leader Mary Lou McDonald after poor local and European elections.The other surprise poll-topping performance of the day was by the Green candidate in Fingal, Joe O’Brien.The Greens Dáil ranks have increased by 50 per cent and encouraging the party to believe a Green wave is possible at next year’s general elections.A clearly delighted Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Saturday the votes for the party showed they were the “clear alternative” to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100883.1575148211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin fingal joe o brien wins green party s first ever byelection","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe O’Brien: ‘We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Green Party has won its first ever Dáil byelection as Joe O’Brien emerged as the comfortable victor in Dublin Fingal.Mr O’Brien topped the poll in the 12 candidate field with 5,744 first preference votes, or just under 23 per cent of all first preferences.Turnout in the contest to fill the vacancy created by the election of Clare Daly to the European Parliament was very low at just 25.6 per cent.Mr O’Brien was deemed elected without reaching the quota on the eighth count, with a total vote of 12,315 – just shy of the quota of 12,546 – at the conclusion of the count.Fianna Fáil senator Lorraine Clifford Lee came second and Labour’s Duncan Smith came third on first preference votes and they held their positions until the end of the count.Mr O’Brien’s victory sees him join party leader Eamon Ryan and Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin in the Dáil and builds on a successful local and European elections for the Greens earlier this year.He performed well in areas such as Skerries, Portmarnock and Malahide, an indication that the pattern that support for the Greens is increasing in middle class areas of Dublin, seen in the local and European elections, is holding.Dublin Fingal is a five seat constituency and Mr O’Brien will be well placed to hold his seat at the next election.

Green Party sources said they wanted to beat Labour in this constituency at the byelection to maintain their momentum on the centre left.Speaking after the count concluded at the National Show Centre in Swords, Mr O’Brien said a lot of work had gone into his victory, but said people are “definitely” “changing their minds” on the climate issue.“We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave,” he said. “I think there’s a bit of a sea change in terms of how people are deciding where to put their votes.”Mr Ryan also said there has been a “change in the last year”.“ There is a green wave of thinking. It’s coming from younger people, but older people responding to that as well. Everyone knows now we’re in a climate crisis and a bioersity crisis.“Our job is to present the practical solutions that will allow us changes the country for the best in responding to those crises.”The Dublin Bay South TD said the number of Green TDs will increase in the next Dáil if the pattern of the past year is continued.He said he and Ms Martin were looking forward to having Mr O’Brien as a third TD.“I’d like to double and triple that again in the next election, and I think we can.

The secretary left precise instructions for when you should call her ? tomorrow between 11 am and 12 noonEllen: oh my godI knew about the royal family of Oudh, of course. They were one of the city’s great mysteries. Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shia Muslim royal line.There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4101023.1575232105!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maltese prime minister announces plans to step down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta, speaks during a press conference at the  in Valletta, Malta in December 2016. Photograph: Domenic AquilinaEPA Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat, engulfed in crisis over the investigation into a murdered journalist, announced on Sunday he planned to step down in the new year.Mr Muscat said he would ask his ruling Labour Party to start a process next month to choose a new leader for the country.Calls for Mr Muscat to quit had intensified after the investigation into the 2017 car bomb killing of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia led to charges on Saturday against a prominent businessman with alleged ties to government ministers and senior officials.In a televised address on Sunday evening, Mr Muscat said he was not leaving immediately, rather announcing a process to replace him that will start on January 12th.This drew immediate criticism from some opponents who said he should go right away.“I will write to the president of the Labour Party so that the process for a new leader is set for 12th January, 2020. On that day I will resign as leader of the Labour Party. In the days after I will resign as prime minister,” Mr Muscat said.“Our country thus will start a short process of approximately a month for the Labour Party to choose a new leader and a new prime minister,” he added.Thousands of people took part earlier on Sunday in an anti-government march in Valetta, in an event organised, among others, by activist group Repubblika, and led by members of the Caruana Galizia family.In his address, the prime minister struck a defiant tone, saying that every day since the murder he had shouldered responsibilities in “the interests of the conclusion of the case”. He added, however, that “some decisions were good while others could have been better made”.“All the responsibility I had to shoulder surely does not compare to the pain that the victim’s family is enduring,” Mr Muscat added.The crisis over the Caruana Galizia murder investigation grew after businessman Yorgen Fenech (38) was taken to a Valletta court late on Saturday and charged with complicity in the murder. He pleaded not guilty to that and other charges.Mr Fenech was charged after the government turned down his request for immunity from prosecution in return for revealing information about the murder plot and about alleged corruption involving Muscat’s former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former tourism minister Konrad Mizzi, among others, court filings showed.Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi resigned on Tuesday and Mr Schembri was interrogated for two days by police before being released without charge. Mr Schembri has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Mizzi on Tuesday denied any business links with Mr Fenech and any wrongdoing.Old friendCritics are angry with Mr Muscat for sticking by Mr Schembri, an old friend since school, and including Mr Schembri in security briefings on the murder investigation even after Mr Fenech was identified both as a suspect in the murder and an associate of Mr Schembri.In power since 2013, Mr Muscat won two general elections in a row, the last in 2017. His Labour Party had been expected to hold a leadership election in January.Critics have been pressing hard for further police investigation into allegations against Mr Schembri and other ministers, and some said Mr Muscat should have left immediately.Opposition leader Adrian Delia, in a tweet, said the country could not wait another single day for Mr Muscat to go.“He should have resigned a long time ago. Every day he stays in office means another day where justice is not done and not seen to be done. The prime minister has lost his legitimacy.”President George Vella followed Mr Muscat’s address by issuing his own statement, appealing for calm in the country.The statement added: “The president hopes that justice is done with all those involved in this atrocious act which has cast a dark shadow on the national conscience get what they deserve.”– Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Adel Abdel Mahdi steps down after months of protests that have left 420 deadAdel Abdul Mahdi\u0026rsquos move comes after widespread and violent anti-government protestsLondon-based ALQST says crackdown on dissent continues with wave of arrestsAlmost 400 killed by Iraqi security forces and unknown gunmen since protests began last monthDemonstrators consider \u0026lsquoshadow government\u0026rsquo as they face rising violenceThe world\u0026rsquos largest religious gathering in Karbala was this year marked by bloody protestsIsrael\u0026rsquos PM cannot be legally forced to resign and describes charges as \u0026lsquoattempted coup\u0026rsquoDozens killed in missile strikes in Idlib as Assad continues offensive against territoryLong-serving Israeli prime minister indicted for fraud, breach of trust and briberyNeither Netanyahu nor Gantz have been able to secure governing majority after deadlocked elections\u0026lsquoIranian attack on Israel is clear proof of the purpose of Iranian entrenchment in Syria\u0026rsquoMore than 100 protesters killed amid wave of anti-government rallies, says AmnestyPompeo announcement that settlements not considered illegal a big blow to peace deal hopesMove completes a delayed prisoner swap for three of the militant group\u0026rsquos commandersPompeo announces reversal of US policy on West Bank settlementsGovernment also announced monthly gasoline ration for each private car of 60 litresChoice of veteran politician to head up new government meets with scorn and unrestUS claims court ruling was anti-IsraelTwo days of violence left 34 Palestinians dead and brought southern Israel to standstillSecond day of violence between Israel and Islamic Jihad after militant leader assassinated"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4101049.1575216072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"iraq s parliament approves resignation of prime minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi  had offered to quit earlier but then insisted he’d only go once lawmakers agreed on a replacement.

But I can’t stand Corbyn.’ Photograph: Jennifer O’ConnellA Dutch television crew is setting up in the market square in Newcastle-under-Lyme, one of the UK’s most marginal constituencies, in the heart of the electorally volatile West Midlands. But they’re not here to make a programme about the upcoming election. “What’s happening with the election?” one of them asks.They’re making a TV show about darts, he explains, because darts player Phil Taylor owns a pub here. The show involves asking people to throw darts at a dart board to see if they can hit the bullseye, which seems as a good an analogy as any for the final two weeks of campaigning in a general election.There can’t be too many others in this borough of 130,000 who are unaware there’s an election happening – even if there does occasionally seem to be some confusion about what they’re being asked to vote on.“Same as I voted last time. I’ll still vote Leave,” says Paul Lomas, who has popped out on his lunch break for some fish and chips.Efforts by Labour to move the conversation here beyond Brexit are not proving entirely successful, admits the party’s candidate in the constituency, Carl Greatbatch, who is on the other side of the square, making a video of his own for social media. “Sixty-three per cent voted for Brexit here, so it is an issue on the doorstep. But fortunately, it’s not just about that. There’s a lot of talk about NHS cuts, local government cuts, police cuts.”On Brexit, he says, “people have had enough of it. But even if Boris gets in and gets this vote through, that’s not the end of anything. It’s the start of everything.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s neutral stance on the issue “is the only honest way forward. It’s not a culture war, despite how people are driving it as that,” he says, adding that the way forward lies in uniting people, “and having a conversation about what does Leave look like, and what does Remain look like”.Despite his outward optimism, Greatbatch will be more aware than most that Labour needs to attract every spare vote in this constituency. The party has won here by a diminishing majority at each of the last six general elections. In 2017, his predecessor, Paul Farrelly, clung on to his seat of 18 years by just 30 votes. Farrelly, an ardent Remainer, has decided not to run again, making this seat a key target for the Conservatives, in a region – the West Midlands – often seen as a crucial stop on the road to Downing Street.In H Cheadle and Son butcher shop, Neil Goode and Mark Anderson bring up the 2017 votes controversy, but they suggest it might have been the Labour MP Farrelly who benefitted. “Waste of Time Farrelly”, they call him, enraged over his opposition to Brexit. “I haven’t always voted Conservative, but I will now,” says Goode. So will Anderson. “Everybody is so fed up, they just want it all sorted. Even some of the Remains now are fed up of it.”Their customer Michael Cooper is voting Conservative for the first time in his life. “I’ve always been a Labour man. I’ve always been a union man. But I can’t stand Corbyn. I won’t vote ever Corbyn.”Back on the high street, Labour voter Michael Giliker is frustrated by how this has become the “Brexit election”.“It’s the one thing which has politicised most people in the country. It’s good that everyone has a view,” he says, but he is unhappy that “the core issues we should be fighting for” have been overtaken by Brexit. He would like someone to come up with a “Go Compare” chart for political parties, so people could choose wisely, “just like you do your insurance”.He is worried about the future beyond the election. “If Brexit goes ahead, it will just ide people even more. And that frightens me.”However, she’s taking a novel approach to deciding how to cast her vote in this ultra-marginal constituency. “Are you sure you want this on tape? I’m into the energies, and I go with how I feel on the day. I go down the village. I go into the booth. I get my pen, and I look, and I wait.”The energies might already be offering a few hints, it seems. “I think we needed something to change the energy of what’s going on, and I think Boris might be strong enough to do that.”Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

We want to help change this.“We are launching Bó to help people build the habits and routines that will allow them do money better day-by-day and week-after-week so they can fund their lives and lifestyles in a more sustainable way.“As we’re part of NatWest, people can rely on Bó to keep their money safe.While app-only banks have grown their user numbers rapidly, they have yet to become profitable.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017.

We want to help change this.“We are launching Bó to help people build the habits and routines that will allow them do money better day-by-day and week-after-week so they can fund their lives and lifestyles in a more sustainable way.“As we’re part of NatWest, people can rely on Bó to keep their money safe.While app-only banks have grown their user numbers rapidly, they have yet to become profitable.

Conservative, Labour, SNP and the Lib Dem party leaders took questions from the audience on November .Further TV General Election coverage will include:A snap election debate poll saw a narrow win for Johnson over rival Corbyn in the head-to-head.Corbyn refused nine times to say whether he would back his own Brexit deal in a bruising TV clash.The PM repeatedly pressed the Labour boss to answer in their first live debate ahead of the December  poll.The debate on November , hosted by Julie Etchingham, also saw the leaders clash over the NHS.Corbyn accused Johnson of a plot to sell out the NHS to Donald Trump.Boris replied: “It is completely untrue.“The only reason this comes up is because Mr Corbyn is trying to conceal the void at the heart of his Brexit policy and refusing to answer the question of which side he will take.The Liberal Democrats launched a legal challenge over ITVs decision to exclude leader Jo Swinson from the debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, and are reportedly considering doing the same against the BBC.Following ITVs original announcement, Swinson tweeted: Scared, boys Speaking outside the High Court after filing for a judicial review, party president Sal Brinton said: People know more about where they stand on Brexit than for which party they will vote for.So it is vital for our democracy to have both sides of the Brexit debate represented at the top table of the leaders debates.In a letter earlier sent to ITVs chief exec, she wrote: Voters of this country deserve to hear from a Remainer on the debate stage, not just from the two men who want to deliver Brexit.There is no reasonable justication for excluding Liberal Democrats from the debate. Liberal Democrats are the strongest national party of Remain.We secured more votes than both Labour and the Conservatives in the European elections earlier this year and have enjoyed fantastic local and by-election successes across the country.The Lib Dems have vowed to cancel Brexitthey win the election.An ITV spokesperson said: ITV intends to offer viewers comprehensive and fairly balanced General Election coverage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Between gasps for air, though, he managed to hand the paper over with a single instruction.“Read that.” I did.It was a review written by Clive James, The Observer’s legendary television critic, who died this week, at the age of .The year, I now discover from a collection of his work called The Crystal Bucket, was  and it must have been slim pickings for him that Sunday.There was no Eurovision Song Contest or Miss World or even an episode of The Incredible Hulk for him to dismantle. Instead he was setting the scene on a men’s downhill skiing race, at Kitzbuhel, covered by BBC’s Grandstand.“A man referred to as ‘Britain’s sole representative’ came plummeting down the Stre. ‘He won’t be looking for a first place today’, said David Vine, ‘he’ll be looking for experience’.“At that very instant — not a bit later, but while David was actually saying it — Britain’s sole representative was upside down and travelling into the crowd at mph. Spectators were mown down asby grapeshot.The air was full of snow, beanies, mittens, bits of wood. You had to be watching to get the full impact. It was kind of perfection.”The writing, it’s fair to say, hit me with the same force.My tiny, ten-year-old mind was officially blown. I’d no idea newspapers could be funny, until that moment. They were places behind which grown-up men went to hide and frown and tutt, not to be reduced to helpless, weeping wrecks.Nor did I have any idea watching the television could be a job. Paid  To watch Grandstand It was beyond anyone’s comprehension then and, slightly weirdly, after  years in the job, it’s still almost beyond my comprehension now.All of that is thanks to Clive James reinventing the role of television reviewer which, up until his arrival in , was a stuffy, reverential task performed by men, at the flat-lining end of their careers, who were still slightly in awe of the magic box in the corner of the living room.Clive James was none of those things. An Australian, he was an ambitious outsider and populist who had the honesty to point out that TV might well be a miracle of technology and incredibly popular but it wasn’t half rubbish as well.That’s the easy bit, of course. What set James apart from every other writer in Fleet Street was the poetic style and wit he did it with every single week.Since his death, from cancer, the obituaries have rightly flagged up all the one-liners which have set the industry standard ever since.He famously referred to Arnold Schwarzenegger as, “A brown condom full of walnuts”, and said of F commentator Murray Walker: “Even in moments of tranquility, Walker sounds like a man whose trousers are on fire.”The incredibly galling thing for anyone who’s trained as a journalist, though, was that James was an instinctively brilliant hack without ever wasting a day on his local newspaper.Here he is, luring me in, with another poetic intro from December .“Never since Damocles danced beneath the sword has there been anything like the World Disco Dancing Championships , brought to you live from the ravishing Empire Ballroom, Leicester Square.”Not for Clive James the high falutin’ marginal stuff, on BBC, you see, though he could do that as well. Unfashionable as it was at the time, he reviewed the television people actually watched.It meant Sundays became an event, across the nation, and our house was a minor warzone as my sister and me plotted and fought to become the first person to read his latest reviews.Those happy battles couldn’t last, though. The medium that bewitched Clive James eventually seduced him and, in , at the peak of his writing power, he became ITV’s Clive James On Television.Evenyou’re too young to remember this show, then you still most certainly live with the consequences of a programme where James held up for ridicule bad singing, from Margarita Pracatan, and a Japanese game show called Endurance, where contestants would be subjected to physical and mental torture with rats, lizards and water.At the time we thought it was some weird World War Two hangover the Japanese were working out of their system.We know now Clive James was in fact inventing the future of British television and I’m A Celebrity.The irony of this, and the debt I owe him, is not lost on me.Pick up any national newspaper today and you’ll find half a dozen journalists who owe their style, as well as the roof over their head and the food on the table, to the genius of Clive James.As you’ll quickly discoveryou read The Crystal Bucket and his November ,  review for another British TV staple, I just happen to be the most brazen tribute act.“The Royal Variety Show was hosted by Max Bygraves, who tried the time-honoured gimmick of singing the finale at the start.‘Andyou don’t like our finish, you doan have to stay for the show.’Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"voting general election opinion polls mistake","story":"There were predictions for a thumping defeat — for Boris’s opponents.The YouGov poll commissioned by The Times talked of the Tories taking as many as  seats in next month’s General Election, with Labour bagging , the Scots Nats managing  and the dribbly Lib Dems back in minibus territory with just  predicted wins.As I say, disastrous.You may think I am being sarcastic. “Come off it,” you’ll say, “this was just the boost cheerful piglet Boris will have wanted. How it must raise morale among his troops!”And what a relief to the country it will be to read this prediction of a spanking for Jeremy Corbyn and his hate-filled boot boys.Christmas has come early, you may be tempted to think.If the poll also means putting a cork in that gobby Sturgeon creature — the one who wants to prop up Corbyn in exchange for billions of pounds and another Scottish independence referendum — well, great.And as a bonus it might also restore some reality to that delusional Miss Prim, Jo “I’m Going To Be Prime Minister” Swinson. What a delicious thoughtshe takes a custard pie in the eye. I know, I know, it’s tempting.But I’m afraid I am utterly serious. This poll was the last thing Boris needed at the moment. It was deeply unhelpful and may well land us with the hung Parliament that would paralyse our country and wreck Brexit.There is, as Mr Johnson’s backroom svengali Dominic Cummings pointed out this week, a terrible danger of complacency. That works on at least two levels.First, predictions of a solid Tory win could make vital swing voters think: “Actually, Boris will win without my vote, so I’ll stick to my old, tired loyalties because habits die hard and it will stop my leftie in-laws giving me a hard time.”Second, the YouGov poll could make Conservative candidates and their campaigners feel they need not try so hard. Bad, bad idea. Voters soon spota party is becoming cocky and they don’t like it. One hint of self-satisfaction can be fatal.The moment things are said to have turned badly for Neil Kinnock in the  election was when he swaggered on stage at a Sheffield rally in the last week of the campaign and started saying: “All right, all right.”Labour were ahead in the polls at that point and it looked asKinnock thought he had already won. A couple of days later, the boastful booby lost.The ancient Greeks had a word for that sort of excessive pride: Hubris. Boris Johnson is a classicist, so let’s hope he bears it in mind. The Tories may be running a campaign based on positive vibes and blue-fringed sunshine but this is really no time for optimism.Polling day — the real poll, the one that counts — is still a fortnight away. Most voters will not mark their X on ballots until two weeks today.There is still an awfully long way to go. In opera, it ain’t over ’til the fat lady sings. Diane Abbott becomes Home Secretary, she could well reclassy any references to portly sopranos as hate speech.In politics, it ain’t over ’til the election-night programme has ended.The Conservatives could still drop an almighty blooper. One misjudged phrase from Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove or Dominic Raab could still sink the canoe.Modern politics moves incredibly fast. Just look at how Jeremy Corbyn was given a comprehensive debagging this week by TV inquisitor Andrew Neil.Corbyn entered that interview studio all full of himself. Thirty minutes later he was, in a political sense, stripped down to his skimpies and string vest, knees a-knocking. More than  years in Parliament, he had been undone in just  minutes. Or so it looks at present.That’s the other thing. Opinion polls are a snapshot of public voting intentions at a particular time in a particular week.Just because they are collated by London wonks with pink-framed spectacles and designer haircuts and baffling bar charts, that does not mean they are right.In fact, there’s a good case for saying that the more “clever” political analysts are, the more likely they are to be wrong.I have spoken to numerous Tory campaigners in the past few weeks and none of them thinks Boris is romping to victory. Time and again, you hear: “It’s tight. We could yet lose this.”Look at the opinion polls in the last days before the EU referendum, which suggested Remain would win.Look at the poll which predicted a Yes win less than a month before the Scots independence referendum in .That galvanised the No campaign and made voters think: “Yikes, there’s a chance the other side could win.”Voters do not always tell pollsters the truth. The sheer nastiness of Corbyn’s cronies, with all those anti-Semitism claims, could be making the public reluctant to admit its support for Labour.Two years ago, “everyone said” Labour hadn’t a hope of preventing a Conservative majority. “Everyone said” is a deadly presumption. Labour did indeed stop Theresa May from winning that election cleanly, and look at the mess it caused.This time round, cocooned and comforted by those opinion polls, “everyone says” Boris has it in the bag. Well, he hasn’t.The only way to stop Corbyn is to vote against him. Staying at home on December  could be the worst mistake you made. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many seats look impossibly tight.Boris Johnson’s Government is in ­danger — and Brexit with it.The survey predicting his victory may or may not be an accurate snapshot of the current mood. What is certain is the race will now tighten as a direct result.Remainers, sensing defeat, will vote tactically for whichever party can oust the Tory candidate. They will ignore the sickening racism, the lies, the terrorist friends and the economic lunacy of Corbyn’s Labour and back them anyway.Some Tory Remainers may vote Lib-Dem, complacently thinking Boris will win anyway. That may prove fatal.Tories, and all Leave voters, must be resolute. Only a Tory majority will secure Brexit and defeat Corbyn. If you want it, you MUST vote for it.The Brexit Party will not win anywhere.

Because this is not over.Andthe Tories fall agonisingly short, Brexit will be lost and Mr Farage’s party will deserve the blame.HOW can Labour, panicked by the polls, seriously now hope to pass themselves off as a Leave party  They betrayed their Leave voters and everyone knows it.Corbyn wants his Remainer lackey Keir Starmer to “negotiate” a new deal tying us into Brussels’ customs union forever.  That’s Remain in all but name.He would then hold a rigged second referendum pitting this Remain option against actually Remaining in full. His party will campaign for the latter — and give children and EU migrants the vote.Labour are simultaneously posing as a Remain party in the South while trying to masquerade as Leavers in the North.Candidates like Ed Miliband, who have fought ceaselessly to halt Brexit, pretend they voted to make it happen. It is an appalling, jaw-dropping deceit.To Leave you have one option: the Tories.WHY do the Tory-haters of Channel  News think Boris Johnson would bother attending their biased and little-watched debates Their Head of News publicly branded him a liar. Presenter Jon Snow chanted “f*** the Tories” at Glastonbury.Channel  doesn’t want to “scrutinise” the Tories in the public interest.

He’s also in prison in Germany. He’s also a paedophile.”In a bizarre twist, Amaral said the suspect looks similar to Madeleine’s dad Gerry before saying that Ney bears no resemblance to him.The slur comes after years of legal wrangling between the former police chief and the missing youngster’s parents over his book ‘The Truth of the Lie.’He claims in the controversial  book that Gerry and Kate McCann had covered up their daughter’s accidental death in their holiday apartment.The McCanns have made a last-ditch attempt to the European Court of Human Rights after losing a libel fight against Mr Amaral in Portugal.Last year Amaral claimed MI spies had helped to cover up Madeleine’s death and disappearance.He said British secret agents “for sure had an involvement” in an Australian documentary which aired in April .The McCanns have repeatedly said the fake accusations against them have harmed the search for Madeleine.Scotland Yard launched its Operation Grange investigation in  and still has a team working on the youngster’s disappearance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But curing a beer belly is a whole other matter.MOST of the glamour and lightness that we associate with champagne is because of the fizz in your mouth.But these benign bubbles actually cause epic headaches, as the alcohol gets absorbed faster.The cure – a full-sugar cola – boosts sugar levels, while its caffeine perks you up. Have it with some grilled bacon, which has lots of B vitamins, which act as a catalyst to help to get the alcohol in your system to break down.CIDER or scrumpy is one of the worst drinks for causing morning-after stomach bloat. Add fresh ginger to hot water, with a teaspoon of sugar or honey to replace lost sugars and settle your tum.If all  fails, have some chicken soup.It rehydrates and replaces lost salts and is high in tryptophan, an amino acid that helps your body produce serotonin, improving mood.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were WRONG. All those Labour toffs thought they could live without all of us thick, ignorant peasants who dared to disobey the establishment and vote for Brexit.Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, who chuckled at seeing the flag of  St George! — was wrong. Sir Keir Starmer, so passionate in his adoration of Brussels, was wrong.Corbyn — a man without a patriotic bone in his withered old carcass — was wrong. Labour’s total contempt for the working class, who they were founded to represent, has them stumbling towards defeat.So Labour are rethinking their General Election strategy.In Leave-voting areas, Labour will get down on their knees and beg the working class to come home.Even an unequivocal Remainer like Ed Miliband is pretending he has always fought for a Brexit deal.No, Ed — you fought to keep us in a single market and a customs union. You fought for a Brexit that was unworthy of the name.You fought for a deal that was worse than staying in the EU.Labour should really stop fibbing to the British people.The modern Labour Party has no love, affection or understanding of the working class. It is the Tories who now represent the values of  the working man and woman — their patriotism, their belief in democracy, their belief in family  and hard work.In working-class communities, Labour are ludicrously flexing their non-existent Leave credentials — which is both bitterly ironic and horribly hypocritical.Ask all the decent Labour MPs who have suffered torrents of abuse from Labour’s online thugs for ­daring to suggest that the Referendum result, and democracy itself, should be respected.Labour are the Remain party who are too pathetically gutless to admit it. But this election is not simply about Brexit.Infinitely more important than our relationship with the European Union is stopping an economically moronic, terrorist sympathiser like Corbyn from getting anywhere near  Downing Street.I have only ever been a member of one political party — Labour.It was the party of my family, my neighbourhood and my class.That party no longer exists.Corbyn and his Marxist muppets have ruined Labour with their sickening Jew-baiting racism, their puerile class war, their total lack of understanding of even basic ­economics.Do not let them ruin the country.Do not believe the lies that they are going to tell you over the next  days.Andyou are working class, never believe for a single second that this pathetic excuse for a ­Labour Party is on your side.Labour have thrown in their lot with privately educated revolutionaries who would rather wave a Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.And it is only now they are starting to regret it.TOSSING back her golden tresses, Charlize Theron wears a gold dress against a golden background in an ad for Dior’s J’Adore perfume – which comes in a golden bottle.It is like being buried in an avalanche of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.And that’s a compliment.And because he wasn’t there, he must also have invented the scene where a young Prince Charles sobs because he has been forced to break up with a hot young Camilla.And far more offensively, Morgan is surely making it all up when he depicts the Queen faking a tear as she witnesses the horror of  Aberfan.All the real-le photos of the Queen visiting the tragic Welsh mining village show her looking shocked  beyond belief.I do not believe she faked a tear for the cameras.I enjoy The Crown but it is only a posh EastEnders.Don’t mistake it for anything resembling  historical truth.WHAT happened to Katie Price’s £million fortune Just guessing here – she spent it.I will leave it to others to analyse Katie’s profligacy with money and just say this in her defence.She has been a loving mother to her children, including her blind, autistic son Harvey, now , who she seems to have raised single-handedly.She is an inspiration to any parents raising a disabled child.  She has confronted the evil bullies who have mocked her son.She has been a passionate campaigner to hold social media s to account and make online abuse a criminal offence.I don’t think there is anyone in the country who has been more willing to stand up to bullies than Katie.And now she is bankrupt, owing £, to her creditors.I suspect she has faced bigger battles than bankruptcy.THE Liberal Democrats thought vowing to immediately cancel Brexit when Jo Swinson becomes Prime Minister would be a vote winner.Whoops!

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made.

I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning .

And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks!

When I was four, I wanted to be a rabbit when I grew up.“I used to convert a chair into my own little hutch. I would drape a blanket over the top of it and go into my hutch with my book, sketchbook and pencils. I was totally happy. The first book that sparked something in me was The Tiger Who Came To Tea by Judith Kerr.“I loved the idea something so extraordinary can happen right in the middle of a very domestic setting. It sparked something in me.“For five-year-old Alex, the thought of going to a cafe in the night in my pyjamas seemed like the most exciting thing that could ever happen.”Alex adds: “Even as an adult, reading is something I have to do. If I’ve been incredibly busy and not had so much time to do it, I don’t feel as happy or connected to things.“When I’m working, I listen to audio books. I find they get me in a bookish frame of mind.“I’ve written for children for  years and I love it more than ever. It’s a big honour to write for children. There is something magical about it.”Alex does a lot of school visits and says that is an important part of writing for youngsters. He says: “Children are so sophisticated, funny and weird. Meeting them is really important.“I’d like to think that they look at me and realise drawing can be an actual job too!“It’s very important that children are aware of all the dferent jobs that they can do.“I really do believe that anyone can draw. Of course some people have an innate talent — and I suppose I was quite good naturally. However, I put in hours and hours of practice.“Even now, I love drawing as much as ever.“If ever I’ve got spare time, I’ll more than likely pick up my sketchbook, evenI’ve been drawing all day.”.

If she looks exactly like Holby City’s uptight heart consultant Jac Naylor – the character she’s played for the past  years – it’s because she’s stepped straight off the set and into BBC Elstree’s scruffy backstage green room meeting us between scenes. Thankfully, unlike the frosty-faced, hard-as-nails doc who viewers have grown to love, the real Rosie is warm and open, greeting us with a hug. She sips from a water bottle and has one of those immaculate complexions that suggests she downs two litres of the stuff a day. ‘I can assure you I don’t,’ laughs the actor, who lives with second husband Ben Stacey, a gym owner, their five-year-old daughter, Beau, and their four dogs in St Albans. ‘I’m wearing a lot of make-up! I haven’t resorted to Botox yet, but I’m looking forward to it!’ Settling down on the sofa for a natter, Rosie explains how filming Jac’s harrowing nervous breakdown scene, which airs this week, was traumatic because it mirrored her own le three years ago, when she crashed out with depression, anxiety and depersonalisation disorder. Given your mental health struggles, was it emotional, acting Jac’s breakdown  It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my le. When I was first approached about the storyline, I wasn’t happy at all. In fact, I was frightened. But after a lot of cajoling from my agent and the producers, and talking with my husband, I decided it was an important story to tell on behalf of other working mothers. Can you tell us about your own breakdown  Like many first-time mums, I was overwhelmed. Six months after having a baby by C-section, I ed to working long days and I wasn’t being healthy. Scripts were coming in very late and none of what I was reading made sense. One day, I just lost it and shouted at people that they were stopping me from seeing my kid and having a le. A director marched me off set, I called my doctor and I was signed off work immediately.  What were you eventually diagnosed with  Stress, anxiety and depersonalisation disorder – that means you don’t feel like you’re in your own body, you don’t recognise yourself. I remember going home, getting into my pyjamas and looking down on myself asfrom a dferent part of the room. In that moment, I decided everyone would be better off without me. I walked out of the house, without my phone or anything, with no intention of coming back. I turned up at my friend’s house having no idea how I got there. It was pretty scary. How did you get better  I found a therapist. I was reluctant at first because, in all honesty, I saw it as a sign of weakness. My siblings and I were all brought up to be strong iniduals. My mother left when I was very young and we learnt to look after ourselves. I’m a very strong person on the outside. But that all caught up with me.  It’s brave to open up, though... I don’t like people to see I’m vulnerable, but by putting my struggles out there, I hope to help people. All the comments I’ve received have been positive, which is rewarding. Let’s face it, the rest of what I do is just telly, isn’t it  I spent a lot of my childhood wanting people to like me. But I’ve given up on that –you don’t like me that’s fine. I’m  and I finally like myself. How much of your own experience did you bring to your breakdown scenes  Everything. I had a say in the scripts and was allowed a day a week for therapy. I absolutely needed to talk it out, after putting myself back in a vulnerable position. I found it very distressing, watching the scene back where Jac totally loses it in front of her daughter and needs restraining, as did my husband. I still get anxiety about it. I was in a really tired, dark place at the end of filming, so I took three weeks off. I slept a lot and did normal things: I took my kid to school, I walked my dogs, I cleaned my house, I cooked for my family – all the things I really enjoy. If I weren’t at Holby, I would absolutely be a housewe!  How do you stay mentally strong now  Therapy will always be part of my le. I’m lucky enough to be able to afford it. I meditate for  minutes every day and haven’t drunk alcohol in two years. I really miss a lovely glass of red wine, but it’s not good for my mental health. How are your other health issues  You’ve battled endometriosis, haemophilia, the inflammatory disease Behcet’s, and cervical cancer  I’m a bit of a mess, aren’t I  I’ll be on immunosuppressants my whole le. I do feel terribly sorry for myself some days and I sit and cry, but I pick myself up. I’ve got a strong personality and, as an ill person, I don’t like to be told I can’t do things. I enjoy a challenge – I’d love to do something like … and would be horribly competitive. But I’m such an animal lover, I’m not sure how I would manage eating kangaroo balls!    Is Ben very supportive  He knows me better than anyone  and has seen parts of me no one  has. He’s seen me walk out in the middle of the night and not come back, and seen me not being safe to be around my daughter – not that I would ever have been a risk to her, but I was just in such a bad place. And he’s the person who says to me, ‘You need to see your therapist.’ He spots it in me before I do. He’s very good. I know when he’s stressed because he throws himself into a workout.  Do people sometimes think you’re a real doctor  My grandmother would often show me a mark on her arm, asking, ‘What do you think it is ’ I’d keep telling her, ‘I don’t know. I’m not actually a doctor.’ Once a girl fainted right in front of me and someone shouted, ‘Help her!’ and I shouted back, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing!’ What’s the weirdest place you’ve been asked for a selfie  Disneyland. I posed wearing a pair of Mickey Mouse ears, embarrassing! How will you spend Christmas this year  We have friends coming – we’re godparents to their children – and I’ll cook. I can’t stand turkey – it’s too dry for me – so I’ll do a chicken and a proper glazed ham with Yorkshire puds.  The tree won’t last five minutes as we have four dogs – it’ll be chaos! Last year, I went a bit OTT with gts and Beau said halfway through the present-opening, ‘I don’t want to open any more’. I love watching old films with her – Annie, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Elf. Then I’ll take the leftover ham to enjoy with my sister on Boxing Day – she’s over from LA.

Now, itaposs either some complicated science fiction adaptation or – here we go again – another bloody general election debate. The line up for this one, staged by ITV in Salford, included two  debutants: UKIPaposs – sorry, the Brexit Partyaposs – Nigel Farage and, for Labour, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon. Seasoned Westminster watchers found the choice of Burgon somewhat, um, courageous, shall we say  But remember Labouraposs switch last week to thrust forward frontbenchers with regional accents who are not wedded to staying in the EU. This, of course, is aimed at shoring up the Red Wall the party fears will fold to the Brexit-backing Tories. There were surely inaudible groans when host Julie Etchingham told us this latest showdown would last two hours.But Julie thataposs, like, longer than a football match. Even factoring in VAR. Tory representative Rishi Sunak, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, set the tone in his opening statement, telling viewers: “You, me, everyone is fed up. We just want to move on.” I agree but steady on, mate, weaposre only four minutes in. Turns out he was on about Brexit. Again. “Letaposs Get This Debate Done,” he didnapost actually say. Farage branded Boris Johnsonaposs deal a “half in, half out fudge”. This after embattled Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said the Prime Minister couldnapost be bothered to come because “heaposs leaving it to his cheerleader Nigel Farage – andthey win, we lose”. That she was using this attack line so early suggested two things:  she finally realises her campaign really is going badly as she was warned it might and  she didnapost have much faith in viewers lasting the course to pm. Green co-leader Sian Berry was earnest, plausible and likeable – and you wonderone day voters will come to regret not listening earlier and more closely to her partyaposs message on the environment. Farage, who thrives on primetime exposure, power without responsibility and pumping out populist rhetoric, was, predictably, aiming to secure his core vote rather than widen his appeal. In that, he will surely have succeeded. And when he launched adefence of his pal Donald Trump over his “pussy-grabbing” comments it was classic Farage playing to a populist base. It was crass and crude and wrong and men say dreadful things sometimes”, said Farage.  He added that men were likely to say such things after “a night out with a drink” - ignoring the fact Trump is teetotal. And he may have stripped away some Tory votes in Leave-supporting areas the Conservatives must win for a Commons majority. Oh, and he had by far the best tie. Plaid Cymruaposs Adam Price was less good than at Fridayaposs debate in Cardf, now the novelty value has worn off.  Wide-eyed and raging, he was certainly not trying to win over would-be voters with calm authority, displaying instead flaming passion. Passion for Remain. When his party is only standing candidates in a nation that voted to Leave. And he turned the air blue when he said “pussy” on air an hour before the watershed, in relation to Trumpaposs infamous comments grabbing women.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen I was a kid, I was convinced I was going to be a star, because I was always told I was good in the village productions. And why wouldn’t I be a star  I was  years old, and my brother Chris, then , had been considered talented too, and look what he’d achieved. He was in Coldplay. And really, really famous. I’m the youngest and Chris is the oldest. Our second-oldest brother, Al, is an architect, our sister, Rosie, is a nurse and our other brother, Richard, is in the Army. I’m an actor and my parents say all their children are ‘working towards their potential’. I have two side jobs too, just to keep a bit of money coming in: I’m a kids’-party entertainer and transcribe interviews for people. Of course, my surname is Martin, but I changed it to Wren – after a Pizza Express pizza I’m fond of – when I started acting. There was another Nicola Martin on the acting directory, and I also had this fear people would think, ‘Oh, it’ll be easy for her – Chris can get her work.’ I wanted to do it for myself. As the youngest of five kids, all I ever wanted was for my siblings to think I was fab at everything I did. That’s maybe why I secretly want to be a bit famous – it’s love and validation. But anyone with lots of siblings will know what it feels like to grow up in someone’s shadow, Coldplay or no Coldplay.  There’s always a favourite – although I don’t actually think Chris is the favourite in our family! Growing up, I knew he was talented and, because we had the biggest age gap, there was less rivalry between us. He’d make up silly songs about me and my pet gerbils, and send me funny postcards when he went away. He was my hero and I just absolutely adored him. I was eight when Coldplay got together, and  when Chris met Gwyneth Paltrow. That’s when things got a lot bigger for him.  I was doing quite a bit of acting and thought I was the big cheese of the village. I’d landed the part of Mole in The Wind In The Willows and believed it was my big moment. I was peeping through the curtain and, just as the show started, I saw two people sneak in wearing caps. I realised it was Chris, with this woman I’d met a few weeks earlier backstage at a Coldplay concert. I remember other people being really excited, but the name Gwyneth Paltrow meant nothing to me at my age. I didn’t know she’d appeared in Shakespeare In Love and I genuinely thought, ‘Yeah, she acts, but I bet she never played Mole.’  After the show, I ran backstage, ready for my praise and Chris and Gwyneth were there, surrounded by people, with everyone wanting photos and autographs. I was really confused – why didn’t anyone want my autograph ! In hindsight, I realise that was when I changed from being the deluded little girl who thought she was a huge star to being seen as Chris Martin’s little sister. When Coldplay first started getting big, Chris would say to me, ‘Let’s go out and get recognised!’ It was a fun game we liked to play because it was only ever fans of the band and only a few people. But when Gwyneth arrived it was a totally dferent type of recognition. Paparazzi would wait outside our house and hide in our garden. That wasn’t very nice.  My parents explained I wasn’t to speak to them as they were sneaky. That’s when I realised I didn’t really know who to trust and I started not wanting people knowing Chris was my brother. Chris and Gwyneth lived in London together, but they’d come to the village for Christmas. After my niece, Apple, was born, the press would be waiting outside trying to get a glimpse. Although I wanted to be an actor, I didn’t see Gwyneth as a big star. All I cared about was that she was my brother’s cool girlfriend who showed me affection and was so kind to me. She was awesome. I went to boarding school a year after they met and I tried not to tell anyone Chris was my brother.  Only I was so homesick, she called and spoke to me every single day. We were really close and especially as a younger sister, when your older brother has a cool girlfriend, you love them. I remember in Home Economics we were making woolly hats and I made two. One for Gwyneth and one for my other brother’s girlfriend at the time. I gave it to Gwyneth and remember thinking, ‘I bet she’s going to get papped wearing that hat.’ I never saw her wear it! It was a shit hat, but I’d done her favourite colours. She was very appreciative and sweet when I gave it to her though. Despite the mega-fame in Chris’s le, the rest of the family all lived normally.  I graduated from drama school and went over to LA to visit him. Gwyneth said she’d take me to the Golden Globes. She helped me pick a dress and get ready, and that was the first time I thought, ‘This is absolutely mental.’ There were brilliant actors all around me and I was thinking, ‘When I get home, I’m back to working in a pub.’ People assume I have a lavish lestyle and Chris bankrolls me, but I’d never ask him for anything – he has his own family. We were always taught the value of money. I needed a new bike recently and some friends said, ‘Can’t Chris pay for it ’ No. It’s nice to save up and buy things yourself. But I’m fortunate thatI was down on my luck, I have people who can help.  My dating le has been tricky with a famous brother. A boy dumped me because he was in a band and was worried people would think he was using me to get to Chris. That was really hard for  him , apparently! I broke up with someone recently in the pub and my brother’s song  The Hardest Part  was playing. And, sometimes, I’ll beon a date, snogging, and a Coldplay song will come on. It’s too weird! Of course, there’s part of me that loves it, becausesomeone dumps me, at least they’ll think about me loads afterwards because they’ll hear Coldplay wherever they go!  I used to pretend I hated the band, as I thought that was cooler, but I’m not afraid to admit I love them now. Their music gives me great comfort and I like taking my friends to their gigs, as they’re brilliant live.

The little girl was then referred to North Tees Hospital, near the family’s home in Stockton-on-Tees.She spent five days there, before eventually being diagnosed with a chronic kidney infection, and discharged. ‘I just wanted to get her home for Christmas,’ says Lynsay, also mum to Oscar, now nine.‘She was fine for a few days and then her health plummeted – her legs, feet and fingers began to swell and her lips went blue. ‘Andrew took her to the park and she vomited everywhere. We knew something wasn’t right.’ Lynsay went back to hospital, where Evie was given an ultrasound.‘A doctor came out and said, “Do you want to wait for your husband ” but I never dreamed it would be anything serious so I said, “No, just tell me now.”‘He explained that while he wasn’t a paediatric expert, they had found a mass around Evie’s tummy and wanted us to be transferred to specialists at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. ‘Andrew met us at the bigger hospital – we knew it was more serious, but I still wasn’t thinking about cancer.‘Even when we went to meet an oncology consultant, I wasn’t panicking because I honestly didn’t know what the word meant. ‘The first time we realised it was cancer was when a doctor came in the room and said, “I’m going to take a biopsy of Evie’s tumour.”‘What – she had a tumour  Andrew and I just looked at each other in shock.’ The couple were soon ushered into a room full of dferent medical people – consultants, nurses, anaesthetists – and were told the devastating news: Evie had stage  neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a very rare childhood cancer that affects only about  children a year in the UK. ‘I was in complete shock,’ recalls Lynsay.‘I said to the doctor: “Are you telling me my daughter has cancer ” he replied: “I’m not just telling you she has cancer, I’m telling you she has the beast of childhood cancers.” Those were his exact words.‘Andrew burst into tears, but I couldn’t take it in, I just held his hand feeling gutted, totally heartbroken.’ It was on  December  when that devastating diagnosis was confirmed: Evie had a cm tumour – the most aggressive kind – which was wrapped around her main artery.The disease had also spread to her bones. Knowing staff would be short for the festive season, doctors moved quickly.  On Christmas Eve, the poorly toddler began her first, gruelling round of chemotherapy. ‘It was only when Evie had her line to receive her chemotherapy fitted into her little body that the enormity of the situation finally sank in,’ admits Lynsay. ‘I let out some noise that Andrew tells me was like a shriek and I fell to the floor. It was like the world had stopped.‘But somehow we dragged ourselves through Christmas, trying to put on brave faces to watch Oscar open his presents.‘Evie was too poorly to care about gts.’ Unbelievably traumaticThe next year went in a blur of treatment and surgery. Evie was put on a -day cycle of dferent chemotherapy drugs for  days to target the disease in her bones.Then she had the tumour surgically removed, a stem cell harvest, high intensity chemotherapy with stem cell replacement, and radiotherapy every day for three weeks.She was also put on a clinical trial for immunotherapy, designed to kill the bad cells while protecting the healthy ones for a further six months. ‘It was unbelievably traumatic. If Evie woke up in a dferent room to the one she went to sleep in, orwe weren’t there, she would scream and scream.‘We explained to her that she had a nasty bug in her tummy and the doctors were giving her medicine which would make her feel funny but would make her better in the end.‘We named her feeding tube Tommy and her chemo drips Wally and Dolly, to try and make things less scary for her. ‘She took her beloved Teddy everywhere. ‘When Evie’s blonde curls fell out in lumps, my friend who is a hairdresser came and cut it into a bob for her.‘We told her she had superpowers, that’s why her hair had fallen out.  ‘Her big brother, Oscar, was so sweet when he came to the hospital, he would make friends with the other children on the ward and be so protective of her. ‘There were times when I was terried she might die, but I just willed her to be better and wouldn’t allow myself to think the worst. ‘We put on a brave face at home for Oscar, but when I was in bed I would cry and cry and my heart would be racing with the anxiety and stress.‘I just had to focus on the next part of the treatment.‘In between we tried to do nice things – we took her to The Lion King in London as a treat, and we went camping in the Lake District.’ Lynsay gave up teaching swimming to be with Evie full time, Andrew cut down his hours as a project engineer, and Lynsay’s sister would take care of Oscar when both parents had to be at hospital. Our best Christmas Finally, in March , after more than two years of treatment, the family received the news they had been longing to hear: Evie was cancer-free and in remission.To mark the momentous occasion, the hospital have a special ‘end of treatment’ bell that children get to ring at the end of their chemotherapy. ‘It was a huge day for us.‘Evie wore a new dress with rainbows on it, and our whole family came to the hospital to watch her ring the bell.‘We all cried buckets. ‘Afterwards, we went to a restaurant in Newcastle where everyone made a fuss of her and had a big party, with Evie getting a knickerbocker glory. ‘She’s two and half years in remission now and living a normal, healthy le.‘She’s in Year One at school, has lots of friends, and her hair has grown back. She loves dancing and drama and riding her bike. ‘This Christmas we will be surrounded by our family at our home – and we are determined to enjoy every second.‘Evie is madly into Barbies and Frozen and can’t wait for Father Christmas to come.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager who watched Coronation Street with her mum only realised she was the victim of abuse when she saw ­Bethany Platt’s harrowing storyline unfold. The girl, , had been physically and emotionally abused by her stepdad for months after his marriage to her mum broke up. But, like Bethany’s older tormentor on TV, the abuser brainwashed her into believing it was acceptable. Slowly, almost episode by episode, the teenager realised what was happening. And she knew – just as actress Lucy Fallon’s character Bethany did – she had to stand up for herself, she had to speak out. Now, after seeing her abuser jailed, the girl says: “Watching the show I started piecing it all together. At first I thought it was normal because he was my stepdad. “I was a similar age to Bethany in the show and it helped me create a picture of what was happening and what could happenI didn’t say something. “I need to tell my story so others are aware, they can relate to it or give someone going through it the courage to speak.” Her stepdad, who cannot be named to protect her anonymity, was jailed last month for more than two years after being convicted of sexual activity with a child family member. He will be on the sex offenders register for  years. The abuse took place two years ago – at the time of the Corrie plot. Actress Lucy, , was humbled to learn her role convinced the girl to go to the police. Lucy, who has played Bethany for five years, said: “It’s overwhelming to hear this young girl has been able to come forward.” The girl’s ordeal ended after she confronted her stepdad in July . She confided in a friend, who rang the girl’s home. Her mum was horried and called her daughter – as she was being driven home by the stepdad. The girl was hysterical and her mother told her to keep the phone on “speaker” mode so that she could hear everything. The mum takes up the story, saying: “When he arrived he was in tears saying, ‘Sorry, I canapost help it’. I told him I never wanted him near the kids again.”  The mum recalls watching Corrie oblivious to the nightmare her girl was going through. She adds: “We’d watch it and I had no idea it was happening to her. It gave her the courage to confront him and to speak out. I’d been married to him for  years, I was devastated. “Now I hope we never see him again. I’d no idea he was like that. He was playing mental games with her, messaging her, buying her things, groping her. She’s been amazing in reporting him.” The victim, now  and trying to rebuild her le, says her misery began during weekend visits to her stepdad. She says: “It started with him walking in when I was in the bath or as I was getting dressed. He said it was a mistake and it was brushed under the carpet. “I then got constant calls and messages. He started to put his hand on my inner thigh and kissing my neck and shoulders. I told him to stop but he still continued.” The girl’s mum had a breakdown after the marriage split and her ex – much older than her – used this as ammunition. The girl says: “He saidI spoke out I’d be the reason for Mum to have another breakdown. So I kept quiet.” And the abuse went on. The girl says: “He’d buy revealing clothes and repeatedly ask for photos of me wearing them. He also used to buy me alcohol. “I asked, ‘What are your feelings towards me ’ He replied, ‘I love you, but not in a daughter way’. Then he said, ‘It’s okay because most -year-old girls have the mindsets of -year-olds and age doesn’t matter’.”  The girl says that after confronting him he said something along the lines of: “Where do we go from here ” She says that has stuck with her – “and every time I hear those words in my head it makes me feel sick”. The girl gave evidence via video link and went to court to see him jailed last month. Her mum says: “She needed to do that. He had been found guilty and she had been vindicated. “It was a great relief for her that people knew she was telling the truth. It has been hard but she has been so brave.” The girl, due to start counselling in the New Year, adds: “I faced him at sentencing. It’s impossible to explain the emotions I felt. “Although it may seem like it’s over I have suffered mentally and physically. I don’t trust a single soul, I have panic attacks. “My mum has to force me to go to the shops with her. I started to knot my hair and pull it out which is a form of self harm. I did it without knowing. “But now I have the closure I need to move on.” TV star Lucy said: “The storyline was incredibly important to me and it was crucial we got it right and told it with accuracy and care.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA top chef who has made meals for the Queen has shared his secret to cooking bacon to perfection. Jeff Baker, who has more than three decades experience in a professional kitchen, says a lot of people do it wrong and often the fry-up favourite ends up being too greasy. Instead, the tasty treat should be nice and crisp and there is a simple way to achieve this, according to Jeff. The award-winning Michelin-starred cook, who has worked with some of the best in the business, has lted the lid on how to cook bacon the right way. And it involves getting the pan nice and hot, rather than cooking the meat slow and steady. This should create caramelisation – which makes the rashers crispy and creates a punchier flavour. He told the Daily Star: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so. “If the bacon is properly dry cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges. “The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour.” Controversially, Jeff, who is executive development chef for Online butchery retailer Farmison  Co, doesn’t think you should be adding any condiments to your bacon either. He added: “In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is.  Meanwhile, Jeff has also revealed we make a big mistake when cooking curry too. He believes that to make the most of our spices, we should instead apostemperapos them in a pan. This involves heating them in hot oil to intensy the flavours before adding them to the meal. To ‘temper’ your spices means to heat them up in oil to bring out their flavours, he explained.

The cordons either side of the bridge have now been reduced and the roads re-opened. However, the bridge itself currently remains closed. The force initially tweeted that the bridge had reopened, however has since confirmed they are still working to do so.A spokesperson said: has tweeted: The cordons either side of London Bridge have been reduced  roads re-opened.The bridge itself currently remains closed  we are working to re-open it. We will update when this happens. Apologies for any confusion and inconvenience caused. Cordons were put in place after the terror attack, which saw Usman Khan stab five people in Fishmongersapos Hall before being held down by members of the public in nearby London Bridge until police arrived and shot him dead. Two of the victims died following the attack. They have been named as Jack Merritt, , of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire and Saskia Jones, , of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Both were graduates of the University of Cambridge and family liaison officers are supporting their families.  Today tributes and flowers were placed on London Bridge after part of a police cordon and some vehicles were moved. One tribute attached to a photo of Jack placed under a road sign read: I have no words. You were so loved and so needed on this planet. Another card attached to the photo said: It may have taken us a long time to realise we would get on but once we did I could do nothing but adore you for being the wonderful and wholly special human being that you are. You have been a light and rock to so many and we love you.  Both victims were involved in the universityaposs Learning Together programme – Jack as a co-ordinator and Saskia as a volunteer.  Terrorist Usman Khan was on licence and wearing an electronic monitoring tag when he launched his attack as he attended the conference on prisoner rehabilitation hosted by the scheme at Fishmongersapos Hall. The University of Cambridge confirmed two of their graduates had been killed and a third member of staff among the injured.  Professor Stephen Toope, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge released as statement which read: I am devastated to learn that among the victims of the London Bridge attack were staff and alumni of the University of Cambridge, taking part in an event to mark five years of the Learning Together programme. What should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act. I am sad beyond words to report that course coordinator Jack Merritt and former student Saskia Jones were killed. Both were Cambridge graduates.

From the p item to making carpets look as good as new, to popping tumble drier sheets into cushion covers so they smell glorious. And now she has inspired fans to come up with their own innovative home transformation trick – using toilet rolls as curtain spacers. Using the empty rolls, thrty homeowners are spacing them evenly between curtain pleats so they hang perfectly neat and unorm. The first step is to collect a good amount of empty toilet rolls before they are binned. Have at least  to hand. Next, cut them open so you can pull them on and off the curtain pole without having to take the whole thing down. You can also cut the rolls to the size you want the pleats to be spaced out.  Then place a roll between each curtain ring and tape closed so they don’t fall off every time you open the curtain The process takes minutes and is completely free. Hundreds of people have been copying the idea with fabulous results. One wrote: “Who would have thought a little toilet roll tube would make such a dference to how my curtains look!” Another said: “My mum did the same thing with her new curtains last year.

Little Courtney had been forced to understand the meaning of money – and how it feels to live without it. Hungry and cold, instead of enjoying a carefree childhood she worried about how her family would survive. She says: “Sometimes we slept in our coats because we couldn’t afford the heating. Mum sometimes didn’t have any dinner so me and my brother could eat ours. Or we would go to the foodbank to get food. “It was scary sometimes because I was worrying about money. It would worry me at school, and I wanted to make it better for my mum.” Mum Charlotte had fled abuse and was housed in a three-bedroom flat in Cambridge – one of the most expensive cities in the UK – with Courtney and her brother Nathaniel James, six.Out of work after being diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, the mum-of-two faced a five-week wait for Universal Credit and says she had to live on just £-a-day child benefit.To add insult to injury, she had to find the money to pay bedroom tax – meaning there was little left to feed her young children or keep them warm. Charlotte, , says: “I felt like I was living in third world country, I had so little money. I had to make tough choices between paying to heat the flat, or buying food for the kids. “I’d get down to my last few pence and have nowhere to turn. Sometimes I’d go without food to make sure the kids ate – they always came first. “A lot of people are just one crisis away from living below the breadline. “We were OK before I had to move. The flat in Cambridge had three bedrooms, and I was told my children should be sharing a room, so had to pay an extra £ in bedroom tax. I had to take a loan out to pay for food for Christmas and to pay my rent and bills. I got behind on rent while waiting for my first Universal Credit payment. We had nothing. It was hell.”  That first time at the foodbank, hungry and confused, little Courtney didn’t even know what the place was. She says: “I thought a foodbank is where food came out of a bank – like a hole in the wall where money comes out, but with food in it. It was really weird being there – I didn’t like it. I can’t always get what I want to eat, because Mum doesn’t have that kind of money. But that day I got Pringles and biscuits. I went back there a few times with my mum.” Courtney is one of the . million children growing up in poverty in the UK, where one in three youngsters are living below the breadline. That is are why we are today asking readers to Give Kids a Cracking Christmas as we launch our Christmas appeal for charity Action for Children. Child poverty will surge to a -year highthe Conservatives remain in power, an influential think-tank says. And the country’s biggest foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust, is bracing itself for its busiest December ever, after distributing , emergency food parcels to children last Christmas. Courtney and her family were eventually forced to move to Hull, where Charlotte was able to save more than £-a-month in rent – vital money she needed for food and bills.

Sammy Warnes, , says her nausea was so bad when she was ten weeks pregnant with daughter Arabella, now three, she considered an abortion.Strong medication from her doctor did not work, so she started using cannabis until the symptoms disappeared at  weeks, Wales Online reports.Sammy said her daughter was born fit and healthy, so when she experienced the same nausea with her current pregnancy she began smoking cannabis a few times a week to alleviate the symptoms. Now -weeks pregnant with her second child, she spends £ every three weeks and gets her supply from the internet. The -year-old said she got the idea after she read on an online forum that other mums-to-be used the Class B drug to cure severe morning sickness. Sammy, from Leeds, said: The thing is the prescription drugs do more damage. Thereaposs risk of birth defects so theyaposre quite scary to be fair. One of them was making my body do random movements. That stuff panics me. Itaposs actually saved both me and my babyaposs le. This time round has been ten times worse. Iaposve had to give my job up because I just couldnapost do anything. With just two puffs Iaposm able to be a parent to my daughter. I only do it a few times a week. I can do normal things like go to the shops, take her to nursery and just be a mum.

I wanted to seethere were any old-wives tales or aposold fashioned tipsapos that would help me out. Then I found quite a few forums on women using cannabis to stop their morning sickness. I was so desperate I thought Iaposd give it a go. I was a bit nervous when I first did it but I was reassured by all the things I read on the forums.  I think anyone would be at first. It was to medicate my body, not to get stoned. Iaposm not abusing it or trying to get blazed. Some days I have good days and donapost need it. Other days I am throwing my guts up and need a couple of puffs. I got some a few days later and as soon as I took it the symptoms just went away.  It wasnapost just a case of me feeling sick the whole time. I couldnapost do anything at all. It was amazing - it helped me get out of bed in the morning.  It literally worked straight away. I didnapost tell my midwe as to be honest I didnapost want to cause unnecessary stress.

Iaposve had no choice but to take it. It worked so well last time. This time the sickness was ten times worse and I was considering having a termination.  Despite the taboo surrounding smoking cannabis, Sammy said she has both the support of her friends and family. She said: I smoke it in my back garden in the mornings.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48715702-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48715702-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48715702-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48715702-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"calum butcher signs new deal at dundee united until 2023","story":"Calum Butcher has signed a new deal at Dundee United until .The combative midfielder has extended his stay at Tannadice after an impressive  months since re-joining the club last January.United currently sit top of the Championship and Butcher was delighted to get his future with the Tangerines sorted out.#I am delighted to sign the contract,” he said.“United is a great place to be right now.

I have watched it back a couple of times now and there was nothing in the game.“You get a lot of games like that in this league.

up but Buddies were awarded a penalty with just minutes remaining when Lewis fouled Obika.However, Dons keeper Lewis brilliantly saved Tony Andreu#s spot-kick before recovering quickly to also block Andreu#s second shot after pouncing on the rebound.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes made three changes to the side that dropped points to St Johnstone, the Premiership’s bottom side.Returning to the starting line-up were Zak Vyner, back from a shoulder injury, Dean Campbell and Jon Gallagher.Dropping to the bench were Mikey Devlin, Shay Logan and Curtis Main.Long-serving defender Andy Considine was given a guard of honour by both Aberdeen team-mates and St Mirren in recognition of making his th Dons appearance in the recent - draw at St Johnstone.Aberdeen set up with three at the back and that was nearly exploited inside the opening minute  when a  chipped through ball from Sam Foley picked out Andreu.He chested the ball to take it beyond the back-tracking Jon Gallagher before unleashing a a vicious -yard drive that keeper Joe Lewis blocked.Aberdeen went ahead through goal machine COSGROVE in the sixth minute.The Dons came close in the th minute when Ryan Hedges flighted over a superb cross to the back post that Greg Leigh headed down into Cosgrove#s path.The prolic scorer pulled a shot wide from the edge of the penalty area.The Dons should have netted in the nd minute when Lewis Ferguson met a superb Gallagher cross at the back post.He was completely unmarked but the midfielder#s ing header from eight yards hit the ground and bounced just over the bar.It was a costly miss as St Mirren scored within a minute following great play down the right hand side.Ryan Flynn burst towards the byline then cut the ball back and OBIKA stroked it home.In the final minute of a flat, passive and uninspiring half for the Dons McGinn fired in a shot from  yards that was deflected wide for a corner.Early in the second half Hedges shot from the centre of the penalty area but his effort flashed wide.Aberdeen regained the lead in the th minute when Hedges powered down the left hand side and cut back a cross to McGINN.The Northern Ireland cap took a touch then rled home a clinical -yard finish.Moments later a header from Obika dropped just inches wide of the far post.St Mirren were awarded a penalty in the th minute when a long ball over the top caught the defence flat to find Obika.He took a touch to take him towards goal but was taken down by keeper Lewis for a penalty. Greg Leigh perhaps spared Lewis being red carded as he was there to potentially make the challenge.Lewis redeemed himself with a brilliant double save,First he blocked Andreu#s initial spot kick which was drilled low with his right foot.Andreu pounced on the rebound to shoot again but Lewis blocked that as well to secure the three points.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Considine, McKenna, Leigh, Ferguson, Campbell, Gallagher, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Logan , McLennan , Main Subs not used: Cerny, Devlin, Anderson.ST MIRREN: Hladky, P.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

The book records fascinating day-to-day detail, with particular focus on the meals enjoyed during the voyage, everything from salmon to grapefruit # only on Sundays # and fried eggs to cold tongue. There are colourful accounts of the weather conditions, meticulous maps of the coastline and photos and descriptions of people and vessels encountered along the way.But by far the biggest event recorded is the weather affected will-she-won#t-she visit of Her Majesty the Queen, at the time just three years into her reign. The Royal Yacht Brittania was battered by south westerly gales, but the Queen still made it ashore on Mull to greet her adoring public, much to the delight of Fulmar#s crew.On a more sombre note, the vessel was at Crinan in August that year when news came of the sad drowning earlier in the week of a fireman from a puffer tied up in Crinan harbour.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun# #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat can be found.Over to you, dear reader."},{"url":null,"title":"green light for lochgilphead front green scheme","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Front Green is to be given a make-over after planning permission was granted for a new play area and picnic space.The development, given the go-ahead by Argyll and Bute Council, will also see new trees planted and a shelter built.The council was behind the plans, which were designed with the help of Glasgow-based architects Erz Limited.A handling report compiled by a council planning officer said the site comprised more than a hectare of public open amenity space and that the proposals should be granted.The report said: #The proposed development will, by reason of plan layout, modest built interventions, scale, design and materiality, conserve and enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.#[It will also] respect the setting and historic and architectural character of the listed buildings on the northern side of Poltalloch Street and Colchester Square.#Any concerns with regard to matters of highway safety and the free flow of traffic on the A trunk road and local authority adopted roads are limited to proposed localised changes to the carriageway surface.#The proposal shows resurfacing the trunk road carriageway at three locations adjacent to the north of the front green with buff coloured aggregate chippings.#These are to enhance the sense of connection between the foot of Argyll Street and Colchester Square with the front green and to accentuate the entrance to the public car park off Poltalloch Street.#It is also proposed to do the same to a section of the local authority adopted road at the southern end of Colchester Square at the roundabout junction with the A.#Subject to the planning conditions recommended herein, it is considered the proposed development is acceptable.#"},{"url":null,"title":"convivial construction in achnamara as skiff takes shape","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowConstruction work began in October  inside a former Forestry Commission shed.As their boat takes shape, volunteers at the Achnamara skf project are happily working away, finding time wherever they can to contribute to the effort.The St Ayles skf was purchased as a kit, thanks to lottery funding and money raised locally.

It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L. McMillan, have set up a processing plant in the former slaughterhouse buildings, and are employing, at present, three people.Operating under the name Davaar Seafoods, they are consigning to Aberdeen an average of  stones of processed scallops per day. This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F. Machrihanish.The #bus loads of senior citizens were welcomed at the airport by Squadron Leader A. N. McGlashan, on behalf of the station Commanding Officer.Founder member of the club, Mrs M. McKinlay of Stewarton, pressed the button which set off the magnicent fireworks display and bonfire.The station youth group served hot soup and sausage rolls to the visitors and attended to the comfort of the old people.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOth Argylls cadre homeThe cadre of the  th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, consisting of  men and  officers, under command of Major A. Lockie, which left France on Sunday, arrived at the headquarters of the battalion at Dunoon about mid-day on Monday.They were given a hearty welcome when they landed at Dunoon, the Provost, Magistrates and Town Council receiving them officially.Maclachlan of Maclachlan, convener of the county, Colonel H. Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

The children will also learn about fire safety to keep humans and animals safe.Meghan, from Dunbar, was awarded a posthumous First Class Honours degree from Edinburgh Napier University, where she was studying veterinary nursing, following her death in December .In a statement, her mum and dad said: ldquoWe remember Meghan talking about meeting Lesley and how excited she was about the prospect of being involved with Fostering Compassion. The workshop is such a lovely way to keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Each Fostering Compassion workshop includes the donation of lsquogts of compassionrsquo from the children to animals in need.Through the Animal Heroes workshops, funds will be raised to donate Smokey Paws oxygen mask kits, used by firefighters to resuscitate animals pulled from fires, to each of the  fire stations in the Lothians, Borders and Fe, which do not yet have them.These gts help encourage compassion and empathy in the children and at the same time, with the blessing of her family, will help keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Miss Winton added: ldquoMeghan was also a firm believer of lsquorandom acts of kindnessrsquo and created the lsquoWishing Treersquo in Pressmennan Woods in East Lothian where she hung inspirational messages full of hope and love. Both these gestures and activities will be incorporated in the workshop and the children will be encouraged to continue them at home to build on positive behavioural changes as a result of attending the Fostering Compassion activities.ldquoThe idea of the Animal Heroes workshop came to me almost four years ago around the time Meghanrsquos and my paths first crossed and she put me in touch with her father. After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

Itrsquos nice to know people still think of me. But is it a good show  Have you seen it I have and itrsquos a great tribute, Stanley. It will bring back so many great memories. There are clips flashing back to early BBC Scotland shows in the s, great archive footage, and, of course, it features that very handsome journalist who has written your biography.ldquoYes, thatrsquos wonderful, he says, in soft, but delighted voice that reveals a delicious hint of sarcasm. ldquoAnd Irsquom sure television will be kind to you.But all is not entirely wonderful. It transpires that the Glasgow-born legend has actually seen the programme. The production team sent over an advance copy a couple of weeks back. ldquoIrsquove seen it  he says, a little taken aback. ldquoOh, dear. The memory isnrsquot quite what it was.Yet his sense of humour hasnrsquot abated. And his -year-old blue eyes still twinkle. ldquoWell, at least Irsquoll be able to watch it again for the first time, he says, smiling.Wersquore at Baxterrsquos home in North London, in the same street where George Michael and Sir Yehudi Menuhin lived. His living room contains his three Baftas and some lovely oil paintings, and his leather sofa is as inviting as the man himself.But for the past  years chats have taken place upstairs, in another living room. Baxter is now confined to the lower floor even the power of the StairMaster is not strong enough to deal with the complications of having him hoisted in and out.Whatrsquos wrong with him  In a sense, nothing specic his back and hips wonrsquot propel him along the way he moved when recording Busby Berkeley-like dance numbers, as featured in his LWT spectaculars, while playing James Cagney or Ethel Merman.A few years back he had a stent fitted. Baxter had blacked out while on holiday at his villa in Cyprus and awoke to find ldquoa Hattie Jacques-lookalike nurse with a huge bosom standing over me. I thought Irsquod died and woken up in a Carry On film hospital.Hersquos also had two knee replacements and his spine is more worn than his all-time favourite biography .But, in reality, his aches and pains havenrsquot really prevented him from leaving his house for the past two years. What has most likely happened is that Stanley Livingstone Baxter stopped going out when he felt he could no longer play the part of the cheery, vibrant ex-TV star. Baxter once loved his strolls around Highgate Village and the comments from the fans and little old ladies who would delight in his chats, during which he would slip into characters such as Joyce Grenfell and Margaret Rutherford, sometimes without realising he had done so.Andyou stop going out, exercising, your body begins to forget it once danced. Yet, while the short memory is a little looser these days, hersquos still very funny, still sharp. I tell him I interviewed Lulu recently. And she was asking after you, Stanley. ldquoWhat  Lulu  he says, a little surprised, then has a flashback moment. ldquoYes, we almost appeared in panto.Yes, until you changed your mind at the last minute, Stanley. But she still thinks yoursquore great. Have a look at the video message she made for you. And he listens and grins as Lulu gushes about how much she loves the comedy star. ldquoShersquos very Scottish now, he says, grinning. ldquoDoes she always speak like that  Perhaps shersquos cranked up the Dennistoun accent just for you. ldquoThat was very kind of her, he deadpans.He adds, in more serious voice. ldquoI havenrsquot seen her since she lived along the road but I canrsquot remember when that was.While Stanley Baxter is a little forgetful these days, Scotland has become a little forgetful of the magnitude of the manrsquos talent, the performer of whom Billy Connolly said, \"Stanley Baxter is a genius. I came to London because of Stanley Baxter.\"Baxter, as the new programme reveals, came to London in , realising the writing was on the wall for iety theatre in Scotland. In any case, he had guessed the potential of television. ldquoI knew I could pull the faces and do the voices, and I sensed the closeness of TV would work for me.Within months of arriving in North London, Baxter, who grew up in Glasgowrsquos West End, just a few hundred yards from BBC Scotland, was appearing in comedy review series On The Bright Side, alongside bright young things such as Una Stubbs and Ronnie Barker.Baxter never looked back. Years later hersquodto Scotland to star in panto in Glasgow and Edinburgh, but television and films such as Very Important Person, alongside the likes of James Robertson Justice and Julie Christie made him a celebrity across Britain.However, the Channel  show takes audiences way back into Baxterrsquos early le. It takes us into the flat he grew up in and talks of his motherrsquos determination to hothouse a little star. Little Stanley didnrsquot disappoint. ldquoI think he is someone who pirouetted out of the womb, says actor-fan Miriam Margolyes.Baxter had fallen in love with cinema almost out of necessity. At Hillhead School he didnrsquot find too much in common with his classmates. And he wasnrsquot overly caught up with their choice of films either. Flash Gordonrsquos ray gun didnrsquot excite him at all, although he liked the camp outfits. Young Stanley, however, did get excited watching adult melodramas such as Dodsworth and musicals such as Meet Me in St Louis.Those memories at the Grosvenor in Byres Road or the Ascot in Anniesland later re-emerged as brilliant television pastiches which are revealed in this show.The programme also rewinds on Baxterrsquos National Service stint, offering an opportunity to show lots of great film and TV clips of the actor in unorm, playing stf upper-lipped sorts to ordinary soldiers. Yet, the truth is Baxter, who had become a radio star at , never fought anything other than boredom during his National Service. ldquoI enjoyed the marching, he says, smiling. ldquoItrsquos all choreography. But when I was sent to Burma le was so boring I considered shooting himself with my rle.Thankfully, however, Combined Services Entertainments was formed and he joined the troupe of performers who staged shows in the Far East, which proved to be ldquothe most wonderful time. Baxter met up with new friends such as Kenneth Williams, John Schlesinger and Peter Nichols, and the quarter set about entertaining the troops, but mostly themselves.Baxter and Williams became great friends. But while they never fought the Germans ndash the war was long over ndash itrsquos also fair to say they often fought for the same air space. Both loved and needed to be the centre of attention.However, the mood in the room turns dark as Baxter reveals that histo Civvy Street was almost unbearable. ldquoI felt like cutting my wrists, he says, in slightly melodramatic voice that hints at the depression he felt.But eventually he found his way into the Citizens Theatre, where within two years he was writing a hit pantomime review show, The Tintock Cup, which ran for six months. Baxter then moved to commercial theatre, starred in iety with the Half Past Eight Shows at the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow. Comedian and writer Barry Cryer says one of few Scots he ever wrote for at the time was Stanley Baxter. ldquoStanley easily transferred to England because he wasnrsquot just a Scots comedian. He was a comic actor who could become whoever he chose to be.He chose to become a film star. The Evening Standard reported that \"Stanley Baxter is the new Peter Sellers.\"ldquoWhat fools, says the man himself now with a self-deprecating shrug.Baxter made five films but never became a movie legend. His light comedy films were made to seem silly alongside the gritty kitchen sinkers of the period, such as Billy Liar.He ed to television, however, and made series after series, he made one-off specials, capturing the social mores of the period. And what wersquove forgotten is that the Scot was incredibly risque. ldquoI was a bit cheeky, he says, grinning. Cheeky  Try subversive. Somehow, he managed to slip in sketches that referenced homosexuality, lesbian love affairs and even the odd nod to bestiality.He even managed one outrageous parody of Upstairs Downstairs . \"Remember the night I came to you and told you the old queen had gone \" says Upstairs Downstairsrsquo maid Rose, to Mrs Bridges the cook. \"Yes,\" blusters Mrs Bridges. \"And I told you not to speak so disrespectfully of Mr Hudson.\"He had one LWT sketch in which private eye Philip Marlowe tries to solve the Cinderella mystery of the prince and the glass slipper, which ends with Marlowe and the Prince having a gay affair.And, of course, Baxter never shied away from becoming the Queen, with whom he shared a birth year.But the Channel  programme also shows that Baxter was the master of his own undoing, in terms of the TV he made. ldquoI grew up dreaming of Hollywood and fantastic productions. And so when I began to do pastiches I wanted them to be so perfect I had to create every idea. And they cost a fortune. And so TV companies kept sacking me.The tribute to Stanley Baxter also covers an area of Baxterrsquos le that he hasnrsquot discussed in the past, his seeming reclusiveness. Channel  has uncovered a clip that opens with a shot of the Houses of Parliament and a very posh, pin-stripe-suited gent on the phone. \"Stanley Baxter  No, Irsquom afraid not,\" he says. \"Donrsquot you know hersquos a recluse  Even his agent hasnrsquot seen him for months. Someone thought they saw him in New York wearing a floppy hat and dark glasses, but it turned out to be Greta Garbo.\"Was Stanley Baxter a recluse  Therersquos no doubt he avoided showbiz parties the way he avoided the nit-haired boy next to him in class. His mind was closed to West End theatrersquos opening nights but itrsquos entirely wrong to say he locked the front door from the inside.In recent years, Saturday afternoons saw him at the movies in north London, near his home.

But perhaps even that would be a risk that Dominic Cummings and Tory advisers would be willing to take. After all, those who have agreed to an Andrew Neil interview in this election campaign have found it an unforgiving experience.First up was Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister is an accomplished media performer ndash easily the most competent politician in front of a camera in Scotland, and surely in the top ten across the UK.Her interview wasnrsquot quite the car crash that social media would perhaps suggest, but it was certainly a deeply uncomfortable  minutes.Her wild assertions about how easily an independent Scotland could stroll into the EU were ruthlessly exposed, and she may come to regret describing the SNPrsquos currency tribulations as a lsquojourneyrsquo.The -second-long list of problems facing the NHS under the Nationalists also deserved the million-plus audience it has since received online. Yet at times the First Minister held her own and, realistically, her performance is unlikely to cost the SNP many votes.However, it might help some Labour left-wingers in England understand why their Scottish colleagues get so angry when they describe Ms Sturgeon as a comrade.Predictably, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, fared far worse in his own interview. Thoroughly displeased at being there, he repeatedly struggled to explain how he would pay for his manesto promises.Then, with voters screaming lsquojust apologisersquo at their TV sets, he refused four times to say sorry for the anti-semitism shaming his leadership.If heads were in their hands at Labour HQ, the verdict in Tory HQ will have been lsquowellhellip sod thatrsquo.The Andrew Neil interviews have given voters some food for thought, as these set-piece TV events should.The ITV head-to-head between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn has been the only major let-down so far, with a bizarre format which gave neither politician enough time to answer the questions. On this occasion, the victors were those not invited ndash Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon. With hindsight, perhaps they should have saved their parties from the huge legal bill of trying to get on the line-up.In contrast, the winners in Thursday nightrsquos climate change debate were those who did appear, with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage reduced to ice sculptures for not showing up.When it comes to how much impact these debates have on the final election result, the jury is out ndash Cleggmania in  didnrsquot really translate to Commons seats.But Electoral Reform Society research has found that  per cent of people believe debates are important, and a third say theyre key to helping them decide how to vote.They want to see points put across clearly, factual evidence for claims, and a debate that engages the audience watching at home. And as well as being watched by millions, they certainly set the campaign narrative.In , Alistair Darling bested Alex Salmond in the first TV debate of the independence campaign. If you canrsquot remember it, Mr Salmond decided to ask questions about alien attacks, while Mr Darling pointed out that an eight-year-old could name their countryrsquos capital, flag and currency, but Mr Salmond couldnrsquot say what currency an independent Scotland would use.In the  election campaign, I was involved behind-the-scenes in the Scottish TV debates. The amount of preparation work was immense. Days of going over attack lines, defence lines, introductory remarks, key messages, second-guessing opponents, and the occasional bit of role-play.Spin doctors had their own role to play on the night as well. The first debate on the BBC involved a nurse telling Ms Sturgeon to her face that NHS staff were having to use foodbanks. While journalists in the spin room tried to file their copy, political advisers interrupted them, talking up their own employer to some extent, but mainly talking down the rest of the line-up.For the SNP, this backfired when the message was spread that the nursersquos husband was a Tory councillor. It categorically wasnrsquot true.However, the Nationalists had a better night of it at the STV debate. Unusually, the broadcaster decided not to provide inidual green rooms for the politicians, so they all had to share the same space for a long time before taking to the stage.Willie Rennie and Ruth Davidson dealt with this through humour, cracking jokes to demonstrate confidence. Kez Dugdale, who I was working for, focused on her notes. Nicola Sturgeon kept herself to herself. She had something up her sleeve.In the debate, she claimed that Kez once told her in a private conversation in the aftermath of Brexit that Labour might rethink its opposition to an independence referendum ndash something she strongly denied. But having run a campaign focused on opposition to independence, this was a lsquogotcharsquo moment. It was, comfortably, the toughest moment of the campaign.So I wish my successors at Scottish Labour, and at all parties, every good fortune for the coming days.This campaign still has nearly a fortnight to run. The Scottish TV debates have yet to be broadcast, there is another Prime Ministerial head-to-head to come, and it remains to be seenBoris Johnson will sit down with Andrew Neil.There are a lot of nervous politicians, and a lot of nervous spin doctors. They have a right to be nervous, because the voters deserve more honest answers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10737437.jpg?type=article-full","title":"apple-day-scotland-needs-orchards","story":"John Hancox, director of Scottish Fruit trees, said that it was essential to ensure that fruit trees were planted as they would make a dferent to the economy and boost carbon capture.Hancox said: \"The enthusiastic election pledges of tree planting by all the political parties is great news, and I think they have realised that this a practical way in which people can make a dference in terms of carbon capture, and wider benefits to the environment.\"Fruit trees do all that - but much more.

Today, all that has changed, and folk skip to their workplaces with a song in their heart and joy beaming from every orice.Admittedly, I write with an unfathomable degree of ignorance, as my workplace is ma hoose and I havenrsquot laboured in an office for years. But I like to imagine people are happier there, with all the human solidarity and merry banter, eventhey cannot go out at any time and stand among the trees or feed the birds, as I do when my brain gets tired from too many words jostling for expression.I express myself thus in the wake of two peculiar news stories that caught my eye this week. They relate to the idea that employers care about the welfare of their workers. They look after them.The controversial BBC, a broadcasting organisation, was the first employer to hit the headlines, after the corporation allegedly initiated a ldquosix-chip rule in its canteen. Kitchen staff at Broadcasting House were witnessed counting out the comestibles to ensure nobody got more than their quota.Presumably, the sinister corporation had staff welfare in mind. Many people today are blobs, which is bad for the health .Although the BBC decried the six-chip rule as fake news, with its press office sharing a picture of a plate containing  chips, employees took to Twitter to confirm six chips was the case. One said there was ldquouproar about it. Another called for a popular uprising. Another said: ldquoThe staff seemed shocked that I didnrsquot go with the unlimited couscous instead.My researchers tell me couscous consists of steamed balls of semolina, which I can hardly believe.To make matters worse, employees in Salford, in Englandrsquos north, boasted that they were allowed  chips, presumably as a sop to local sensitivities.Further north, meanwhile, I could hardly believe my ears when I read a story about office workers in Edinburgh getting a self-service alcohol area. I rarely use my ears to read, and thought they might have been mistaken but, no, there it was was in black and, arguably, white: councillors had approved a plan by We Work Community Workspace for a sixth-floor area dedicated to bibulous relaxation.We Work seems to be a provider of office space rather than an employer as such but, still, it clearly has the welfare of workers in mind.Mind you, the daily four-drink limit here would put topers over the Governmentrsquos allowable weekly units. Not that I want to sound censorious. My doctor has said with regard to my weekly units: ldquoLetrsquos take it gradually and, as a first step, try to get it down to double figures.Itrsquos just that Irsquom surprised. Every day, wersquore told booze is bad and drinkers will burn in hell. But perhaps these Edinburgh pioneers believe the odd tipple can be good for morale, as well as acting as an aid to sleep after lunch. Truth to tell, I never drink when working, preferring to wait until Irsquom finished at around pm.In the meantime, is it possible that employers and office providers have gone too far in pandering to our desires  Should daily beatings be re-introduced  Should the workplace once more become a place of humiliation and discipline  I believe so. But, then, it doesnrsquot affect me.Going greenPERHAPS,employers really care about their staff, they will introduce the latest healthy condiment in their canteens hellip Brussels sprout ketchup.The pound bottles, spearheaded by online retailer Amazon, are described as a ldquoparticularly welcome addition to the dining table, perhaps with particular applications to sandwiches and dips. Thank heavens, no one has mentioned it in relation to chips because the BBC would probably smear it on their staffrsquos half-dozen for the good of their health.The product is being launched on Monday with the aim of spoiling peoplersquos Christmas. However, an Amazon spokesman insisted: ldquoWersquore sure that this delicious ketchup will change the minds of some of the humble sproutrsquos harsher critics.Yes, dream on, mate. One of many odd aspects to this dangerous development is that, like most decent ratepayers, when forced to eat sprouts, I drown them in broon sauce. Surely, we would not be expected to splodge sprout sauce on our sprouts to make them vaguely edible To be fair, the new concoction is blended with cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon to disguise the disgraceful taste, but even just knowing that the evil little brassica is in there somewhere will put off many discerning diners.Presents and incorrectCHRISTMAS news, and an announcement that Satan ndashI have the name right ndash will be too busy to come doon the chimney this year has sparked consternation among the lieges of a small Nottinghamshire town.The announcement was made by Mayor Christine Jeffreys, who warned children that the shadowy figures they might see bearing presents in the middle of the night will probably be their parents.The intelligence was conveyed to the peasantry at a ceremony in West Bridgford to switch on the Christmas lights. Needless to say, a hullabaloo ensued. People booed and Mrs Jeffreys was called ldquoa Grinch.Reading between the lines, though, one feels sorry for the hapless mayor. She was merely making up a well-meaning explanation to children who might see their folks delivering the goods and conclude that Santa ndash got it my apologies ndash Claus didnrsquot exist.Her whole point, I believe, was to show that he did, as science has proved. It was just that he was awful busy, with hundreds of millions of hooses to cover in just a few hours.Mrs Jeffreys has been left ldquoabsolutely devastated by the outcry, and is expected to come out of hiding some time in the middle of next year."},{"url":null,"title":"life-age-disinformation","story":"EVERY day now the truth takes a battering. It seems that barely  hours goes past without another example of disinformation poisoning public discourse.Just look at a few recent examples:bull The Conservative Party rebranded one of its social media accounts as a fact-checking site.bull The Conservatives set up a fake website pretending to contain Labourrsquos manesto when it was actually a vehicle for Tory talking points.bull The LibDems distributed fake newspapers with names similar to real publications.bull The SNP was prevented from distributing a leaflet about Jo Swinson on the grounds a statement in it was  in substance, materially inaccurate and defamatory.bull Labour Party members are pushing  anti-Semitic tropes. Conservatives are pushing  Islamophobic tropes.bull In American, Republicans are claiming Ukraine not Russia interfered in the  US presidential election. Itrsquos a lie propagated by Russian intelligence.bull The Conservative Party doctored a video of Labourrsquos Keir Starmer to make it look ashe was dithering over Brexit.The list could go on hellip and on. On the evidence, from a UK perspective, the Conservatives are by far the worst offenders. Disinformation now seems to be integral to the partyrsquos election strategy. The Conservatives have just issued candidates with guidance on how to discredit rivals using misleading claims, like accusing LibDems of pushing sex work as a career for schoolchildren.Internationally, we know America is soaked in fake news. The President lies daily. But this is a global problem and it affects all political parties. Disinformation is everywhere ndash Indonesia, Hungary, Poland, Italy, France, Russia. In Australia, across Africa, throughout Latin America and Asia.Our world is now one where reality has been undermined, where politicians have manipulated the truth to such an extent that itrsquos hard to know what to believe anymore.How did we get here  Fittingly, given that Russia has been blamed for much of the worldrsquos disinformation, the term was coined by Joseph Stalin. Former Romanian spy chief Ion Mihai Pacepa, who defected to America during the Cold War, says Stalin preferred the word \"disinformation\" to the Russian term \"maskirovka\", meaning \"disguise\", because it sounded French. That meant the strategy could be blamed on the west ndash a feat of brilliant disinformation in itself.The Soviets might have formalised the concept but the strategy of lying to onersquos enemy has been around as long as humanity. The Trojan Horse could perhaps be seen as the first use of lies as part of a military strategy.Therersquos a world of dference between misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is the mistaken distribution of hoods ndash like a journalist publishing material which they believe is correct. Early reports linking vaccines to autism are a good example. Disinformation is the deliberate distribution of lies. And at its heart disinformation isnrsquot just about lying, itrsquos about eating away at the very fabric of the truth until the public doubts everything. Itrsquos a corrosive strategy designed to create chaos.Russian interference in American politics is the best example of modern disinformation. So-called troll farms, linked to the Russian state, created social media accounts designed to disrupt American society. One troll farm, the Internet Research Agency , run out of St Petersburg by an associate of Putin, set up accounts both supporting Black Lives Matter, and opposing Black Lives Matter. Troll farms used similar tactics in relation to other isive \"culture war\" issues, and the presidential election.The idea is to sow enough discord and chaos that yoursquore in control and no-one . The outcome for the Kremlin was the deepest isions in US society since the Civil War and victory for a president seemingly more inclined to Russia than Americarsquos traditionally allies. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence in America cited evidence that the IRA ldquostarted to advocate for Trump ldquoas early as December .IRA staff post comments on newspaper websites and social media attacking those deemed targets. When Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered one whistleblower inside the IRA said trolls were told to spread confusion about who was behind his death.Peter Pomerantsev is a Senior Fellow at the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics ndash hersquos also Britainrsquos leading authority on disinformation, and the author of the new book This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality. He says the goal of Russian trolls was ldquoto make Americans hate each other. Thousands of fake accounts posed as either ldquoright-nationalist, gun-loving Americans who supported the election of Donald Trump or ldquoblack civil rights campaigners who promoted the idea that his rivals werenrsquot worth voting for. Their posts were shared by more than  million Americans.Some analysts believe the world will look back on Russiarsquos cyber activity in decades to come and see it as the greatest intelligence operation ever conducted. Russia isnrsquot some rogue state when it comes to disinformation, itrsquos just the best ndash using it to settle old scores from the loss of the Cold War. The US ran fake online accounts in the Middle East. UK intelligence ran a disinformation campaign to build the case that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.Russia has also interfered in UK politics. The British people will have to wait until after the General Election, however, to read the report into Kremlin meddling as it is being withheld by Johnsonrsquos government.The biggest catalyst for the tsunami of disinformation washing over the world is social media like Facebook, and its unregulated gush of fake news. To Pomerantsev, we live in a world of ldquomass persuasion run amok. Cambridge Analytica is the poster child for this brave new world.ldquoMore information was supposed to mean more freedom to stand up to the powerful, he says, ldquobut itrsquos also given them new ways to crush and silence dissent. More information was supposed to mean a more informed debate, but we seem less capable of deliberation than ever.Disinformation is now systematised and professionalised. Two academics, Dr Jonathan Corpus Ong of Massachusetts University and Dr Jason Cabanes of Leeds University studied what they termed \"the architects of networked disinformation\" in the Philippines. At the top therersquos the chief architects ndash PR firms and advertisers ndash who work for political parties. Then therersquos the paid influencers and at the bottom therersquos the \"fake account operators\" ndash this is what Pomerantsev describes as ldquocall centres full of people ... paid by the hour, with one person manning dozens of social media personas.Such phoney personas repeat messages wersquore all familiar with ndash the media shouldnrsquot be trusted this paper should be boycotted that politician is a traitor. Whether yoursquore in Glasgow or Chicago, the mantra of disinformation is the same and itrsquos designed to shatter trust and sow ision.Just  or so fake accounts can reach millions. Pomerantsev cites one account ndash @Ivan. They posted  times in a week about politics in the Philippines. Previously, they posted about Iran, Syria and Catalonia ndash using Spanish language stories from Russian media.We see similar tactics playing out in the UK over Brexit and Scottish independence. Anonymous accounts target politicians, journalists or public figures ndash maybe for being anti-Brexit or anti-independence ndash and subject them to an onslaught of abuse.Disinformation is all about control, says Pomerantsev. The idea is to ldquosurround audiences with so much cynicism about anybodyrsquos motives, persuade them that behind every seemly benign motivation is a nefarious,impossible to prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative hellip The end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything.In Mexico, phoney accounts infiltrated the online world of anti-government protestors and began manipulating them ndash at one point directing them towards police lines, and spreading fake stories of looting and rioting.These trolls, says Pomerantsev, can ldquocreate the simulation of a climate of opinion, of support or hate. This simulation then becomes reinforced as people mody their behaviour ldquoto fall in line with what they thought was reality. In other words,enough phoney accounts make it seem asa certain person or organisation is bad or dangerous ndash or a certain politician good ndash then eventually that idea goes mainstream. The idea becomes reality, even though itrsquos a lie.Information war is now replacing conventional warfare. The casualties from any war involving the big powers would be unthinkable. But an information war between the east and west costs no lives, and can be even more effective than combat in terms of strategic success. Why spend billions on fighter jets when a few hundred thousand can get you a staff of trolls to undermine your opponent. Janis Berzins of the Latvian Military Academy describes this as ldquoa sht from direct annihilation of the opponent to its inner decay.Sometimes the information war goes hand in hand with conventional war ndash as in Ukraine ndash and sometimes it reaches levels of bizarre absurdity. Pomerantsev tells of pro-Ukrainian online activists putting out  stories that ldquoa battalion of gay fascists from Holland was coming to attack pro-Russian separatists, who panicked when they heard the claims.A lot of online disinformation strategy is designed to make the enemy seem foolish. So many fake news stories come in the shape of memes. The alt-right has made it part of its stock-in-trade to provoke laughter against opponents. Thatrsquos where put-downs like \"snowflake\" and \"libtard\" come from.Therersquos a knowing grin on the faces of many politicians these days too. They donrsquot take their lies seriously anymore. Many defenders of Donald Trump say his critics shouldnrsquot take his lies to heart ndash hersquos only joking. Boris Johnson doesnrsquot face consequences for behaviour which would have finished any political career just a few years ago. This all becomes part of the disinformation feedback loop ndash lies are so ubiquitous that they no longer seem to matter.ldquoWhen Vladimir Putin went on international television during his armyrsquos annexation of Crimea and asserted with a smirk, that there were no Russian soldiers in Crimea, when everyone knew there were, and later, just as casually, admitted that they had been there, he wasnrsquot so much lying in the sense of trying to replace one reality with another as saying that facts donrsquot matter, Pomerantsev explains.In Russia, the public is saturated with disinformation making it impossible to discern whatrsquos true. The state even helped create anti-Kremlin organisations to give it some control over the protest movement. Russians are told Americans developed the Zika virus. If the state addles the public mind enough eventually you can tell people anything and get away with it.So when Kremlin agents attempt to assassinate Sergei Skripal, a double agent who worked for British intelligence, with nerve agent in Salisbury, Russia can claim it was all staged by MI. The truth has been so undermined internationally that even many Brits believed the lie. The same is true of Russian disinformation put out against the White Helmets in Syria ndash volunteers who saved lives after Syrian and Russian air raids.

If we ingest phoney garbage instead of hunting out reputable news sources, then wersquore responsible for the proleration of disinformation.Many of us have retreated into our echo chambers and Twitter bubbles, preferring confirmation bias to information that challenges us. As Pomerantsev says: ldquoItrsquos a lamentable loop: social media drives more polarised behaviour, which leads to demands for more sensationalised content, or plain lies. lsquoFake newsrsquo is a symptom of the way social media is designed.Social media and the ongoing disinformation war have now reached tipping point in terms of damage to the public good. Until recently, political opponents were able to share a common ground over what was or wasnrsquot fact. Dfering sides might disagree on economic or social policy ndash but no-one argued over what constituted an empirical truth. Now, as Michael Gove says, ldquopeople in this country have had enough of experts. Or as Trumprsquos aide Kellyanne Conway claims, therersquos nothing wrong with ldquoalternative facts.Is this why traditional politics has collapsed  Why voters are no longer driven by left-right ideology, but by identity  If everything seems a lie, then maybe you can only trust yourself and others like you. The result of that thinking is to break the world down into two camps ndash us and them. And therein lies the rise of populism which is sweeping the west and imperilling democracy.As the UK parliamentary committee investigating disinformation and fake news found: ldquoWe have always experienced propaganda and politically-aligned bias, which purports to be news, but this activity has taken on new forms and has been hugely magnied by information technology and the ubiquity of social media.ldquoIn this environment, people are able to accept and give credence to information that reinforces their views, no matter how distorted or inaccurate, while dismissing content with which they do not agree as lsquofake newsrsquo.ldquoThis has a polarising effect and reduces the common ground on which reasoned debate, based on objective facts, can take place. Much has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-comings-goings-ups-downs-ins-outs-ooh-missus","story":"The West Coast rail franchise changes hands next Sunday morning, with Avanti ndash Italian for forward and a partnership between the Italian state rail operator Trenitalia and the Aberdeen-based First Group ndash taking over the busiest route in the country from Virgin.

Rosersquos pay, compared to that of head honchos of other banks, was described by the RBS as ldquorestrained. How much does it take to go wild Rose has promised to make the bank more open and inclusive and yadda yadda.

If this could be achieved with independence, the organisation is open-minded to that.Its not just the fishing industry in the north-east that has a stake in the debate.The piers and harbours in areas such as Argyll and Bute also bustle with activity, with Oban styling itself the seafood capital of Scotland.The SNP secured a majority of , there in .Alistair Sinclair, national coordinator of the Scottish Creel Fishermens Federation, represents hundreds of members up and down the west coast and beyond.He described Brexit as a ldquopending nightmare, adding: ldquoWe have major concerns regarding this election.Mr Sinclair said Boris Johnson ldquochanges his mind like the weather, with no guarantees over what the future holds for Scotlands inshore fleet.ldquoWersquore facing an absolute meltdown due to the logistics of the situationthings donrsquot work out well,\" he said.ldquoAnd therersquos no political party giving us any confidence moving forward.

Yet here are signs of what could be the green shoots of recovery for a sector which until recently was deep in crisis.Every day cars turn off the busy bypass road and head towards the farmrsquos cafeacute, The Coo Shed. In a wooden hut dubbed lsquoThe Milk Hoosersquo, a constant stream of newly rinsed milk bottles emerge from visitorsrsquo baskets, bags and bottle carriers, to be filled with creamy, cool and farm-fresh milk straight from a vending machine.ldquoIt has been an eye-opener, says Alison Kerr, who runs South Corton Farm with husband Willy and their children David and Joanne.ldquoWe regularly see people queuing for their milk. They are making the journey to come here for milk. They are using reusable glass bottles and they are enjoying milk which tastes completely dferent from what they are buying in the supermarket.ldquoBut, to be honest, we really had no idea that it would be so successful.The Milkbot vending machine was launched last year. What may have started as something of a novelty addition to their thriving farm cafeacute, is now attracting hordes of visitors, many arriving specically to try the kind of rich, full fat, creamy milk their grandparents took for granted.Usually, theytime and again for refills.Part of its attraction, says Alison, is the milkrsquos lsquoold fashionedrsquo taste. The other is the chance to rewind time to when milk came in bottles, not plastic.ldquoItrsquos non-homogenised pasteurised milk, so the cream settles on the top and it tastes so much better than the milk they are used to, she explains. ldquoPeople arrive with bottle carriers for four or six bottles, they are happily paying pound. a litre which is more than theyrsquod pay in the supermarkets.ldquoThat has been the other surprising element. The dairy industry is being hammered on price but the general public doesnrsquot really noticethey are paying a bit more for their milk.The Ayrshire farm is not the only one to have embraced ato lsquograssrootsrsquo of milk supply. The Kerrs idea was sparked by Forest Farm in Aberdeen, an organic farm and dairy which also sells its fresh milk to glass bottle-carrying customers who,they time it right, can also watch the cows being milked.While at Mossgiel Organic Farm, Mauchline ndash on land which was once farmed by Burns himself ndash is whatrsquos claimed to be the UKrsquos first plastic-free organic dairy. The move to introduce glass-bottled milk sold directly to restaurants, speciality coffee shops and delis and delivered to doorsteps was inspired by desperately low milk prices which left third-generation farmer Bryce Cunningham losing pound, a month.The response has been positive. Production is rising ndash from  litres a week to , litres ndash and the list of customers is growing.Away from the farm, bottled milk, either delivered to homes or picked up in the supermarket, is also on the rise. Grahamrsquos, Scotlandrsquos largest independent milk producer, recently announced plans to offer doorstep deliveries, while householders in some areas of Edinburgh have the choice of at least three milk delivery businesses on their doorsteps.Rising demand for glass-bottled milk and signs that customers are happy to pay a price that reflects the effort required to produce it, is a pleasant twist for a sector which, thrashed by over-supply and a drop in demand, saw an estimated one in five UK dairy farms going out of business in .According to Stuart Martin, manager of the Scottish Dairy Hub, dairy production in Scotland remains in the grip of signicant change.ldquoWe have  dairy herds, which is the least amount of herds there has ever been. The average herd size is  ndash thatrsquos the most itrsquos ever been.ldquoThe breakeven point for dairy farmers average in the UK is about p per litre. Currently in Scotland, the majority are getting less than that, he says. ldquoItrsquos still a very dficult time.Last month a survey of Scottish dairy farmers suggested the dairy industry was tottering on a ldquokne-edge, with producers swinging between low optimism in the short term, yet hopeful of better days further ahead.The research, launched at an AgriScot seminar, showed % of dairy farmers are struggling to feel confident about the dairy industry, with % saying they have ldquono confidence to invest in their businesses in the short term.Meanwhile, Scotlandrsquos milk surplus is said to be on track to rise to more than m litres in  , partly due to a rise in production and partly down to a loss of processing plants such as First Milkrsquos Arran and Mullerrsquos Aberdeen and East Kilbride sites. Last month First Milk also announced the end of its Campbeltown Creamery, home for almost a century to award-winning Mull of Kintyre cheese.Optimism, says Martin, comes from an anticipated rise in global demand for milk products such as baby milk powders, cheese, butter and protein, particularly from China, Japan and Africa. The downside, however, is a lack of Scottish-based processing plants which might take full advantage of emerging markets.While in the background is concern over the rise in the vegan and dairy-free lestyle. Despite the environmental impact of oat, almond and coconut drinks, they are said to have risen % over the past two years while the average personrsquos milk consumption in the UK has fallen % since the s.That has sparked claims that the dairy sector is rapidly losing a marketing war and failed to adequately argue its case.ldquoDairy lacks branding and lacks some real innovative products, concedes Martin. ldquoSupermarkets are huge buildings that sell thousands of litres of milk every day, but unlike other products, customers are buying something that doesnrsquot have a lsquobrandrsquo.ldquoBecause of that the consumer, to an extent, devalues it.Meanwhile, in the dairy heartland of Dumfries and Galloway, David McMiken, an automotive engineering graduate, is the third generation to work the green fields of Ernespie Farm since .A new dairy shed and farm visitor centre launched at the height of the price slump now employs  full time and part-time staff and has his we Rebecca at its helm.Earlier this month his efforts to help consumers re-engage with milk production were rewarded when Ernespie Farm was named Scottish Dairy Farm of the Year.ldquoThere have been tough times for the whole industry and we have had to ride the storm, he says. ldquoBut the balance is starting to come back.ldquoA lot of whatrsquos said about dairy is not strictly true, he adds, pointing to moves to create a carbon zero sector by . ldquoThe dairy sector has a good story to tell but wersquore not getting the chance.ldquoTherersquos a challenge from the vegan movement which we ignore at our peril. However, load by load milk has a better carbon footprint than alternatives, he says.Meanwhile, at the Milk Hoose, queues for milk thatrsquos travelled just a few yards from cow to bottle have encouraged the Kerrs to consider their next step.ldquoWe are now actively looking for another couple of sites for vending machines ndash ideally outside supermarkets, says Alison.ldquoItrsquos like swapping single use plastic bags for reusable ones ndash itrsquos all about changing habits."},{"url":null,"title":"paths-change-people-bringing-urban-walkways-back-life","story":"The name given to the patch of ground at the heart of Paisleyrsquos Ferguslie Park was quaint enough: the village green.It seems appropriate ndash the circle of green space is surrounded by homes, schools, a community centre an ideal place for people to gather, socialise, relax.However the reality, concedes Terry McTernan, was rather less appealing.ldquoIt was a hot spot for anti-social behaviour, he says. ldquoWhen it was dark, people would go there for a drink and theyrsquod set a bin on fire to keep warm.ldquoIt was a dumping ground, where people went when it was dark to drink because no one saw you.ldquoIrsquove lived here for  years and have never seen it a bouncy castle here, a car boot sale. Nothing. No one used it as a community space.Over  years of neglect, the paths leading from the village green were overgrown with weeds. There were no benches to rest and nothing other than dumped rubbish and broken bottles.Today, however, as the result of a remarkable community effort that has had benefits which surely no-one could have foreseen, the village green and its network of paths have been revitalised.The latest phase of regeneration work is now begin following the award of a grant that will enable the often maligned Ferguslie Park community to create access ramps for wheelchairs and prams, to install benches and to complete the challenge to turn what was a village green in name only, into a true public space.The grant, confirmed this week, is among  projects from the Isle of Skye to the Borders to receive a share of pound, by Scotlandrsquos walking charity Paths for All.They include communities with plans to install signs and lighting to make them more accessible to local users, to more adventurous schemes to open long-forgotten areas to a new generation of visitors and to develop tourism.The money will go towards simple tasks such as clearing debris to structural improvements, installing signage and lighting, hiring tools and contractors to help with work, promoting routes and improving bioersity along path networks.At the heart of each project is a powerful community effort to improve the surroundings and bring neighbours closer. As a result, the estimated figure for the community groupsrsquo volunteer in-kind contribution is calculated to be over pound,.At Ferguslie Park, the benefits are said to go far beyond simply tidying up an area so unpleasant that elderly residents are said to pay for a taxi journey to take them around it, rather than cross its few hundred yards by foot.ldquoNo one was holding anyone to account over it, says Mr McTernan, who runs Darkwood Crew, part of Ferguslie Community Council which is dedicated to cleaning up the area.ldquoIt was a downtrodden area, there was no maintenance. Was it any surprise that people were dumping sofas there when no-one appeared to be giving a monkeyrsquos about the area Over the past three years, the Darkwood Crew has spearheaded efforts to rejuvenate the village green.Routes clogged with two decades of weeds have been cleared, events have lured people back to the area and there are plans to create a community orchard and vegetable patches.ldquoIt was a thoroughfare, a dumping ground, adds McTernan. ldquoNow we are seeing people using the paths regularly. Therersquos a mud kitchen for children to play, wersquoll soon have benches and planters so it looks nice and we can use the area for community events which is what it was intended for.ldquoIt has brought the community together.Along with volunteers to carry out path-clearing work came people with pots of soup and plates of sandwiches, he recalls. It grew into a community meal initiative, which sees cans and bottles recycled for cash used to provide meals for  people every week.Meanwhile, in the pipeline are plans for a motorised wheelchair to bring otherwise virtually housebound people outdoors.Similar grants last year helped a group in Coupar Angus buy tools to help cut undergrowth and trim hedges so paths could become more accessible, while Northern Corridor Community Volunteers in North Lanarkshire received pound to reopen a previously unstable path through a golf course. The residents from Gartcosh, Chryston, Moodiesburn, Muirhead and Mount Ellen also installed signposts along the local path networkMeanwhile, volunteers from South Ayrshire Paths Initiative received money to improve an ancient path in the Scottish Wildle Trustrsquos Ayr Gorge Woodlands reserve, rumoured to be the location of Robert Burnsrsquo engagement to Highland Mary.This yearrsquos grant schemes have been funded by Scottish Natural Heritage, Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.Other areas across Scotland are seeing their own benefits. In the Ettrick and Yarrow valley in Selkirk, an old walking route called the Captainrsquos Road which linked the two communities, will finally be restored after being destroyed by forestry.While in Dunblane, a quiet road linking the town with Bridge of Allan and onwards to Stirling which offers cyclists and walkers a safe route away from the A has been granted funding for an upgrade to protect it from erosion.Work will also be carried out by young people under the watch of Kyle of Lochalsh Development Trust to upgrade paths in the area, and in Minginish in the Isle of Skye, a grant will improve access through the construction of a bridge and paths.Meanwhile, in West Fe, a community-driven project will see finishing touches put to a network of paths which have opened up a former country house estate and regenerated interest in the arearsquos once-proud coal mining history.West Fe Woodland Group will use their grant to signpost walkers and cyclists through a -miles circular route linking Valleyfield Woodland Park, Devilla Forest and the Fe Coastal Path.Despite being a stonersquos throw from the Outlanderrsquos tourist hub of Culross, the area was typically bypassed by visitors.ldquoOne objective has been to get people out doing healthy things, walking, cycling, explains the grouprsquos Frank Waterworth. ldquoBut itrsquos also an area of former colliery sites and coal bings which are now covered with trees. Valleyfield Woodland Park was once an old country estate which in February is covered with snowdrops.Ian Findlay CBE, Chief Officer at Paths for All, says: ldquoThere is a growing movement of people choosing to walk or cycle instead of using a car as the public tunes into the benefits this can bring to their health and our shared environments.ldquoWithout care or upgrades, paths can sadly become unsafe, unstable and fall out of use making walking and enjoying the outdoors dficult for many.ldquoImproved paths really build on community spirit as theyrsquore more frequently used by commuters, dog walkers, joggers, children playing and people enjoying the simple but very important pleasure of just going for a walk.Meanwhile, at Ferguslie Park, named in  as Scotlandrsquos most deprived area, the village green is set to finally earn its place at the heart of the community.Soon - for the first time ever ndash it will feature a sparkling Christmas tree entirely made from recycled materials, with old tyres painted to resemble snowmen and festive events for children.ldquoWersquore schemie boys and lassies doing this, therersquos not a paid member of staff among us, adds Mr McTernan.ldquoWe are constantly beaten by a stick and told we are the most deprived place in Scotland but I see real diamonds out there that make this community work.ldquoClearing the paths has brought a sense of community and is meeting needs.ldquoThe real changes here lie in the attitudes of the local people."},{"url":null,"title":"future-scotland-line-general-election-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"On a visit to St Andrews on Saturday, the First Minister said that the decision over whether Boris Johnson or the people living in Scotland should decide the countrys future would have consequences for the long term.Speaking on St Andrews Day, the SNP leader also said that a vote for her party would be a vote to put \"Scotlands future in Scotlands hands\".\"All elections are important - but this one really matters,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\"The future of Scotland is on the line.

The first whisky I had drunk without Coca-Cola for as long as Irsquove been alive, and my eyes, safe to say, were watering. Pungent hits of malt jived with sweet honey flavours, which shot immediately through my nostrils and down to my throat.The taste was deep, musky almost, and I could immediately picture myself smoking a cigar, sat on an armchair by a crackling open fire while I swirled a dram around a tulip-shaped glass. The malt is full, with sweet hints alongside, vaguely reminiscent of vanilla. And it does mix harmoniously with Coca-Cola, much to my delight.This whisky was a lot lighter in colour than others Irsquove seen before - perhaps encouraging my palate to preempt a lighter rum taste. And lighter it certainly was the whisky was super smooth and subtle, giving me vibes of a gust of fresh air on a spring day.The warmth built gradually - tingling my tongue in the process ndash and revealed a medicinal taste. The sensation in my mouth was smoky with a hint of nuts and salt which stuck around for a few minutes after tasting. This whisky comes across as young and excited, keen to experiment and be a bit dferent.The sweet aromas of spices like ginger and nutmeg, combined with citruses such as orange provide a nice and autumnal introduction. It reminded me of celebrating Christingle as a child.But by Jove, despite the ceremonious introduction, Macallan is definitely a strong one. My eyes watered before I could even catch a snf.A contender for one of the smoothest things I have ever had in my mouth, Macallan gives tinges of citrus sweetness that pirouette around the palate. Irsquom reminded of a rich fruit cake fragrant with winter spices ndash my first thought is how well itrsquod go in a Christmas cake.It tastes richly oaky, yet concurrently fruity I didnrsquot want it to end. The colour is a beautul shade of gold, similar to melted butterscotch. Itrsquos a dessert in itself. Please sir, can I have some more At first glance I thought this was rum. This is the lightest-coloured whisky I have ever drunk, and potentially may ever drink again. The smell was fresh and uplting, like a gust of fresh air atop a munro.To be fair, drinking it made me feel like I was atop a munro. It definitely helped my blocked sinuses. The palate was warming, with what appeared as savoury: salt, pepper and liquorice flavours. I think therersquos a fruit hiding in there somewhere, as a subtle sweetness was clawing through, which beautully contrasted the pepperiness.I could imagine being washed up on a deserted beach, swigging this and having a great time.I thoroughly enjoyed just smelling the fruity and floral tones of this whisky a scent which captures walking through an enchanted orchard full of old oak trees, granny smiths and a plethora of tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples.The taste is lighter than anticipated, given the complex smells. An initial gloopy sweetness is sharply interrupted by darker, woody tastes and hint of charcoal smoke. Irsquom reminded of pine cones crunching beneath my feet, birds chirping and hedgehogs rustling as I walk through a forest towards an enticing cottage, where an open fire, a rocking chair and more whisky awaits me.A fantastical experience.The smoky scent of this whisky is so intriguing ndash it feels like you should be able to see smoke rolling out of the glass, like in those fancy cocktail bars. This comes through in the taste and is joined by tar and almost chocolatey notes, evocative of anafter-dinner chocolate.Then your palate evolves as the smoke settles and nuttiness comes through, accompanied by the taste of raisins and citrus fruits. Itrsquos an ebullient journey of flavour.The paleness in colour is also disorientating the smokiness doesnrsquot quite align instead you feel you should be drinking a dark, piercing black potion.Itrsquos a bit of a rollercoaster of the senses. And like an after dinner chocolate, yoursquoll probably end up having more than one.I mused over the malty, toffee smells for a good while before trying ndash to the point where my eyes were watering ndash simply because they were utterly ambrosial, especially after six other drams.The Naked Grouse is a beautul, deep amber hue, so itrsquos a marvel to look at too.When I finally got to the taste, I was expecting a sweet sugary harmony. What I experienced indeed was a toffee-sweet fudge, mingled with fruity flavours, and a hint of spice which is pulled out at the end to keep you on your toes. Itrsquos a welcome surprise which leaves a memorably fiery aftertaste."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckay-mysteries-myths-water-life","story":"A field of barley, rippling and rustling as the wind stirs through it. It has been a staple of civilisations throughout the world for more than , years.I may be slow on the uptake but,I stood in front of that field, it would never occur to me that, with a little jiggery-pokery, I could turn it into whisky.But someone did. And long before the first record of it in Scotland in the th century, which was simply a cue to tax it. How did it come about There are as many theories as there are brands of malts, from monks bringing the knowledge over from Irelandto the Vikings, who had invaded the Middle East, sacked Constantinople and Mesopotamia, and turned up on Iona in  to attack the monastery, get drunk and somehow, in their cups, spill the secret of how to make the water of le that they had picked up on their foraging jaunts.:Scotch Whisky Associations Karen Betts: Three reasons Scotch is the leblood of communitiesI have my own theory, which is valid as the previous, and it involves a very lazy man called Donald An Deoch, who lived in a black house somewhere on the west coast, possibly Islay, in the fth century, which is handy because no-one could read or write at the time and therefore there are no historical records.Donald couldnrsquot quite get the hang of growing barley and, besides, it involved backbreaking effort, so he relied on the charity of his neighbours, promising them hersquod repay them handsomely one day when his inheritance from a far-off relative arrived.No-one believed him, of course, but still they doled out the barley they could spare so he could make his porridge and survive.The method of making it was to toast the barley and boil it up to make the dish. But Donald had caught several rabbits and hares in his snares so he put the barley in some water, forgot about it, and for almost a week dined on the outdoor catch, which was a lot tastier than his porridge. Now hungry, he remembered the discarded pot, the insides of which were now bubbling away without the aid of direct heat.What to do  He tasted the scum, which was disgusting, but he had to eat and he had no water because the burn had frozen.He had heard tales of how ancient seamen produced fresh water from seawater by boiling, catching the steam in fleeces, and squeezing them out to retrieve the fresh stuff. He had the fleeces he had intended to make into bedding hanging above the fire. So he gave it a go.The result didnrsquot look too good. He had separated the boiled barley from the water, which he had put into another pot, so he decided to repeat the process. And, when the water had cooled he took a deep swig, lights went off in his brain, his throatand stomach burned and he staggered back. For Donald it wasnrsquot just a revelation, it was the water of le or, as he would have called it, uisge beatha.Wherever it came from, there was a lot of it about, hundreds of whisky pot stills had sprung up all over the country before the first reference to it occurred in the Scottish Exchequer Rolls for , which records ldquoeight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aquavitae. Thatrsquos about  kilos today or innumerable sore heads. There is also some evidence that home-distilled whisky formed part of the rent paid by tenants to landowners on Highland farms.Inevitably, the state and big business began to move in. In  the Guild of Surgeon Barbers in Edinburghwere granted a monopoly in the town.And in  the Scottish Parliament passed the Excise Act, taxing whisky at p per Scots pint, about a third of a gallon, or just over . litres .After the Union of the Parliaments in  English revenue staff crossed the border and attempted to impose higher taxes on the hundreds of small distilleries across Scotland. For most of a century it proved a thankless task.:First female Master Whisky Maker Kirsteen Campbell on the myths, the real magic and gender issue in industryOne of the excisemen taken on, after he shamelessly petitioned several nobles, was Rabbie Burns who started work in , four years later being promoted to Excise Officer for Dumfries, at pound a year, or about pound today.Apparently, though, it was a sizeable sum then. Mythology surrounds Burns and one story has him single-handedly, cutlass in hand, or perhaps between his teeth as he braved the waves, capturing the grounded smuggling ship Rosamond. But, whatever his part in it, he was certainly there.The introduction of customs and excise duty following the union of the two countries was regarded as an iniquitous imposition by most Scots, particularly by the hundreds of Highland distillers, and the thousands whose drouths were slaked.Then, as now, the land was barely productive and evenyou were landless you could set yourself up as a distiller and, with a bit of help and ingenuity, not just smuggle whisky to the developing towns but to the large and lucrative English market.The Statistical Account of Scotland of  put it this way: ldquoWhile this infamous and demoralising practice prevailed, population increased through the facilities by which families were maintained in the hills and valleys by its profits.The system of military roads, developed by Wade and Caulfeild, although breaking down, saw nightly processions of pack animals laden with barrels tramping their way to profit.The increasing presence of pesky excisemen led to distillers brewing after the sun went down, so that the steam and smoke from the fires went unnoticed in producing the ldquomoonshine. Corgarff, in what is now Aberdeenshire, was a major centre of distilling as were the glens to the north, such as Glenlivet, now the source of a famous malt from its now legal distillery. Fierce fights between smugglers and excisemen were a nightly occurrence, with the better-armed brigands usually triumphing.The most famous example is the Porteous riots in Edinburgh, which were triggered by the public hanging of a smuggler, Andrew Wilson, in the Grassmarket in .Hundreds gathered and became boisterous, no doubt bolstered by the product Wilson was condemned for, directing their ire at the attendant soldiers, led by the officer in charge, Captain John Porteous, two was pelted with mud. As anger grew Porteous gave the order to fire into the crowd and six people were killed, several more injured. He was tried for murder and, unsurprisingly, unanimously convicted by a jury, although the execution was deferred.Public anger at a possible reprieve mounted and a crowd estimated at  converged on the Tolbooth prison, broke in by overpowering the guards, snatched Porteous from his cell, dragged him to the Grassmarket where they lynched him. Therersquos a memorial plate still, in the ground where it happened. And, despite a massive reward of pound for information on those responsible, no-one was ever convicted.By the s as many as , illicit stills a year were being confiscated by the excisemen, the gaugers, Burnsrsquo successors. And, despite that, more than half the whisky drunk in Scotland had successfully avoided the tax man.It couldnrsquot go on. The Duke of Gordon, who turned a blind eye to some of the finest whisky being produced on his extensive lands, proposed that the government should properly cash in on production.In  the Excise Act was passed, which outlawed production of less than  gallons , legal distilling was sanctioned for an annual licence of pound and a tax, at todayrsquos equivalent of p a gallon. A year later George Smith was the first outlaw distiller to go legal, taking out a licence for Glenlivet, although his neighbours threatened to burn the place down down.The advent of grain, blended whisky and a crop of Scottish entrepreneurs like James Buchanan, Tommy Dewar, Johnnie Walker and James Chivas took Scotch beyond Britain, beyond the British Empire to America, Australia and the most remote spots on the planet.Scotch boomed in the US. Prohibition in , however, put a dampener on trade and several Scottish distilleries were mothballed. It was, though, still possible to beat the ban as long as whisky was prescribed for medicinal purposes.One person to squeeze through the loophole was Winston Churchill. In December  he was on a -stop lecture tour when he looked the wrong way crossing Fth Avenue in New York and was knocked down by a car and hospitalised.His US physician provided the sick note, writing that his condition ldquonecessitates the use of alcoholic spirits especially at meal times. The quantity is naturally indefinite ... Naturally!And so it goes. Today the Scotch Whisky Association claims that pound out of every pound spent on whisky goes to the Treasury, contributing some pound billion to the economy, with poundbn earned in exports, and more than , jobs dependent on us repetitively sinking the wee goldies.To distil alcohol today you need a licence from HMRC. You also need to provide a business plan and prove that yoursquore a fitand proper person, aka rich, as well as a fulfilling a dizzying number of regulations and requirements, which rules it out for all but large companies with oodles of cash and savvy lawyers.:Whisky taste test: how a beginner became an expert in seven dramsAndyou want to make it for your own use  Well you canrsquot, because the taxman wonrsquot give you a licence. It makes youwonder just why itrsquos so easy to buy the wherewithal on Amazon and other places, some for less than pound, like the -litre, stainless steel Moonshine Still  It couldnrsquot be that the maximum fine is pound and the chances of being prosecuted are of the lightning strike possibility But, despite the conflicts over its chequered history, or probably because of it, we have developed the greatest, most distinctive, ied and unequalled range of the finest spirit ever produced. And we owe it all to Donald An Deoch."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-show-review","story":"There was Andrew Marr, who was interviewing Boris Johnson on The Andrew Marr Show.

Auntie has lots of sons called Andrew. She may even have daughters, too. Why, at this very minute, Emily Maitlis or Emma Barnett could be changing their names to Andrew to secure that coveted one to one with the PM.: Iain Macwhirter on Johnsons poll leadIt may seem odd for the media to be gazing at its own navel in this way, but as anyone who lived through The War of Jennerrsquos Ear and Bigotgate will attest, it is not an election proper until journalists have joined in the fighting.

Not to be outdone, the BBC managed to get itself embroiled in argy bargy over its Andrews.At first, it seemed Auntie had sorted matters.

It was a bold position which duly crumbled on Saturday afternoon when the BBC said that following Fridayrsquos terrorist attack at London Bridge it was now ldquoin the public interest for the PM to be on Marr. Cue outrage from Labour and others, accusing the corporation of caving in.Come am Sunday, all eyes that were open and focussed were trained on Marrrsquos show.

Oh, but they did, forcing the viewer to sit through interviews with Labourrsquos Shami Chakrabarti and the Lib Demsrsquo Chuka Umunna.

There was a lot at stake. Not the security of the nation or the countryrsquos economic prospects. This was far more serious than any of that. This was about ego. Mr Johnson had to show that he was not scared of blokes called Andrew, and a bloke called Andrew wanted to show him that he jolly well should be scared of blokes called Andrew.: Johnson accused over recordConsider,you will, how Marr might have felt as the row over the Neil show raged. Both big beasts in the jungle of political journalism yet there he was, by implication the softer option in comparison with his fellow countryman. If that was not the case, why would Downing Street say yes to his request but ldquowersquoll let you know to Neilrsquos  This was as much about Marr v Neil as it was Marr against Johnson.It turned out to be a marvellously tetchy encounter, handbags and harrumphs at dawn stuff, or as near to dawn as we could get without knocking the Match of the Day repeat out of the schedule.Marr began on the London Bridge attack, asking how a dangerous criminal could be released after  years in jail. Labourrsquos fault, claimed Mr Johnson, they brought in a law on automatic early release in . But you have been in power for ten years, Marr replied, you could have changed things. Irsquove been in office  days, said Mr Johnson.So it went on. The two were like characters in a cartoon fight. As verbal fists and feet flew, dust clouds enveloped the pair. Every now and then a speech balloon would pop up. ldquoTen years, kapow! ldquo days, crunch! Thump, thump, thump.Marr changed tack. ldquoYoursquore trying to avoid my questions by carrying on talking, he charged. This was a notable iation on the Mishal Husain line, in which the Today presenter, suffering a similar barrage of bluster from Johnson, told him to ldquoplease stop talking. It did not do her any good, and the same held true for Marr as he proceeded to go down a shopping list of topics from the NHS to library closures, getting nowhere. ldquoYou are chuntering! he told Mr Johnson. ldquoYou keep interrupting me! the PM snapped.The minutes were sprinting away like Bullingdon boys after a spot of bother at a local restaurant. Would Marr ask the big question, the one the media was interested in most of all. To wit: would the PM go on Neilrsquos show  Johnson dodged, weaved, and schmoozed, saying Neil could not have a better agent than Marr , before making his ldquoIrsquoll talk to any BBC Andrew declaration.: Nato Secretary General responds over TridentMarr, running over time, brought the interview to an abrupt end. The cameras focussed on the two men while the credits rolled. Usually in these situations there is a bit of chat, evenit is only the host asking what the guest fancies for breakfast. No such bonhomie here. Marr shuffled his papers. Mr Johnson, job done according to his reckoning, watched him. You could have cut the atmosphere with an industrial chainsaw.

But residents can help save tax-payers’ money by making better use of available recycling services and avoiding sending items to landfill unnecessarily, as sending waste to landfill costs much more than recycling.Waste team manager Andrew Sheridan explains: “In terms of food waste, first and foremost we are encouraging residents to reuse their leftover turkey and vegetables in warming casseroles, tasty pies or even bespoke pizzas.“Failing that then you can recycle foodstuffs in your food caddies which are collected from homes every week.”And when it comes to the array of Christmas-related materials we accumulate, there are many types of cardboard, non-glittery Christmas cards and other items which can all be popped into your blue-lidded kerbside bins which are picked up fortnightly.Andrew explains: “Wrapping paper can only be recycledit passes the scrunch test - simple paper wrap can be recycled, but foil or glitter-decorated paper cannot and needs to go in the general waste. It’s astonishing just how much of this material can actually be turned into new products,instead of rotting away for years in landfill.“To help ensure householders make the most of their Christmas materials, a host of fun festive recycling tips will be published on the council’s social media channels, including ideas for presents that won’t cost the earth.”When it comes to real Christmas trees and larger items of cardboard packaging, these can be taken to Aberdeenshire’s recycling centres.

Active Schools Lead Coordinator for Central Aberdeenshire, Malcolm Grant, said: “Across Scotland this month the sporting theme from sportscotland is Local Heroes and Eilish ticked every box during her visits to Oyne Primary and Inverurie Academy. “The focus on personal best resonates strongly across a broad range of school subjects, not just sport, but having Eilish presenting her thoughts on her own career and how she intends to continue to improve and progress, despite her already extensive achievements in athletics, ensured that all of the pupils went home with some extra inspiration and motivation to do the best that they can, whatever they choose to do in the future.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Neil McDonald, Scott Duguid and Peter Taylor at the eBlast celebration event\"  Kintore firm marks th anniversaryviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Lady Michelle Mone OBE attended the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club Business Lunch\"  Inverurie club marks decade of success viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with Lidl, to offer readers the chance to win £ worth of vouchers to use in Lidl stores.

With growing awareness of the huge threats facing wildle and habitats in the UK and across the world, it would be great to have more festival events which focus on the importance of looking after our environment and give people the opportunity to get involved on a local level to help save nature.#I would like to encourage anyone who has an idea for an event they would like to run to get in touch as soon as possible.”Any organisation or inidual who would like to take part in the  festival can contact Eleanor at the RSPB Orkney office in Stromness on  or email orkney@rspb.org.uk  For more information on the festival as it becomes available you can check out the website at: www.orkneynaturefestival.orgOr visit the festival#s Facebook page at: www.facebook OrkneyNatureFestivalcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly.

The former Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, who stepped down in February, also never minced her words in  years of regulating buses and lorries.Recalling her time in the hot seat at an event in Edinburgh this week, she said she had turned the “turgid”, paperwork-focused approach of the office into “dynamic engagement” with bus operators and haulage companies, driven by her overarching goal of keeping people safe on the roads.From the cases I have covered over the years, Ms Aitken had no compunction in banning miscreant operators or putting them out of business, and she let them know why in no uncertain terms.She told a Glasgow lorry driver she would not wait until he killed someone, and he could not be trusted behind the wheel because his greed for making more money came before safety.The owner of a South Lanarkshire childcare centre was told that Ms Aitken was “singularly unimpressed by her seeing herself as some sort of victim” - when she had failed to get a licence.Speaking to the Scottish Transport Studies Group think tank, Ms Aitken’s job sounded at times like being a sherf in the Wild West, imposing the law on bus wars, “baddies” and the “criminality” of some operators.However, while Ms Aitken said she had largely stamped out such behaviour, and buses were now much more reliable, punctual and safer, she admitted there was still one key area in which she wished she had done more.The former traffic commissioner said she had noticed sexism soon after taking over, and wondereddodgy operators told her wheels came off buses for no reason “because I was a girl”.She observed there had been some improvements, such as the “nonsense of naked lady photos” on depot walls being removed.But Ms Aitken said there remained “real issues” over increasing the number of women working in transport.A report by the cycling and walking body Sustrans Scotland last year highlighted that transport had the lowest percentage of women in senior posts within the public sector north of the Border - of just . per cent.In addition, despite comprising nearly half the UK workforce, women account for only around one in five transport workers.Ms Aitken observed that while there were some very successful female bus drivers and hauliers, working conditions remained a major deterrent to more women working in the sector.She said part of the problem was the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets, and suitable sht patterns.The Women in Transport group has stressed the importance of a more gender-balanced workforce to help better address women’s needs as passengers - since the majority on buses are female. With so few women at the helm of Scottish transport firms, it’s encouraging to see at least some new additions.As well as lawyer and engineer Claire Gilmore replacing Ms Aitken as traffic commissioner, Caroline Donaldson was this week appointed as managing director of the West Coast Partnership Development, which will help devise plans for HS, whose trains are due to run on to Edinburgh and Glasgow.She joins industry leaders such as bus firm Xplore Dundee managing director Christine McGlasson, and Scottish Canals chief executive Catherine Topley - but there should be many, many more.

It led me to consider just how quickly time passes, and indeed how it appears to pass more quickly as one travels through the years.It also took me down memory lane of the  and  general electionsI mention all of this because I urge readers to not believe anything is as presented in a general election by the leading political parties – or the media, who often have an agenda to push or have bought into some utterly ridiculous spin on why things seem as they do. Thankfully The Scotsman has eschewed taking an editorial line on which party to support in preference to seeking out the truth. No, what appears political reality is often a mirage, a poor reflection of what is actually happening a  paradigm that a Timelord might discover bears no relation to what is in the history books.This is where we are in this general election. We have esteemed experts, partisan politicians and bookmakers on the make all trying to tell us what is likely to happen – and the truth is they really do not know. How many of them would take a £ punt on what they tell us is the likely outcome  They can look at national polling, even regional polling they can play around with Electoral calculus which changes the colour of constituency maps as often as a Chameleon and they can attend focus groups to consider what biscuit each leader might be in the minds of the electorate.Yet they still cannot say what will happen.The reality I work under is that while there are national moods and regional swings there are also localised iations, and when with less than three weeks still to go a general election is as close as this one could be, it is in a small number of seats where the outcome will be decided.Last week I met an old friend, the former MEP Tim Aker who was a UKIP general election candidate in his local constituency of Thurrock in  and . Tim swears that it is only because of the strong campaigning by UKIP in Thurrock that the Conservatives defeated Labour on both those occasions. The reasoning is simple but compelling, the electoral ision of Thurrock is strongly eurosceptic and all the more so in Labour wards. Tim polled especially well in Labour heartlands such as Tilbury, so well that Labour lost enough votes in a three-way fight with the Tories for the Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price to hold the seat with a narrow majority.It is what we might call the Thurrock Effect, for it is not limited to Tim Aker’s personal intervention but is repeated in a crucial minority of constituencies across the land. The Thurrock Factor is where the intervention of a third-placed challenger such as UKIP, or in today’s case the Brexit Party, takes so many votes from the Labour candidate that the Conservatives win when the expectation is they will lose. As I wrote last week, Boris Johnson should win, but it is his to lose and Theresa May has shown how easily the Tories can fumble the ball. Thus In a time when the outcome is anything but clear constituencies, where the Thurrock effect might transpire could be the dference between a Johnson and Corbyn government. Seats such as Greater Grimsby are suddenly looking like good prospects for the Conservatives. In this Labour seat polling tells us that the Tory support has remained steady while Labour’s has declined by % with the intervention of the Brexit Party taking some % of the vote. This is a classic example of the Thurrock Effect.Other seats could experience the same phenomenon – or at least come close to scaring the bejeesus out of sitting Labour MPs. Everyone in Bishop Auckland, even Labour voters, tell me the incumbent Helen Goodman is unpopular. The Brexit Party has a good candidate in Nick Brown who should do well and could provide an upset, buthe doesn’t then the Tory Dehenna Davison could benefit from his campaigning winning over Labour voters, leaving her to seize the day. Other English seats such as Keighley, Rother Valley, Dewsbury and Wakefield fit this format. The common factor is these are all northern seats, where the Brexit Party could win a handful of Labour fiefdoms – or make it possible for the Tories to benefit from their hard work. So much for the Brexit Party splitting the leave vote and letting Jeremy Corbyn in – but don’t expect Boris Johnson to thank Nigel Farage for standing candidates in such marginals. Only a fortnight ago Johnson’s lieutenants were demanding Farage stand more of his candidates down.In Scotland the existence of the independence question changes everything. With the SNP decimating Labour in  and Corbyn’s party only coming third after the Tories in  the debate about Brexit has less resonance than in England and Wales – but it still matters.With Brexit Party candidates withdrawing from all Tory held seats the latest polling suggests the Conservatives are doing well in Scotland while Labour could lose all but Edinburgh South. I will go further and suggest there will be a perverse McThurrock Effect – where Labour voters who cannot stomach Corbyn hold their noses and vote Conservative as the most attractive unionist party, ironically helping the SNP to retain those marginal seats.This would be important, for seven of Labour’s top twenty target constituencies in the UK are held by the SNP. You don’t need to be a time traveller to work out Corbyn winning the general election will only exist in some parallel universe.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":null,"title":"loneliness is truly the worst thing i have ever had to face","story":"Mary* was supported by Age NI to help her cope with the loneliness and grief she was experiencing after the death of her sister.Age NI helps people suffering from lonelinessShersquos sharing her story as part of Age NIrsquos No one should have no one turn to campaign, to raise awareness of the impact that loneliness can have.She hopes that by speaking out, people will be inspired to donate to Age NI this winter, to enable them to continue to support more people like her.She said: Irsquom .

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

Fermanagh warden Joe Magee launch the conservation charitys new boat on Lower Lough Erne. The cot named the Joe Magee will be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlew. Funding for the cot came from the European Unions INTERREG VA Programme through the RSPB NI-led Co-operation Across Borders for Bioersityproject.Pictures: Ronan McGradeBrad Robson, RSPB NI area manager, who succeeded Joe in Fermanagh in , said: “The cot is used throughout the year. We move about  cattle and  sheep back and forth to our managed islands, as well as livestock to other privately-owned islands. In its first voyages, the new vessel will be used to bring livestock off for the winter.“We were delighted to be able to name it after Joe and it’s vital that we continue our work to provide ideal habitats for the curlews and other waders and wildle species in Lower Lough Erne. We are grateful to the European Union’s INTERREG VA Programme for funding this cot as part of CABB. A further aspect of the CABB project is to raise awareness in the community of the environmental, cultural and historical importance of these wetland habitats.”Joe added: “We originally used a wooden cot, which a farmer let us use. Then we built our own, although at first it had no engine on it and we had to tow it using another boat. So eventually we got an engine and that made le easier!“I knew that across the island of Ireland curlew numbers were dropping, so it’s important that work is still being done to look after them.”Thecot named the Joe Mageewill be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlewUnderlining the importance of this part of the project, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the SEUPB, said: “The curlew is one of a number of endangered priority species identied in the environmental protection measures within the EU INTERREG Programme. This new cot is a fantastic example of the tangible impact that EU INTERREG funding is having in safeguarding the natural environment and protecting endangered species, on a cross-border basis. Due to this intervention by the CABB project, curlews will have a much better future. I also want to commend Joe for his commitment to conservation.”The -metre custom-made cot weighs  tonnes and was built by Wales-based marine engineers and workboat builders Mainstay Marine Solutions.These are the worst areas in the UK for drink and drug driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\" project\" title\"RSPB NIs Brad Robson and former RSPB Fermanagh warden Joe Magee launch the conservation charitys new boat on Lower Lough Erne.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends. Most of them have passed on unfortunately but we do have the present days menrsquos club. We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users. And of course you have a meal here every day and a bit of chat.ldquoIrsquom here every day. Irsquom a service user two days a week a volunteer the other three days. Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours. Itrsquos important for older people to look out for each other.Mabels storyMabel McCracken, who has been coming to Age NI for the past three years, agreed with Robert.ldquoEvery time yoursquore out you should say lsquohellorsquo ndash itrsquos important to be friendly, said the -year-old.Mabel told her story of how she came to be living on her own: ldquoI was a shorthand typist. I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert . All the time they give is appreciated.Recently Age NI teamed up with Blythswood Care to put together a relief package containing  blankets and  shoeboxes to be sent to Serbia.The group has had its share of celebrity mums with both Van Morrison and Dan Gordonrsquos mother attending.Proof that you donrsquot have to be alone to suffer from lonelinessLucy Quinn is proof that it is still possible to be lonely even when you come from a very large family.The east Belfast woman has eight children,  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.She said: ldquoI see my family very regularly but therersquos some days Irsquom just sitting in the house on my own. I bought myself a recliner chair and Irsquove got aframe to help me when I need to get up.ldquoIrsquod read magazines and do crosswords books to put the time in. I buy them to keep my brain active. Irsquod watch some TV as well.She said: ldquoI originally came from down by the shipyards. My father worked there and my brothers-in-law.ldquoMy husband died  years ago. He died aged  and one of my sons also died aged .ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking when you lose people who are very close to you.She commented: ldquoIt seems strange to say I get lonely when Irsquove got such a big family but loneliness isnrsquot straightforward.Lucy, who lives with her youngest daughter Karen, said: ldquoOne night Irsquoll have sevenin, sometimes there can be  or  of them in. You never know until they press the buzzer who will be coming.ldquoI have  grandchildren and great grandchildren. I think itrsquos  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.ldquoI give them all money for birthdays and Christmas. Therersquos too many to keep track of all their interests.ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquod spend most of my money. I save up. I donrsquot smoke and I donrsquot drink and I hardly ever go out.Lucy has been coming to Age NI for  years next May: ldquoThey used to be up in the North Road, I started off there.ldquoA girl called Valerie who used to the run the club, she said to myself and a couple of neighbours to come along. That was the start of it.ldquoIrsquom disabled, but not as much then as I am now.ldquoI love coming here. I come one day a week. When my daughters are all working it gives me something to look forward to.ldquoI love everything here, it would be the only exercise I get. ldquoThe cook is brilliant, Jean has been here since day one. ldquoThe craic is brilliant, I might be disabled but I can still carry on a joke.Older people in numbers in  older people are lonely in NIK older people in NI say that TV is their main form of companyAge NI has a total of  day centres across Northern Ireland.million people in the UK can go five or six days without seeing or speaking to anyoneThere are , people over the age of  living in Northern IrelandHow to help lonely peopleAge NI are at the forefront of change, enabling older people to have a voice and to remain independent, supporting those who need help in society and inspiring people to love later le. They help thousands of older people every year, providing advice, care and support when itrsquos needed most.If you suspect someone you know may be lonely, you can help by:Being there - Simply being there for the person can let them know that someone cares.

Having someone who is willing to listen could be a great comfort.Encourage and support them to get help - Reassure them that itrsquos possible to feel better with the right help.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

I always pushed mum and dad to put more decorations up but they never gave in.“I probably started to enjoy it more when I had my own place and could decorate as much as I like.“When I moved out, I remember buying a lot of stuff for the first Christmas in my new place“I ended up buying more and more. It was like an addiction.“From the start of October, I get itchy feet to get the decorations up. I love the lead-up to Christmas, especially having friends round who compliment my display every year.“I wanted to be more organised this year because I am going to New York before Christmas. I can’t wait – it is the main place to see at Christmas and no doubt I will do more shopping for things I can use next year in the house.”Paul, who works in household store Nobletts in North Street also helps design their annual window display.“I’ve just finished getting the window display done for Nobletts. People have been asking me to do theirs too, so there may be a business idea there for me in the future.“It is something I look forward to doing every year at Nobletts. I specialise in interior design so I know quite a bit about colours and display.“The store even won a competition for the Best Window Display in Europe a few years ago so I was very proud of that.”Askedhe had a message for any bah, humbugs out there, Paul said, “Stay inside and don’t bring any negative energy near me.“At the end of the day, I can’t make people embrace Christmasthey don’t want to.”Mum, Sylvia says despite loving her son’s effort and display, she could never put her own house Christmas decorations and tree up this early.“It gets me in the mood for Christmas too but I could never have my tree and decorations up this early.“I love coming down to his house, especially at night time when it is all lit up and looks fantastic.

I remain focused on delivering for North Belfast.“It has generally been a positive campaign so far. The dynamic that this election transcends party politics is being received on the doors. That positive message about maximizing the Remain vote is being received very well.“We are running a very positive campaign by looking to the future by delivering better for North Belfast. It is an area as the readers will know that has been left behind and has many challenges. I want to be an MP to get stuck into those challenges.”Mr Finucane and his party have also faced criticism from opponents regarding Sean Kelly, the man convicted of the  Shankill bomb, who has worked as a party canvasser in North Belfast. However, John Finucane pointed to remarks by leading victims’ campaigner Alan McBride, who lost his we in the Shankill bomb, urging all political parties to be mindful of victims at election time.“Alan McBride is one of the most impressive people that I have met. He is considerate and well-measured,” said John.“His response to this debate is something everyone needs to listen to. I have and the party has, of being mindful and respectful of victims at election time. He has also called out the banners which are hurtful to those families who lost loved ones in the Shankill which I agree with.“He also called out the DUP hypocrisy on this issue – a party which has convicted drug dealers canvassing for them, engages with active loyalist paramilitaries connected with offences up to and including murder this year. Alan has been a strong and reasonable voice in this debate and I welcome his comments.”In an election that many see isabout Brexit, Sinn Fein’s long-standing abstentionism policy at Westminster has once again surfaced but Mr Finucane is adamant protection for the people of Ireland does not come from the green benches of the House of Commons. “It is an issue which has come up on the doors. Since the last Westminster election and the dynamic between the DUP and the Tories, there is absolutely no appetite by the British government to compensate or consider the impact of Brexit on the people of Ireland. It is not on their radar at all.“The DUP got spectacularly thrown under the bus and showed that no matter what your constitutional aspirations are, the British government simply does not careyou live in this part of the world.“Those who want to protect their European identity or voted to Remain – the protection is never coming from the green benches of Westminster. The protection comes from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the EU  and in America, supported by Sinn Féin.”John Finucane will contest a close-fought election contest with the DUP’s outgoing MP Nigel Dodds, someone many see as the chief architect of a hard Brexit.“Hewould be proud of that title. He was part of the Vote Leave campaign. He has been the DUP head at Westminster and is proud of his Brexit record.“The two defining political moments in my letime have been the Good Friday Agreement and Brexit and Nigel Dodds is on the wrong side of history in both of those. He continues to be opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and he continues to champion Brexit which goes against the majority of people’s views in North Belfast which is hopefully reflected on December .”Looking at local issues affecting North Belfast, the Sinn Féin candidate wants to address food banks, the mental health crisis, housing and anti-social behaviour, amongst others.“In North Belfast, we have food banks, a mental health crisis, reliance on prescription drugs, very toxic legacy from the conflict, suicide crisis particularly amongst our young people.“I don’t want to refight old battles or use the past to poke my neighbour in the eye. People want to move forward with political leadership that can do just that.”He said the DUP’s record on housing “is despicable”.“They object to housing for reasons that can be interpreted as nothing short of sectarian,” he said. “This is the brand of politics I think North Belfast wants to turn its back on. Housing is a right that is founded and based on need and nothing to do with religion, who you vote for or ethnicity.“North Belfast has a housing crisis – we are top of all the tables you don’t want to be top of and bottom of all the tables you don’t want to be bottom of.There are areas of land that need to be used for housing. There needs to be a major overhaul. We are up against a lot of opposition which the DUP are at the heart of.“Mental health, bonfires and anti-social behaviour are all linked in many ways. It is no surprise that those involved in anti-social behaviour come from economically-deprived and challenging backgrounds.“I was in the New Lodge this week and saw for myself the good work that is being done to remove people from engaging in anti-social behaviour. The community doesn’t want it. I think it was unfortunate this year to see the response of the police that eroded a lot of confidence from the local community.“Hard work needs to continue all year around. Statutory bodies, police and council all have a responsibility too. There is a lot of positive work happening – one example is the Féile dance night which takes young people away from bonfires.“From my day job as a solicitor, I know there are complicated reasons why people find themselves in the criminal justice system. The work has started and continues to operate all year around.”Asked about a border poll, John was quick to urge caution.“I don’t think we are ready for it tomorrow. The inevitability of a border poll is accepted and I say that, having listened to unionists. The mechanism is there in the Good Friday Agreement and we are close to the point when it will be called.“Brexit has shown you need to be prepared for a referendum and people need to be clear what they are voting for and what they are voting against.” also saw John Finucane installed as Lord Mayor, becoming the First Citizen of Belfast after he was elected to Belfast City Council in May and he says he has been encouraged by the fantastic work he has witnessed right across the city.“I was given advice from Tom Hartley who said you only think you know your city and he was absolutely right.“I am from the best part of the city – North Belfast – but really I only knew it geographically. I have seen the fantastic work that goes on in communities across the city that I wasn’t aware of. None of it gets much attention but I am very encouraged by the vision for this city, which is happening North, South, East and West.”As a former county footballer and the current goalkeeper for Lámh Dhearg, John suffered heartbreaking defeat in the Antrim Senior Football Final against Cargin last month.“I have tried to make sure this defeat isn’t talked about again,” he says. “It was a tough one to take but a season that won’t be forgotten in a hurry.“We had some really good wins over Creggan and Portglenone but just came up short in the second final against Cargin after extra-time.”The Sinn Féin man is determined not to come up short again when the votes are counted on December ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"planning process rumbles on as casement project marks","story":"THE Chairman of Casement Park Stadium Development Project board has expressed “deep frustration” that the project continues to be stalled , days after its second planning application was submitted.Funding for the ambitious stadium project was announced in March  as part of major upgrades to Windsor Park and then Ravenhill Stadium. Planning approval for Casement was quashed in December . The two other stadium projects have been completed.Revised plans were submitted in February  with a reduced spectator capacity of ,. The plans are still being assessed by planning officials.In a letter sent on behalf of Ulster GAA, Tom Daly said the plans “continue to be encumbered by a prolonged planning process”.“Mondaymarks , days since Ulster GAA submitted its planning application in February  for an iconic new Provincial Stadium in Belfast which would deliver the last strand of the Regional Stadia Development Programme, a key commitment within the NI Executive Programme for Government.“The completion of Kingspan Ravenhill Stadium for Ulster Rugby and the Irish Football Association’s Windsor Park Stadium is bringing signicant benefits to their members and to wider society and it is obvious that the provisions of modern infrastructure has helped develop the profile and standing of both sports.“At Ulster GAA we are determined that , association members and new visitors to our games will enjoy similar benefits once the long-standing commitment made to us by Government are fulfilled.”Cost of the new stadium now stands at £ million,  per cent more than the initial £. million budgeted.The Department for Infrastructuresaid it recognizes the importance of the planning application for Casement Park.“We appreciate that there is frustration at the time taken to process it, however this is a complex proposal where dferent views and concerns are apparent. It is essential that the planning process is progressed in a thorough, fair and objective manner that ensures that all relevant factors are considered.#The Department has pursued comments from all consultees in order to complete its professional assessment of the application and these have now all been received. We have met with the applicant#s team with a further meeting planned, to see how a small number of outstanding issues related to Roads matters can be progressed.#We are working hard to progress the planning application to the point where it is ready for a decision to be made. The next stages will depend on the political and legislative context that applies at that point.#West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told Daily Belfast that he shares the “same frustration” that the GAA have expressed.“I’ve met with the GAA Casement development team on many occasions and they have submitted all relevant information to planners over the last three years.“In my view the planners have had enough time to review this case in all its detail and they should make the decision soon.“I’ve met with the planners regularly and I continue to push them to make the decision. I have pointed out to them that other major planning applications have been submitted to the planners after Casement Park application and they’ve been approved. I know they have to make sure they get it right as there was a legal ruling on it but , days is long enough,” he said.“Casement, when built, will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast. We’ve seen major development in recent years including the new Andersonstown leisure centre almost next door and that will be completed early next year.“The vast majority of people want to see it built, they know the benefits that it will bring. Hopefully a decision will be taken by the planners in the very near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the principal christos gaitatzis of omagh high school on the importance of nonselective and integrated education","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most of the real Greek feta cheese that you will eat is produced around my home town. My grandfather was a dairy farmer but with goats and ewes, not cattle.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High SchoolMy dad was in the merchant navy but when he met my mum he started up a small garage and I have two brothers, one of whom is in the Greek army.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetI did well at school but when it came to A-levels I was not sure what I wanted to do.I considered medicine or entering the military academy.I always loved a challenge and then the idea of going to university in England came to me.There were no tuition fees to pay then and the European Union had opened the doors for students to travel abroad.Q: What did you study in England A: I went to Sunderland university and studied pharmacology and I did well, gaining a : degree. Being in England was the challenge I was looking for. I obviously met a lot of new people and experienced new cultures. It was the first time I had met anyone from Ireland, India, Pakistan or even France.Q: What was your next move A: Initially I had planned to go into biochemistry but then the idea of teaching took hold. It was something that would keep me occupied.I liked the idea of coping with people of dferent backgrounds, being involved with dferent topics and dealing with a large number of people on a daily basis. That to me is the biggest challenge in le and where could I get that challenge - in teaching.Q: How did your teaching career develop A: I was a big fan of football in the s and I began to follow Blackburn Rovers and that led me to do my teacher training in the north west of England where the team was based. I simply chose where I would go based on the success of a football team as I did not have any connections anywhere in the UK.I did my teacher training in Preston and began work as a physics teacher. My first school was a small Catholic school - very similar in size to Omagh High - in Leyland in Lancashire. Then about four years later I moved to a Church of England grammar school for boys in Blackpool and then later became vice-principal of another Blackpool school. It was an area where there were high levels of deprivation.Some years later I followed the principal of that school to an independent fee paying boarding school in a very affluent area and became a senior teacher there. That was my last job before coming to Omagh.Q: Had you been to Northern Ireland before A: Martina and I used to come here regularly to visit her family and we would spend time on holiday here. Other years we would holiday in Greece. When the job of principal at Omagh High came up last summer I decided to apply for it. We knew we wanted to bring up Eliza near family and spend more time together. That was more important than being away from home no matter how many other opportunities there were.Q: What are your impressions of your new school A: I came from one extreme to the other. The independent school was in a very affluent area and that was reflected in the school. In Omagh there are concerns over the condition of the buildings and maintenance issues. But it is no dferent from what many other schools here are experiencing.Omagh High SchoolQ: What  do you know about the school A: It was the first controlled non-selective school in Northern Ireland to get an outstanding award during inspection in  which was a great accolade and that level has been sustained up to the last inspection in May this year.Q: What are the challenges you face as principal A: While the school has set very high standards it has multiple challenges. The fabric of the building is past its sell-by date. It needs signicant investment to keep it looking good but we are trying to sustain a good level of presentation of the building.We are waiting to get into a new school on a new campus with five other schools in the town. Hopefully that will happen within the next decade.Q: What is the ethos of Omagh High A: It is a co-educational non-selective school with a very open perspective. Everyone is welcome in the school and there are a signicant number of pupils from a Protestant background and a good number of Catholic pupils.I find the pupils are not so keen to talk about religion as much as parents might be. I feel it is a totally integrated school.We also have a number of children, -, who come from Europe and dont speak English. We spend a lot of time with them to help them.Q: What are your hopes for the pupils of Omagh High A: I believe that -% of the pupils are of very high ability and could go on the universitythey wished. We have a whole spectrum of abilities and that is very important to us.That is what we want to promote and we want to offer every pupil a quality education and care. Outstanding care and education is a part of what we do every day. I am happy to tell parents that their children do not need to go to a selective school to get a good education or to become well rounded iniduals.Q: So examination results are not everything A: No. Pupils should get extra value added to their lives by the time they leave school. We want every student to rise and rise as they go along the educational process and this is achievable in a non selective school by taking heed of the abilities of each student.Q: What do you think of integrated education A: I am a big believer in non-selective and integrated education. That is immense for this province in order for us to become better. I genuinely believe mixing kids of dferent backgrounds is very good in a societal context. The staff of a school define the space and the standards andyou have staff of high quality - like we do - that sets the tone.Q: How has the squeeze in public funding affected schools A: There are several effects. Staff salaries have increased by -% over the past  years but there has been no real increase in funding per pupil. Increases in pension contributions and National Insurance contributions have had to be absorbed by schools.This has made things very dficult for a number of schools and there are now more schools in budgetary deficit than are in surplus. The cost of things like books and energy have gone up three, four or % which is another challenge when income has not risen.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High SchoolFor us in Omagh, schools were supposed to be on a new campus by now. That means that maintenance issues have become worse and are going to be very expensive to fix and that will have a high impact on my budget. We are trying to squeeze water out of a stone. Very recently I discovered that the space beneath our assembly hall resembled a swimming pool. Some central heating pipes had broken and flooded the area. So our maintenance people had to work all weekend to pump out the water and fix the leak. I had  kids doing mock exams and they had to be switched to the sports hall.Q: Does the lack of devolved government make the problems worse A: The lack of politicians and the lack of decision makers play a role. No matter how good the Permanent Secretary of the Department is or how hard he works some decisions have to be taken by elected representatives.The politicians need to get together and start taking decisions for the good of the people, not for their own good. They have to stop thinking about their personal careers and start representing the people and start talking to each other. Yes there is a crisis.Q: What  impacts on the schools A: Industrial action has taken place over the past number of years and that has resulted in us not being able to intervene on certain things. We work on the goodwill of staff because of that industrial action.Q: You present a very challenging future A: There are multiple problems and they can cause a chain reaction. But we are optimistic because we are in this job to make kids good leaders and good learners so they can make this world a better place than it is.There has to be a clear indication of where we are heading and when. We are using our own human resources to get through the storms - we are walking barefoot in the snow.Q: How are you settling into Omagh as an inidual A: Northern Ireland is one of the friendliest and warmest places I have ever been, although I am not talking about the weather, but rather the hearts of the people.I am of the Greek Orthodox faith and in Preston we had a very small community but it grew and eventually we got our own church.That is one of the things I am missing in terms of my spiritual work and guidance - not having my own church and priest.I have to say my prayers alone or go to the churches of my we or my friends. I can go to any denomination.Q: Are you still a big football fan A: I am a qualied basketball coach and I have always loved the sport. I played for the north Greece team at under- level and still support Aris Thessaloniki. There is a basketball team in Omagh and maybe I can get involved with it because I love the sport.Q: Tell me something unusual about yourself A: My surname means bagpiper and my grandfather was a bagpiper. I cannot play but my younger brother who is in the Army plays it. School factfileName of school: Omagh High SchoolFounded: Number of pupils: Number of teachers: Notable for recent successes: First controlled school in Northern Ireland to be awarded outstanding status .This accolade consistently confirmed in follow up inspections .

Fine Gaels tight margin for passing laws with the support of a coalition of independents will shrink further following the results of Fridays vote in parts of Dublin and the south. Contests were ordered to fill vacancies left by parliamentarians elected to the European Parliament in May. Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said: \"The vote was a clear rejection of the current governments housing and health policies and a vote for Sinn Feins proposals for the biggest public housing programme in decades, investment in public services and for planning for Irish unity. \"The result is signicant for a number of reasons - it exposed a totally out of touch government which is failing to deliver for workers and families and a growing impatience among the people at a government wasting the economic growth of recent years.\" Fine Gael leader and Irish premier Leo Varadkar faces a general election for the Dail parliament next spring while grappling with the ongoing impact of Brexit on his countrys economy. He governs with the support of a number of independent members in the Dail. While the economy is relatively buoyant, Mr Varadkar is facing fierce criticism from rivals Fianna Fail and left-wing opponents over issues like homelessness. A vote of no confidence in his housing minister tabled by his political opponents is due to be held next week."},{"url":null,"title":"ivan little hold on a wee second this is something many fellas have done after a night out","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chief rabbis view of corbyn backed by northern ireland jewish leader","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In certain circles that is a bad word. I get the feeling the majority of what they call the left-wing middle-class circle that Corbyn would belong to, dont believe the state of Israel should exist.

I dont think hehas much support. I dont know too many people who would support a Labour Government under Corbyn. In fact, I dont know anybody.\"Mr Black reflected on how he and his community have been subject to anti-Semitism here in Northern Ireland in the past, and how in most cases it is related to ignorance about the Jewish faith.\"Ive had abuse online because of my background. We have also seen issues in Belfast. There are a small number of people who wouldnt see my point of view,\" he added.\"There is a lot of ignorance as well. People say things not necessarily meaning anything, but just through ignorance. I meet people who have never actually met a Jew before. It is not part of their le. They wouldnt understand and know the things I would be involved in.\"It would just be another world to them.\"Askedhe had any personal advice for Mr Corbyn, Mr Black urged the Labour leader to strike a balance in his comments and \"be a bit more critical of the other side\".He said: \"Fair enough, be critical of the government of Israel, but I never hear them criticising the likes of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Palestinian leaders.\"Labour has hit back at the Chief Rabbis claims and insisted: \"Jeremy Corbyn is a lelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile brexit health and investment highlighted as big issues on the road to election in fermanagh and south tyrone","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile no change likely in newry and armagh but some sinn fein voters ponder a switch to dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It has become a real laughing stock.\"One woman from nearby Warrenpoint who is among those who want to remain anonymous said people are more angry than confused.\"The parties just go for their own agenda rather than anything  and the ordinary people just have to put up with the state of hospitals and schools in decline and cuts left, right and centre,\" she said.Apart from the big ticket issues, the main local concern appears to be a vicious spate of break-ins which has plagued a number of towns and villages.And in Newtownhamilton there is palpable public outrage over proposals for a super-dump just outside the town which they fear would involve hundreds of tonnes of non-recyclable waste.Nonetheless Brexit appears to be front and centre in most peoples minds and the issue they hope most the election will finally sort out.Mr Brady has attacked Boris Johnson over his recent visit to Tayto Castle in Tandragee without informing him - although Downing Street insisted the election means MPs no longer have to be told.\"He sneaked into Tandragee on an unannounced visit, but he cant escape the fact that the majority of people in the north have rejected the reckless Tory Brexit,\" he said.\"He may want to avoid the people but he cant avoid the polls.\"Mr Johnson said he was unaware Mr Brady, who he referred to as \"the honourable member who does not take his seat\", had not been informed.Mr Irwin, meanwhile, has said he believes Brexit will have to be \"out of the way\" before the Assembly can be restored, but believes EU withdrawal will allow the regions agri-food sector to move towards self-sufficiency.The DUP candidate added: \"Being outside the EU and free from many of the bureaucratic burdens that come with the baggage of EU membership, it is certainly the case that our processors and retailers can source a much greater amount of food home grown within the UK.\"The UUPs Sam Nicholson, chair of the partys councillors association, will be hoping to mop up anti-DUP unionist votes along with unionist Remainers coalescing around new leader Steve Aikens position that staying in the EU is better than Johnsons deal to leave. He has pledged to put people at the very heart of policy in rebuilding his party \"from the grassroots up\".Though a largely rural area, it is the only constituency in Northern Ireland with two cities - Armagh and Newry - and only created less than  years ago, in  as a result of the increase of Northern Ireland seats from  to then . Newry was previously part of South Down.In the  census more than % identied as Irish in the constituency, just under % as British and just over % as Northern Irish.The area has the highest proportion of Latvian speakersin Northern Ireland, while almost % claim to have \"some ability\" in Irish.One name which might have been on the polling cards is independent Patrick Clarke who had announced his intention to run but had travelling dficulties and missed the nomination deadline."},{"url":null,"title":"byelection results show irish government is out of touch sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

public housing programme in decades, investment in public services and for planning for Irish unity.“The result is signicant for a number of reasons – it exposed a totally out of touch government

Now Maeve has come up with a novel idea to keep her on track with her training and boost her fundraising – it’s the Tedathon!We want people to pledge to walk, run, swim or cycle for K or  minutes each day during December,” says Maeve. “It’s only pound to join in so it’s a simple way both to raise money for a fantastic cause and to improve health and fitness during a month of over-indulgence. I’m lucky to have got a London Marathon place but I appreciate not everyone can do that. “However, anyone can join in the Tedathon I’ve got friends and family both here and overseas who have signed up. With a choice of a Tedathon medal , or a pair of glow in the dark lacesupon completion, I would loveas many people as possible could get on board and get Tedathon done!“To have a child suffer liver failure and go through transplant at such a young age is truly traumatic but Children’s Liver Disease Foundation have been there for us with information and emotional support all along. “We want every family in our situation to have that kind of support and this is my way of giving something back.” “I would not have been able to launch Tedathon without the support of Declan and Emma Leung at Virtual Run NI. They have provided guidance and ideas, and are designing the most amazing medals,” said Maeve. Declan said: “At Virtual Run NI, we want to encourage people to get fit and active, we want to motivate and encourage runners, and in this case walkers, cyclists and swimmers too! of all abilities and ages. We always reward all finishers with the most fantastic medals and we are really excited about our Tedathon medal!”Jacqueline Mc Gonigle, Chair of Termoneeny Running Club said: “We are proud to support Tedathon, and would encourage all runners, walkers, swimmers, and cyclists to sign up for this very worthy challenge.  Termoneeny Running Club is only too happy to promote this fundraiser, and have enjoyed coming up with lots of ideas to support Maeve and Tedathon. We wish Maeve all the best with her London marathon training.” Alison Taylor, Chief Executive of Children’s Liver Disease Foundation commented: “CLDF is the only UK charity dedicated to fighting all childhood liver diseases, by providing information and emotional support, funds for research and a voice for all those affected. In order to do this however, we rely on voluntary donations, so we are delighted to hear about the Tedathon. What a fantastic and fun way to get people involved in raising awareness and funds!” You can join in the Tedathon by going to http:bit.ly pizK.For more information on CLDF visit childliverdisease.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

CONAL McFEELY says the findings have been both enlightening and compelling. In his seminal book, ‘Derry: Countdown to Disaster’ , the former Derry Journal editor Frank Curran catalogued how fty years of isolation and discrimination led to the outbreak of the Troubles in this city. Recent events, such as the failure of political governance, the collapse of the institutions, and the uncertainty over Brexit here, are being used by some sections of the media to suggest we are now in danger of a similar spiral. googletag.cmd.push The reality on the ground in communities such as Creggan is that there is, admittedly, huge frustration. Despite the peace process, Creggan - along with many already disadvantaged areas of Derry – has never escaped a legacy of endemic poverty, joblessness, housing problems and low educational attainment. This is now compounded by anxiety over Brexitand the political vacuum here, which has left many people feeling voiceless and powerless. But, for all the dissatisfaction and exasperation here, there is no appetite whatsoever on the ground for ato what our community experienced during the troubles. googletag.cmd.push There is no doubt, however, that we need help. Urgently. And, importantly, we need long-term solutions – not short-term fixes – to reverse and redress the politics of economic isolation. Local people know of old that it is pointless waiting on Stormont to intervene on our behalf. Even in the new, post-Good Friday Agreement era of equality, this city overall has continued to experience economic isolation.  So, what is needed for Creggan   Surveys conducted at Rath Mor over Autumn  established, the community wants: middot A fresh, current and strategic vision for the area. Creggan needs a comprehensive long-term plan to reassess and revise its approach to community development with a view to enhancing the physical, mental, economic, educational and social well-being of its residents. middot Support for community infrastructure, capital and physical environment projects to help address social and economic exclusion, improve community image, grow new business, tackle poverty, advocate for those in need, create new employment and stimulate social innovation. middot Support for a targeted social enterprise strategy to promote civic engagement and community ownership. Creggan will always struggle to attract inward investment, instead we need a viable stimulus package for indigenous business. The ethos is not just about developing sustainable businesses – it is about contributing to the social and economic profits for the advantage and benefit of the local community. middot Support for a new Intermediate Labour Market initiative. Creggan needs a dedicated ILM scheme – providing sustainable jobs and experience, skills and qualications which are most in demand by employers. The scheme should be highly focused on helping those iniduals most in need, and most at risk. middot Support for inclusive development vehicles. It is imperative that any new support service, or targeted employment or skills building initiative be inclusive and independent. It must be implemented delivered by a neutral mechanism, engage with all sides of the community and be pragmatic about removing barriers to work and supporting personal transition. middot Continued support for health and wellbeing initiatives. Creggan suffers from a range of signicant physical and mental health challenges, and despite this Creggan has been devoid of a dedicated doctor’s surgery for over  years. Creggan Enterprises have been working diligently to bringing this service provision to the area for the last decade. January  will see the realization of this new flagship health project for the community in partnership with Bayview Medical. Government or independent funding support should be directed at these types of projects which provide meaningful, tangible and most importantly sustainable benefits to the community. middot Support for schools, families and young people. Creggan needs targeted and focused early years, youth and parentalprevention and intervention programmes which are fully inclusive and engage those most in need, at risk, marginalised or excluded from existing provision. middot Support for programmes which engage the elderly, address social isolation and support those most vulnerable in our community to the impacts of poverty, austerity and cuts as a result of failure in political governance. middot Support for inclusive community dialogue. Without the opportunity and  for dialogue we are left with continuous community isions and conflict. And whilst Creggan has suffered very negative media coverage and ‘community profiling’ in recent times – there is a sustained need to develop viable community safety initiatives which are fully inclusive an accountable to everyone. middot Support for initiatives which deal with the past. At the centre of much of Cregganinter and intra-community conflict – is the community’s inability to tackle legacy conflict issues – lacking an effective mechanism for dealing with the past. middot Support for new educational and cultural partnerships. Creggan over the past few years has been hosting regular Summer School schemes for international visitors – as has partnered on peacebuilding projects with the likes of Yale University, Boston College, Temple University, John Moore and many more – tying in with their political science, international studies or peacebuilding  conflict studies courses. We would seek to broaden out this offering and formalise this Summer School as a standalone initiative. Creggan, and Derry in general, needs a st century recovery programme, particularly in light of the potential catastrophic impact of Brexit on the North West. And whilst financing, job creation and early intervention prevention-based work is at the core of any important proposal – every effective development plan needs flagship projects to stimulate public interest, generate healthy debate and communicate a vision, for example: A new, independently-run university Derry needs a new university. A new, independently-run university – which would come under the auspices of the National University of Ireland and be supported by the Irish government – is one certain way to begin redressing the balance. It would also serve as a beacon of hope for those who cannot see their future in this city – and it would serve as a declaration of intent of the Irish government’s commitment to Good Friday Agreement. A university’s letime can run into centuries – Derry, this island’s most ancient Christian settlement, needs a guarantee of its longevity and of a prosperous future. Regardless of what happens after any election now or next year – we must ensure that our young people have access to enhanced economic and educational opportunities going forward. Time is long overdue to address community abandonment and short-termism by central government.

Born with spina bida and hydrocephalus , seven-year-old Seanain McCallion and her family have been regular users of Hospice services since Seanain was just  months old and this festive season she is wishing for donations to ensure young people affected by le-limiting conditions across Northern Ireland can avail of these leline services. Seanain, who requires -hour care, has received a new diagnosis each year of her le and will undergo further surgery next month. Cold weather further exasperates Seanain’s symptoms and as a result she is often ill over the Christmas period. As it is her favourite time of year, the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice threw an early Christmas party for Seanain in June so she could celebrate the holiday with her family. Seanain’s mum, Kathleen, said: “Seanain loves fairytales and dressing up so you can imagine the delight on her face when she arrived at the party to be met by Elsa and Anna, the princesses from Disney’s Frozen. “She had an amazing day singing her heart out to all her favourite Disney songs with her sisters Grace and Chloe, and really feeling like a princess for the day. It was a magical day for the whole family to have such a precious day together. “We are so grateful to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice for arranging the party and allowing us to make wonderful memories together.”The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice further surprised Seanain by creating an animated Princess character of the youngster. “The Princess Seanain character looks fantastic. She has a wheelchair, glasses, dark hair and a big smile, just like Seanain. It was another incredible surprise,” Kathleen continued. The Northern Ireland’s Children’s Hospice is the only children’s Hospice in Northern Ireland and cares for young people of all ages including babies. Kathleen said: “When we were first referred to the Hospice that was very daunting as there is a misconception that Hospice services are only suitable for those at the end of le. How wrong that is! “The Hospice has honestly opened a whole new world for us and we feel incredibly lucky to have the security net for support when we need it most. “As Seanain gets older her needs are increasing and as her main carer it can be extremely exhausting. When Seanain goes to the Hospice to stay for a couple of days, she absolutely loves it and looks forward to it like other kids look forward to weekend sleepovers.“The staff go above and beyond and are on hand to cater for each and every one of Seanain’s needs. It’s incredible how relaxed we are to leave her overnight because we know that she just loves being there, and for my husband and I, having that alone time together is really important. “The care provided is amazing, and not just to Seanain but to her siblings and the entire family. It feels like a second home to us all. It’s a place where Seanain gets to have fun and live as normal a le as possible. She is such a bright spark and is determined to control her disability rather than let it control her. “The Hospice needs to raise huge amounts of money every year to continue providing these services to children like Seanain and I really hope that people can support the Hospice and make a donation of whatever they can afford this Christmas.” Kathleen is hoping that  will be a healthier year for Seanain following next months surgery. Heather Weir, chief executive at Northern Ireland Hospice said: “Seanain is a very special girl and we are just thrilled she enjoyed her early Christmas party and her Princess animation so much. “It is a pleasure to have her staying in the Hospice and we’re very proud to have her feature in our Little Stars Christmas Appeal encouraging donations for the Hospice. “It costs pound. million each year for Northern Ireland Hospice to provide high level palliative care and support to people of all ages across Northern Ireland, in their homes and in our specialist facilities. Only % of that is received through statutory funding which means we rely on fundraising efforts for the remaining pound million. “To put these figures in perspective, it costs pound. for us to deliver one hour of nursing care in the Children’s Hospice and pound. would cover the cost of  minutes of specialist Hospice care to accompany children in the multi-sensory room or in our hydrotherapy pool. “I hope that raising awareness of the breadth of services we offer at Hospice, will encourage people to make a donation which can go towards care for children with le-limiting conditions such as Seanain.”To make a once-off or recurring donation, or to find out how you can get involved with a fundraising event of your own please visit www.nihospice.org googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It aims to provide transparency around the business of Community Planning and the performance of the statutory and support partners tasked with its delivery.The report was launched at a meeting of the Strategic Growth Partnership in the Guildhall, where it was widely welcomed by the local stakeholders who have been working in conjunction with Council since the power of Community Planning was handed down in .The Statement contains positive indications that change is already beginning to take effect in seven out of the eight outcome areas prioritised in the plan, with progress occurring at a faster rate than expected.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, welcomed the Statement and acknowledged the tangible results that have already been achieved. “I am delighted to see the many indicators of positive change within the Statement of Progress,” she declared. This is of course a long term strategy and there are many signicant challenges that will take time to address before we can enjoy the full benefits of real and lasting change. There is a long way to go, but the foundations have been laid through this process towards achieving a bright and positive future – we just need to maintain this momentum to fully achieve the level of prosperity and wellbeing we all aspire to.”Council chief executive, John Kelpie, said strong partnership working had been the main driver of progress. “From the outset we have been ambitious in our approach and I am reassured that the results confirm that this has been the right strategy to initiate positive change. In terms of active delivery progress is more signicant and visible than we expected at this stage.”The Statement of Progress reveals a changing picture in Derry and Strabane since the Inclusive Strategic Growth Plan was first published in November . In terms of the local economy the City and District saw its highest jobs figure to date in  as we begin to close the gap with the N. Ireland average in our employment rate. While there are still gaps with regards to job creation and skills development work continues to get more people working in better jobs.The latest figures also show a high level of academic performance at GCSE and A-Level and overall academic performance, while growth has occurred in areas such as tourism with more overnight trips, visits and expenditure.Environmental wellbeing has also improved, with decreases in Co emissions, an increase of % in our household waste recycling rate, improvements in our parks and green spaces, and further development in terms of our roads infra- structure, greenways and the opening of the multi-modal transport hub. Work continues on the new Local Development Plan which will shape planning policy for the better, improving the quality of the environment around us. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These studies show that bi-lingual children achieve higher levels in literacy and numeracy than their mono-lingual peers - including in English. They are better able to learn additional languages, and are more open to other cultures as a result.Bilingual children demon- strate additional creativity, as their brain develops in a way that encourages lateral thinking, and finally, they are also more adept in social situations, as they are used to switching codes in dferent settings, and are more socially confident as a result.There is the added advantage of developing fluency in an indigenous language unique to Ireland, and there are additional cultural advantages to attending Irish medium education, in terms of access to traditional music, sport, heritage and culture, as well as additional employment opportunities in the growing Irish language community across the island.It goes without saying that Irish medium schools welcome children of all backgrounds.On top of this, Club Oacuteige Setanta  provides a wide range of out of school facilities for Irish speaking children in the city both within and outside of term time. This dovetails with Irish language summer camps for children attending Irish medium schools, as well as special activities for St Patricks Day, Halloween, Christmas and Easter. The club currently has  children enrolled, and is in the process of developing its own purpose built premises. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whether its little Alex here and his impromptu Irish conversation, or an over-excited child flying by before Ryan has even said their name, thewheeled section of the show is often its finest moment! Ryan will repeatedly and aggressively poke a toy with a microphone...  When it doesnt work first time around, he iniably gives it a good whack. It usually starts singing or doing what its supposed to when hes moved on to the next segment. A child will meet their hero...  In this case, Evelyn Cusackwas the star and Johnnys mind was blown. Its always nice when RTE break out the superstars. googletag.cmd.push An audience member in antlers will have too much free wine...  Theyre an excitable bunch, the Toy Show audience. Full of Christmas spirit , there is always one dancing like a tipsy aunt at a wedding - arms waving, beckoning to a mortied friend to join in. Everyone will get sick of the posh kids...  via GIPHY- There will always bedemonstrators suspected of being somebodys kids. Theyll be over confident with too much to say for themselves. They will have notiony names like Evangeline - always! A child will get severe stage fright...  In fairness to young Toby here, he was after singing in front of the nation and then got the stage fright when Girls Aloud had sneaked up on him. Poor fella closed up shop then and Pat went to an ad break in . googletag.cmd.push Well all get jealous of the audience getting a load of stuff...  We love nothing more than when the audience on the Toy Show get shockingly bad prizes like a bar of soap or something. Start dishing out new phones and trips away, and were up in arms! Ryan will call a toy a thinginy bob...  In his usual goofy madcap style, Ryan will utter these words when discussing some newfangled toy. He might give a thinginy bob to the audience. Sales are slow... The presence or absence of the Billie Barry Kids will get a mention...  Once a mainstay, the Billie Barry Stage School are often still missed on the Toy Show. Someone will bring it up and ide opinion with the family member who never really liked them anyway. Someone will say these words: It wasnt as good as other years...  via GIPHY Thats just my opinion. The credits roll and the analysis begins. Bottom line is - it will never be as good as it was when we were kids. But we still love it!

This reflects the unpredictable nature of flu, which is why it is important to get the vaccine to maximise protection. “Receiving the seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to help protect yourself and others from getting the virus, so we are calling on everyone who is eligible to make arrangements now to get ityou haven’t already Those who can receive it for free through GP surgeries include people with an underlying health condition, people aged over , pregnant women and pre-schoolers aged -. googletag.cmd.push “Primary school children get the vaccine through their school, so we would also encourage parents to make sure they have ed their consent forms for this. Respiratory illnesses such as colds and flu, as well as other illnesses such as vomiting and diarrhoea, can be very common at this time of year.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house. So far she is doing well and enjoying her new le in Downpatrick.Jasmine was asked her to leave her home earlier this year. Her parents have not been in her le for some time.ldquoLiving in Downpatrick is alright. Irsquove actually made a few friends outside the hostel which makes me happy, said Jasmine.ldquoThere was a breakdown in the family relationship. I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He spent hours there every Saturday morning overseeing the mini rugby scene and, as Mr Forde said, everything was done meticulously. “He was the driving force at Chambers Park and his work had a tremendous influence on the lives of so many young people.”Willie had won a host of awards for his rugby work over the years and this was capped last year when he was awarded the British Empire Medal for his work for rugby and the Panthers in particular. Only this year his son, Barry, who paid a moving tribute to his dad, was also awarded the British Empire Medal.Former Portadown Times editor David Armstrong said, “Willie did so much to put mini-rugby on the map.“I worked closely with him when he was pushing to have the game publicised and, as Mr Forde said, he was meticulous in his approach to everything.“I have many happy memories of working with Willie and one of his many qualities was that he never spoke ill of anyone.”Seagoe rector, the Rev Terence Cadden, joined in the tributes and he said the thoughts and prayers of so many people were with Willie’s family – his we, Edna, son Barry, daughter Karen. grandchildrenBrendan, Toby, Poppy, Cassie, Drew.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal.
