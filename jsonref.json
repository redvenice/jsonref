A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram. There have been so many lovely messages.           Fogle offered to cancel his own ascent in solidarity but Pendelton insisted he continue to the summit with the others\u0027I am sorry that I haven\u0027t been able to reply to you all but I promise you I read your messages and once this adventure is over I will endeavour to reply to you all.\u0027Cradling little Willem to say goodbye, I made a promise to him to live my life brightly. To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/11/4C58CACC00000578-5739861-image-a-13_1526552773853.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles trusted circle Pictures women friends fly UK big day","story":"    While her family tears itself apart in the days before her wedding, Meghan Markle can at least rely on her trusted girl squad who have flown to the UK for her big day.

I’d done a student film for her when we were in university together, so she gave him the film the next day.‘He called me and said, “You’re going to make money, and I want to take 10 per cent”.

It\u0027s just a little sexist ...‘There needs to be a certain sense of equality where a woman is not just a plus-one, you know. It\u0027s nice to be your own identity, too.’But she appears to have accepted them as a team: in a recent poll published by Time magazine she hailed both Meghan and Harry as ‘leaders’.

It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle. Some royal insiders have also questioned whether Prince Charles might step in to do the honours.  How Meghan Markle\u0027s estranged family have turned the wedding into a VERY colourful affair Tracey Dooley, 52The recovering alcoholic, who sells advertising was once married to Meghan\u0027s half brother, Thomas Markle Jr.She was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas, and are in the UK to conduct a round of interviews - even though she hasn\u0027t seen Meghan for around 20 years. She is documenting her stay in London on a Facebook page \u0027Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles\u0027 where she has uploaded a selection of pictures of famous landmarks.

And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/14/4C661F4100000578-5742749-image-a-57_1526650912733.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry smile and wave as they leave their Kensington Palace home to head to Windsor today.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.          Police marksmen on the ground and on rooftops have to do \u0027whatever it takes\u0027 to keep people safe tomorrowIn return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

Everyone will already know most of what to expect as the order of service is being released at midnight on Friday.1pmThe newlyweds will emerge about an hour later at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running.

Bacillus subtilis are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some mammals. They generally do not cause disease but have been known to cause septicaemia in a patient with leukaemia.Bacillus is more dangerous and has links with a wide range of infections including meningitis, abscesses and septicaemia.          Swabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis. Micro-organisms were detected in all of the filters tested at London Metropolitan UniversityA car’s air con works by mixing fresh air from outside with a refrigerant and the mixture turns into liquid as it is cooled. It is then turned into vapour as it travels through evaporation coils and blown into the cabin as cool air. It is the evaporator in the system that provides perfect conditions for bacteria, mould and fungi to build up and thrive. Although the car filter will prevent many pollutants entering the passenger compartment, it will not stop all micro-organisms.The research was commissioned by Kwik Fit, which urged drivers to clean their air conditioning systems at least once every two years.On average, the test found 1.6 different strains of mico-organisms within the filters.Drivers in Plymouth had the most contaminated cars, with an average of 2.3 varieties of micro-organism per vehicle. Dundee closely followed, with each filter having on average two strains of micro-organism.Coming in just under the overall average figure and at the bottom of the table was Cardiff, with an average of one type of micro-organism per filter tested.Dr Paul Matewele, a senior lecturer specialising in microbiology at London Metropolitan, said: ‘Some of the bacteria found has links to animals, the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some infections that could cause a lot of harm to iniduals, especially those with a compromised immune system.‘The study highlights that air conditioning systems are suitable breeding grounds for bacteria and therefore underlines the importance of cleaning and replacing filters.‘I’m sure if car owners knew what they were blowing out of their air conditioning vents they would think twice before switching them on this summer.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C60D7DE00000578-0-image-m-26_1526600041047.jpg","title":"Britain double military presence Afghanistan send extra 400 troops","story":"    An extra 400 military personnel could be sent to the war zone as part of a Nato training mission.

Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027  The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him.            Prince William is seen leaving Windsor Castle during the final preparations for Saturday\u0027s royal wedding          William and Kate were also photographed leaving Kensington Palace as they joined the couple in Windsor for rehearsalsHilarious video as man tumbles down set of steps into ThamesHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVCCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal wedding\u0027The whole car went up in a FIREBALL\u0027: BMW customer\u0027s shock experienceSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleThomas Markle (pictured this week) is recovering after he had three stentsMeghan Markle\u0027s father is \u0027alone and upset\u0027 in hospital after undergoing heart surgery.Thomas Markle is recovering after he had three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago and said: \u0027It will take a long time to heal\u0027. Mr Markle told TMZ last night: \u0027I\u0027m okay. Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited\u0027 and his children said he is \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to miss the wedding.Mr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation.His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery.But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family said he had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.   It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle. Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal. I\u0027m okay. Staying in the hospital a few more days.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningHilarious video as man tumbles down set of steps into ThamesCCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal wedding\u0027The whole car went up in a FIREBALL\u0027: BMW customer\u0027s shock experienceSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.Hilarious video as man tumbles down set of steps into ThamesRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal wedding\u0027The whole car went up in a FIREBALL\u0027: BMW customer\u0027s shock experienceSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C61342200000578-0-image-m-21_1526601358781.jpg","title":"Kate Osamor caught plagiarising Barack Obamas acceptance speech","story":"Kate Osamor (pictured right) used a chunk of Barack Obama\u0027s speech to hail her own reelection to Edmonton in last year\u0027s election Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accuses EU of trying to...Share this articleShe said: \u0027If there is anyone out there who doubts that Edmonton is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of hope is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\u0027It\u0027s the answer told by the lines of people stretched around polling stations, schools and churches. \u0027By young people who queued, many for the first time in their lives because they believed that voting for Labour this time must be different, that their voices could be the difference.\u0027 The section is virtually identical to Mr Obama\u0027s speech in his hometown of Chicago after he was elected President for the first time.He told the crowd: \u0027If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.

These momentous events always bring the entire elephant family together and we expect to see the other young calves in the group showing a lot of interest in the little one over the coming days, weeks and months.

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/18/4C6888F700000578-0-image-a-133_1526664553883.jpg","title":"Is African lodge called Shipwreck Prince Harry Meghan Markles honeymoon destination","story":"    Desolate: Shipwreck Lodge\u0027s design is based on the vessels washed up on the Namibian shoreAnd sources have told the Mail that £800-a-night Shipwreck Lodge, a new luxury hideaway in the remote spot, is being tipped as the couple’s venue of choice.

Instead, they’ll stay in the UK to attend Prince Charles’s 70th birthday celebrations on Tuesday. There are also plans for a trip to Dublin within weeks.          Luxury: Guest chalets at the lodge in Namibia feature breathtaking views of the oceanIndeed, their joint schedules are so busy over the coming months that some have predicted August is the earliest they will be able to escape. Last month, a local wrote on Facebook: ‘A little birdie told me that Prince Harry and Meghan are here for their honeymoon.’A spokesman for the lodge, Anica Britz, did not deny claims that Harry and Meghan might soon be jetting in, but said: ‘Unfortunately we cannot comment on or confirm the rumours that the royal couple will be staying at Shipwreck Lodge.’ Sources say Namibia – and the arresting landscape of the Skeleton Coast – is certainly top of Harry and Meghan’s list. Africa is a continent close to their hearts: both have done extensive charity and conservation work here and neighbouring Botswana was the location of one of their early dates, as well as a whirlwind holiday to mark Meghan’s 36th birthday last August. It will also appeal to their love of wildlife: Namibia is home to the world’s largest free-roaming black rhino population and Harry is a passionate animal-lover and anti-poaching campaigner.He has travelled to Namibia in the past. With ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he canoed the Orange River in 2006 and missed Princess Charlotte’s christening in 2015 because he was working with rhino conservationists. Also said to be on the royal wish list is the enchanting opportunity to watch wildlife by moonlight at a waterhole in Ongava, a game reserve on the edge of the Etosha National Park. Visitors can watch leopards, rhinos, lions and zebras coming and going in near silence. Shipwreck Lodge, which is owned by the local government in conjunction with three upmarket travel agencies, has a number of activities on offer for any adventurous couple. Locals admit access is ‘tricky’ – making it perfect for this publicity-shy pair.

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, William chose not to wear a wedding ring while Kate didIts popularity increased as the decades passed and as it became more fashionable for men to wear jewellery.In contrast to other royal men, the Prince of Wales does wear a wedding band, under a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand. There may be an element of social class at play for men who decide not to wear a wedding ring as those from the upper classes are said not to like jewellery.The Queen Mother began the tradition of royal wedding rings being made from Welsh gold after the precious metal was used to make her wedding band when she married in 1923.One nugget of gold was used to make the Queen Mother\u0027s wedding ring, the Queen\u0027s in 1947, Princess Margaret\u0027s in 1960, the Princess Royal\u0027s in 1973 and that of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981.  The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured on his wedding day in November 1947 with the then Princess Elizabeth, is from the generation which traditionally did not wear wedding ringsThe gold came from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine. There is now only a minute sliver, one gram (0.035oz), of the original nugget left.In November 1981, the British Royal Legion presented the Queen with a 36-gram (1.3oz) piece of 21-carat Welsh gold for future royal wedding rings.The Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s wedding ring was also crafted from Welsh gold from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine and the river Mawddach in the King\u0027s Forest.It was handmade in court style by Wartski and the precious metal was supplied by Cambrian Goldfields Limited."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/00/4C69B58700000578-0-image-m-43_1526686746482.jpg","title":"PICTURED Team florists getting church wedding ready stunning floral arrangements","story":"    Florists were last night busily applying the finishing touches to a glorious floral archway outside 15th century gothic St George\u0027s Chapel           Workers darted up and down ladders ahead of the royal wedding tomorrow while colleagues nearby were tending to huge boxes of flowers that will adorn the magnificent venueThe floral array has been carefully crafted by Fulham-based floral designer - and the preferred supplier to Kensington Palace - Philippa Craddock.It was revealed in March that Craddock had been hand-picked by the couple to deck out Windsor in stunning blooms for their May 19 nuptials. Described by Tatler as \u0027a floral mastermind\u0027, Philippa claims to be able to create any bride\u0027s dream from \u0027a secret garden in a palace\u0027 to \u0027an outdoor botanical romance\u0027.But while floral arches by and large sell for around £500 for the average wedding, it is likely the royal couple\u0027s cost in excess of £1,500.Steeped in history, the 15th century gothic chapel offers Harry and Meghan a slightly more intimate venue for their wedding, but one that is still appropriately grand.

There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningHilarious video as man tumbles down set of steps into ThamesCCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal wedding\u0027The whole car went up in a FIREBALL\u0027: BMW customer\u0027s shock experienceSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.Hilarious video as man tumbles down set of steps into ThamesRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportCCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landHappy couple gets married in Windsor a day before Royal wedding\u0027The whole car went up in a FIREBALL\u0027: BMW customer\u0027s shock experienceSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans offer Harry and Meghan marriage advice on eve of weddingThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people.

In fact, both were under eight years old when their separated parents orced. Yet both emerged as strong mothers described by their children as \u0027wonderful\u0027.Indeed, Princess Diana and Doria Ragland, one living in a palace in London, the other 5,500 miles away in a suburb of Los Angeles, even felt the same emotional urge to take their children to deprived areas where they could see just how difficult life was for those with virtually nothing.EXCLUSIVE: How Meghan Markle¿s ancestor was one of the...Princess Diana refused to wear Chanel shoes after orce...Share this articleBoth women married men who were 12 years their senior — and both marriages foundered.Diana, who would have been 57 on July 1 had she lived, was just 20 when she married the Prince of Wales at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in 1981.Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979.All the dreams, hopes and ambitions that now face their children, Harry and Meghan, faced them.          Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/18/4C6888F700000578-0-image-a-133_1526664553883.jpg","title":"Is African lodge called Shipwreck Prince Harry Meghan Markles honeymoon destination","story":"    Desolate: Shipwreck Lodge\u0027s design is based on the vessels washed up on the Namibian shoreAnd sources have told the Mail that £800-a-night Shipwreck Lodge, a new luxury hideaway in the remote spot, is being tipped as the couple’s venue of choice.

Instead, they’ll stay in the UK to attend Prince Charles’s 70th birthday celebrations on Tuesday. There are also plans for a trip to Dublin within weeks.          Luxury: Guest chalets at the lodge in Namibia feature breathtaking views of the oceanIndeed, their joint schedules are so busy over the coming months that some have predicted August is the earliest they will be able to escape. Last month, a local wrote on Facebook: ‘A little birdie told me that Prince Harry and Meghan are here for their honeymoon.’A spokesman for the lodge, Anica Britz, did not deny claims that Harry and Meghan might soon be jetting in, but said: ‘Unfortunately we cannot comment on or confirm the rumours that the royal couple will be staying at Shipwreck Lodge.’ Sources say Namibia – and the arresting landscape of the Skeleton Coast – is certainly top of Harry and Meghan’s list. Africa is a continent close to their hearts: both have done extensive charity and conservation work here and neighbouring Botswana was the location of one of their early dates, as well as a whirlwind holiday to mark Meghan’s 36th birthday last August. It will also appeal to their love of wildlife: Namibia is home to the world’s largest free-roaming black rhino population and Harry is a passionate animal-lover and anti-poaching campaigner.He has travelled to Namibia in the past. With ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he canoed the Orange River in 2006 and missed Princess Charlotte’s christening in 2015 because he was working with rhino conservationists. Also said to be on the royal wish list is the enchanting opportunity to watch wildlife by moonlight at a waterhole in Ongava, a game reserve on the edge of the Etosha National Park. Visitors can watch leopards, rhinos, lions and zebras coming and going in near silence. Shipwreck Lodge, which is owned by the local government in conjunction with three upmarket travel agencies, has a number of activities on offer for any adventurous couple. Locals admit access is ‘tricky’ – making it perfect for this publicity-shy pair. Guests can charter a plane from the capital, Windhoek, or drive the five-and-a-half hours from Swakopmund to Mowe Bay themselves, after which the hotel provides guided 4x4s to cover the remaining two hours.          Insiders say builders are ‘frantically working to get it ready’ for the royal honeymoonersTheir nautically-themed accommodation features porthole windows and curved wooden beams.On the walls are vintage posters depicting the fates of vessels that have been wrecked, including the Dunedin Star – a cargo liner heading from Liverpool to Cape Town that ran aground in 1942.Day trips include excursions to the Mowe Bay seal colony, hyena-spotting at the Hoarusib River, sundowner cocktails in the spectacular dunes and treks to the homes of the nomadic Himba people.Rates rise to £1,450 in the August to mid-November peak season, although food and drink is included in the price, served by uniformed staff. Trespassers – and the lenses of passing paparazzi – will certainly be told to keep their distance.As well as the intimidating motifs on the gates, the entrance to the 146,600-hectare coastal area is fenced off with whale bones – and rusty metal ‘no entry’ signs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/23/4C68915100000578-0-image-m-30_1526684382761.jpg","title":"Modern man Harry wear wedding ring marrying Meghan Markle","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, wearing her engagement ring, hold hands at their engagement photocallWhen the Duke of Cambridge married, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh and uncle the Duke of York.They both chose to eschew the traditional symbol of marriage.Royal brides are given wedding rings made from gold nuggets from Clogau St David\u0027s mine at Bontddu in North Wales - and Ms Markle is expected to follow the tradition.Stand By Me, gospel choir, alternate vows and VERY modern...Perfect for a white hot wedding!

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, William chose not to wear a wedding ring while Kate didIts popularity increased as the decades passed and as it became more fashionable for men to wear jewellery.In contrast to other royal men, the Prince of Wales does wear a wedding band, under a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand. There may be an element of social class at play for men who decide not to wear a wedding ring as those from the upper classes are said not to like jewellery.The Queen Mother began the tradition of royal wedding rings being made from Welsh gold after the precious metal was used to make her wedding band when she married in 1923.One nugget of gold was used to make the Queen Mother\u0027s wedding ring, the Queen\u0027s in 1947, Princess Margaret\u0027s in 1960, the Princess Royal\u0027s in 1973 and that of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981.  The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured on his wedding day in November 1947 with the then Princess Elizabeth, is from the generation which traditionally did not wear wedding ringsThe gold came from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine. There is now only a minute sliver, one gram (0.035oz), of the original nugget left.In November 1981, the British Royal Legion presented the Queen with a 36-gram (1.3oz) piece of 21-carat Welsh gold for future royal wedding rings.The Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s wedding ring was also crafted from Welsh gold from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine and the river Mawddach in the King\u0027s Forest.It was handmade in court style by Wartski and the precious metal was supplied by Cambrian Goldfields Limited."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/00/4C69B58700000578-0-image-m-43_1526686746482.jpg","title":"PICTURED Team florists getting church wedding ready stunning floral arrangements","story":"    Florists were last night busily applying the finishing touches to a glorious floral archway outside 15th century gothic St George\u0027s Chapel           Workers darted up and down ladders ahead of the royal wedding tomorrow while colleagues nearby were tending to huge boxes of flowers that will adorn the magnificent venueThe floral array has been carefully crafted by Fulham-based floral designer - and the preferred supplier to Kensington Palace - Philippa Craddock.It was revealed in March that Craddock had been hand-picked by the couple to deck out Windsor in stunning blooms for their May 19 nuptials. Described by Tatler as \u0027a floral mastermind\u0027, Philippa claims to be able to create any bride\u0027s dream from \u0027a secret garden in a palace\u0027 to \u0027an outdoor botanical romance\u0027.But while floral arches by and large sell for around £500 for the average wedding, it is likely the royal couple\u0027s cost in excess of £1,500.Steeped in history, the 15th century gothic chapel offers Harry and Meghan a slightly more intimate venue for their wedding, but one that is still appropriately grand.

Judge Lorien Kite called it “witty, wise and constantly surprising” and “a delicate, historically nuanced portrait of Britain in the age of Brexit”. Cordelia Fine’s Testosterone Rex, an examination of the science behind gender bias that won the 2017 Royal Society science book prize, was also picked for the shortlist, alongside Christopher de Bellaigue’s The Islamic Enlightenment, a history of reformations in Islamic countries during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mark Mazower is also shortlisted for his memoir about his family’s roots in Russia, What You Did Not Tell, alongside Darren McGarvey’s Poverty Safari, an investigation into Britain’s most deprived communities and Clair Wills’s Lovers and Strangers, a history of immigrants in Britain.Kite, a journalist for the Financial Times, said the six titles “together illustrate the vigour and variety of political writing in our tumultuous times”.“Brexit, immigration, revolution, gender, poverty, the Middle East – the dominant themes were always clear, but so too was the range of approaches deployed by this year’s Orwell prize entries. History, fiction, memoir and science are all represented in our shortlist, six titles that succeed in quite different ways,” said Kite, who is joined on the judging panel by the politician and academic Andrew Adonis, the literary journalist Alex Clark and the novelist Kit de Waal.The winner will be announced on 25 June, Orwell’s 115th birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc80e9ab23b3f9453bc65cd37d368fd322eafeea/0_2172_5726_3433/master/5726.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb1cfe0cc21325a996bb031269d4380","title":"smiggle laughing all the way to the bank after uk expansion","story":"Australian retailer with sights on kids’ pocket money has pursued aggressive expansion in the UK“I was in Smiggle and my mum said ‘I wish there were some chairs’ but other than that Smiggle is amazing,” is the professional assessment of the eight-year-old budding retail analyst Bridie O’Brien.Her father, Patrick, a retail expert at the GlobalData consultancy, had called on his daughter’s expertise as the London schoolgirl is exactly the target customer of the Australian chain that has taken the UK by storm over the last four years. While many other UK retailers are feeling the squeeze and shutting shops, Smiggle’s British sales nearly doubled to £56m last year and its profits surged from £3.3m to £10.8m, according to accounts filed this month. The retailer, best-known for its fluorescent notebooks and sweet-smelling pencils and rubbers, has pursued an aggressive store-opening plan since arriving on British shores in 2014. Earlier this month, Smiggle (where a smile meets a giggle) made its debut on Oxford Street in London with a two-storey tween temple twice the size of its other stores. “We try and be a wholesome alternative to the dreaded screen,” explains John Cheston, the retailer’s Melbourne-based managing director, who is in the UK for the high-profile store opening. “We get a lot of goodwill out of that.”Smiggle is after children’s pocket money with its sights trained on the stationery needs, scented or otherwise, of children aged five to 14. It’s a bigger market opportunity than you’d think, with Sheffield-born Cheston revealing that some children turn up at his shops in affluent Surrey with a crisp £50 note to spend. “It’s not unusual for kids to have pocket money of £20, £30, £40 a week,” he says. “We have some stores where kids get £50 a week and come in with a £50 note.”“One of the greatest things about our brand is that it transcends all demographics,” says the 51-year-old, who describes himself as a “northern kid who came from nothing”. “There’s the little girl who is at a private prep school, has got a horse and her parents are doing really well, and she loves Smiggle,” says Cheston. “At the other end there’s kids from broken homes, who see their parent every few weeks, and when asked what do you want to do? will say: ‘I’d like to go to McDonald’s for a happy meal, see the latest Pixar animated film and go to Smiggle’.”Cheston, who started his career with a traineeship at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, has masterminded the stationery brand’s assault on the cutthroat UK market. In doing so he has put to shame the efforts of his countrymen from Wesfarmers who have crashed and burned and had to write off £500m following their disastrous £340m acquisition of Homebase. Smiggle is one of several brands owned by Just Group, a subsidiary of Premier Investments, run by retail billionaire Solomon Lew. It is the only brand that Just Group has exported to the UK and its success comes at a time when many homegrown retailers, from Mothercare to New Look, Carpetright and House of Fraser are struggling.Cheston, who regularly clocks up 30,000 steps a day patrolling shopping centres and competitors’ stores, says: “We did a massive amount of reconnaissance before we committed to coming here.”Cheston reckoned it would get sales of $A200m (£111m) within five years, a plan expected to involve 200 store openings. It remains on track to hit that sales target, but with 130 stores in the bag and another dozen in the pipeline it may slow the pace of openings after being surprised by the success of its website. “Online blew us away because kids don’t have credit cards right?” says Cheston. The problems faced by other retailers mean there is downward pressure on retail rents. “If we wanted to get to 200 stores the deals in Grimsby or Wolverhampton would be a lot more compelling than a year ago, because of people shuttering stores,” he explains. “But if you are a brand that wants prime sites it’s harder. I don’t want to be the last man with the lights on when everyone else is walking away.”Despite her passion for Smiggle, Bridie O’Brien is not without criticism of the brand. In particular, she has an issue with some of the prices – £18 for pencil cases and £33 for a backpack, for example. “I think that they could bring the prices down,” she wrote. The frenzy around the brand in the early days, which Cheston likens to Beatlemania, has also been blamed for playground squabbles, with some teachers complaining its expensive novelty gear is distracting, leading to classroom bans – including at Bridie’s school. Cheston is undeterred: “I think anything that entices children to want to go to school is a good thing. There is a bigger issue with kids with mobile phones. “If the biggest problem in the world today is a scented pencil case and a pencil that changes colour then the world’s gone mad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6971c15c879f14c2a7893db9d5453e1942a384e/0_7_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918caeb76c8be80094d523559d13c250","title":"children stressed social media parents","story":"Poor Twiglet the dog. Her short-lived career as a comfort animal for anxious Cambridge university students ended prematurely this week, after unprecedented demand to take her out for soothing walks left her feeling rather overanxious herself. At her peak, the jack russell was being booked out for eight hours a day, which says something about stress levels approaching finals.We are now well into education’s annual slough of despond: primary school Sats finished this week GCSEs have just begun A-levels and finals are next. Exams have always been, and will always be, stressful. What’s new is the cliff-edge feeling surrounding them: a paralysing fear of failure, combined with an ever-rising threshold for success that leaves too many children convinced it would be the end of the world to slip a grade.It’s tough even for resilient kids, but for those who are already prone to anxiety it’s hellish.Primary school teachers are having to reassure 10- and 11-year-olds that their futures won’t be irrevocably decided by Sats, which were only ever intended as a test of schools and not of children. Secondary school teachers describe panic attacks, children crying in class, and a rampaging anxiety among GCSE students who are once again guinea pigs in some education secretary’s politically driven experiment. This time, it’s Michael Gove’s legacy to the nation: super-rigorous “gold standard” exams. No more coursework, and a new numbered grading system that replaces the old A and A* – already beyond most kids’ reach – with new grades 7, 8 and 9. The line between 8 and 9 must be so fine now as to be irrelevant to almost all employers – yet the most perfectionist, anxious, overachieving kids (not to mention the most ambitious parents) will feel it matters and those are precisely the kids to worry about.Meanwhile the fear of failure that drives some to revise until 1am is also, in a different way, driving the kids who switch off school entirely because they know they can’t do this. And all to what end, exactly? Who is really rooting for this new academic Hunger Games, beyond people who took their own O-levels so long ago they’ve no idea what it’s like now?We are told it’s to prepare kids for an increasingly competitive world. But it’s unclear how early failure to master JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls on the one hand, or risking burnout for a 9 grade on the other, relates to the problems kids will face on leaving school: fewer good jobs available for the less academically able, as routine work is increasingly automated and casualised, plus uncertainty over Brexit and an economy past its productive peak that isn’t yet sure where the next one’s coming from.Too many kids, meanwhile, are perfectly aware even from primary school of what they’re supposedly up against. Even getting a degree no longer feels like enough in an increasingly competitive workplace, so the pressure students put themselves under to get firsts has increased exponentially. Speculation that an increase in students getting firsts must be down to grade inflation, or universities trying to please their now-paying customers, wilfully ignores the fact that these kids are visibly pushing themselves harder than their predecessors – and not just academically. Every holiday is stuffed with high-octane work experience and CV-building activities. When I went back to my old college recently, half of the bar had been turned into a coffee area: they don’t loll around boozing like we did but bring their laptops in and work. Oh, and there’s now a dedicated mental health nurse.Having seen too many contemporaries realise only in their 30s that the anxiety they’d struggled with for years wasn’t normal, I wonder if in part we’re just more open now to seeing and treating problems that were perhaps always there in teenagers, and that’s a good thing. (An estimated one in 10 children now have clinically diagnosable mental health disorders, but that’s the same rate as in 1999.) The sharp rise in mental health referrals by schools suggests they’re spotting problems earlier, although unfortunately the services to which these kids are referred are stretched to breaking point.The new courses have a greater emphasis on final exam marks, with little or no coursework counting towards final grades, and a new grading scheme running from 9 at the top to 1 as the lowest rank.The new system sets a 4 as equivalent to a C under the previous rankings, while the top grades A* and A will be split into three grades, 7, 8 and 9 – with 9 awarded to those with marks at the top of the old A* grade.Ofqual’s chief regulator said the new courses allowed students to more fully display their abilities and knowledge, and would help them go on to further study. “In turn, the new 9 to 1 grade system signals to employers and others that this year’s students have studied new, more challenging content, and better differentiates between their achievements,” she said.“Putting more emphasis on final exams is hitting hardest those who require the most support, such as disadvantaged students and students with special education need,” said Kevin Courtney, the union’s general secretary.We’re probably also more alert to those teenagers who wouldn’t necessarily reach a diagnostic threshold but are still significantly unhappier than anyone wants a child to be: anxious, fragile, struggling to cope. These kids may need professional help managing their feelings, but we should also be asking why so many of them are suddenly having such feelings.While the young people we should be most worried about are the ones struggling even to leave their rooms, rather than the ones queuing up to walk the comfort dog, even the latter may be more stressed than a 20-year-old should be, or even used to be, and they’re telling us something about the world we as adults have created for them.What could we do differently? For a start, parents need to beware projecting their own anxieties on to kids who aren’t mature enough to handle them. Social media companies could stop kicking and squealing every time someone suggests limiting children’s access to their addictive, feel-bad platforms, which only intensify teenagers’ emotional ups and downs. Child and adolescent mental health services must be properly funded to meet rising demand, and backed up by pastoral measures in schools and universities to build emotional resilience – which includes learning to bounce back from life’s inevitable setbacks.Governments of all colours, meanwhile, have to learn to stop fiddling pointlessly with exams. No more tearing up syllabuses, marking schemes or grade boundaries for the sake of a headline give teachers time to absorb one set of changes before leaping into the next and focus instead on building an economy where getting a decent job doesn’t feel like a game of musical chairs in which too many chairs are snatched away. That’s a far harder test for politicians, obviously. Some might even call it a “gold standard”. But we are heaping too much pressure on small shoulders. It’s time adults started to lighten the load."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ead0ea54c143e5cbe920a3ba82e051ea087d157/0_161_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49ba60c1fbbd99a908049fb6c050195","title":"middle aged women invisible on screen campaign acting casting","story":"Like most of us I love a good TV drama, which is why I sat down to watch both The City and the City and Deep State recently. But this time irritation spoiled my enjoyment. The lead actors of both British series, in their middle 50s, were cast against female lead actors as romantic partners, both in their 30s.Once you see this, it’s hard to unsee it. So I reflected on other forms of entertainment. Saturday-night TV gave me a range of shows with men in middle age, and older and female co-presenters who weren’t, or who certainly looked like they weren’t, much older than 35. Or take film: I love to watch Tom Cruise, but the really impossible mission seems to be to star with a female actor his own age. The latest Mission Impossible film sees the 55-year-old paired with 34-year-old Rebecca Ferguson, which sends a message to me that men in middle age are still capable and vibrant, energetic and passionate, whereas middle-aged women are redundant.In a sample of 12 cinema releases this month, there are nine lead actresses in the 19-to-30 age range, but only three films with female leads over the age of 40. Their male co-stars aren’t bound by this formula. Why is it that our middle-aged male screen heroes seem unable to contemplate a relationship with a woman of their own age?I’m 51 and my husband is 49. All our friends are similar ages and with similarly aged partners. But in the world of TV, middle-aged women like me are often absent. On TV, if you’re a woman every year over 40 seems to count for five years.Two years ago, I set myself a challenge: to relaunch my acting career, which I’d shelved very early on for my parental and filial caring responsibilities, looking after two daughters with disabilities and a mother diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Two decades on, I had no idea how difficult this second attempt as a performer would prove to be, but in an industry dominated by youth – and where old for women is 35 – the ageism is shockingly blatant.So today, with the recent words of the actor Frances McDormand about the inclusivity rider on film contracts featuring prominently in my thoughts, I am launching a new campaign: Acting Your Age . I’m calling on writers, commissioners, directors and performers to embrace a generation of invisible women.I don’t want the wonderful Sarah Lancashire, star of Happy Valley, to be the only exception to a British rule – or for the age-appropriate casting of Olivia Colman in The Crown to be a rarity. I don’t want Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman to have to fight tooth and nail to get a series such as Big Little Lies made. I want these to be the normal way of things for middle-aged women, just as they are for middle-aged men.Of course, the marginalisation of middle-aged women is not limited to acting – as the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Ben Broadbent, showed this week when he referred to a “menopausal economy”, older women are portrayed negatively in all walks of life. But perhaps if we achieved visibility on the influencers that are TV and film, we might be deemed to exist across the board. Isn’t it time to end the notion that the advent of a woman’s wrinkles and grey hair means she can no longer pay her mortgage through acting?• Nicola Clark is a writer, campaigner and performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e01f051ba84f762c4fd096f796205944858b49/1368_1239_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4216b910d27241db1de4c31a6f3b7795","title":"what wore week pinafore dress jess cartner morley","story":"Feel weird in dungarees?

When your desire to wear an item of clothing is driven by wanting to look the way one specific person looks in that item of clothing – and that one specific person looks nothing like you – stop right there. Take a step back from the checkout. Close down the online shopping tab. It just doesn’t work.You see, in an ideal world I would look like Jane\u0026nbspBirkin in blue jeans and a white T-shirt. But I\u0026nbspdon’t look anything like Jane Birkin, and not even the perfect jeans nor the ultimate T-shirt will change that. Same goes for looking like Naomi Campbell in a bikini. The best swimwear in the world will get me precisely nowhere on that front. See?Anyway, I have this thing with dungarees. In the aforementioned ideal world, I would look like Alexa Chung in dungarees. With, like, a\u0026nbspmessy bob and cool trainers. So into that look. But I don’t look like Alexa Chung, and therefore I won’t look like Alexa Chung in dungarees, I\u0026nbspwill look like me in dungarees, which is less style-icon-playing-down-her-intimidating-beauty-in-utilitarian-workwear than fashion-editor-dressed-as-children’s-TV-presenter.

Pinafore dresses have the breezy, nonchalant aesthetic that I like about dungarees minus the vaguely comic crotch area and the terrifying back view.However, even at my high level of enthusiasm, I\u0026nbspdon’t think the pinafore is a piece you are going to want to buy several of, so I suggest you look for one in a more grownup fabric than denim, and then you can wear it to work as well as at the weekend, without looking like you belong on the railroad. You want something weighty, so it doesn’t crease badly when you sit. Crepe or wool, maybe, or I am really rather taken with the Kitri dress I am wearing here.

It’s an unhurried, elegiac address to the idea of childhood and your home town – and how returning to both has a bittersweet savour. As in his previous film, Winter Sleep, he draws on the spirit of Chekhov. But his style is all his own: not Chekhovian, but Ceylanian. There are scenes in which people placidly watch TV: largely histrionic soaps whose contrast to the film itself is a type of comedy the director playfully allows us to notice.

Has he misread their humility and acceptance and miscalculated the price he will have to pay for his yearned-for differentness from them, and for all that glamorous big-city success? The graduate is Sinan (Aydın Doğu Demirkol), who has come back with ambiguous feelings about the place where he grew up. As for so many writers, his home looks wonderful when he is away from it, when it is tamed and transformed by his imagination. But actually being there reminds him of all its irritations and absurdities. Sinan is from a village near the port of Çanakkale, a tourist destination on account of being near the site of the first world war Gallipoli campaign, and also the ancient city of Troy. We see Sinan at one stage trudging past a huge statue of the Trojan horse, built for the Brad Pitt movie Troy and now reverently maintained in the city.Sinan knows he cannot afford to despise bumpkins, because his literary debut is going to be a work about this very homeland. It’s an autobiographical essay memoir about the local landscape, entitled The Wild Pear Tree, concerning that rough beautiful terrain where these trees grow. Later, Sinan’s scapegrace dad will say that all the people around those parts are like wild pears: “Misfits, solitary, misshapen.” Ceylan saves this line for near the end, perhaps reluctant to make the title’s metaphorical function too obvious. His father is Idris, tremendously played by Murat Cemcir, a man whose youthful charm and romanticism has curdled with age into a pre-emptive bluster and cajoling. He is a gambling addict who has borrowed money all over town his addiction has kept his family on the poverty line. Only by confiscating his debit card and grabbing his pay packet the moment it arrives has his wife kept the household afloat. But Idris owns a tiny bit of land near the house, and he has got it into his head that there is a water source there, so he spends every weekend digging a well, hoping for the water to come trickling in. Sinan senses that this tough quest is not unlike a writer’s life. There is a quietly hilarious sequence when we watch Idris, Sinan and Idris’s own exasperated father trying to winch a boulder out of this deep pit.Warily, Sinan touches base with everyone in the village: apart from everything else, he needs loans or donations to publish his book himself. His mum’s elderly father is a retired imam who is used, and rather exploited, by the conceited young incumbent as an unpaid replacement for various duties. He sees some of his old friends. Most importantly, he sees Hatice (Hazar Ergüçlü), a beautiful young woman who he was once in love with, and probably still is.There are some stunning images in the film: particularly the vision of a baby covered in ants, which is to be developed into that of an adult covered in ants. There are great scenes it is in some sense a short-story anthology of such scenes. His encounter with Hatice is breathtakingly good: the mood shifts and tones are superbly managed. She teases him about his grumpiness he goads her about what looks like an imminent submission to marriage. He thought she was still together with a rival of his, but this is wrong. Their tensely murmured conversation has a fascinatingly erotic conclusion. I was a little sad that this gripping relationship disappears from the film, except in a later scene in which Hatice is the reason for a punch-up between her ex-boyfriend Riza (Ahmet Rifat Sungar) and Sinan, who appears to have been unable to resist boasting about this earlier encounter.There is another glorious scene in which the bumptious Sinan notices a famous writer Süleyman (Serkan Keskin) in a Çanakkale bookshop and presumes to go up and ask for advice. Cautiously, Süleyman agrees but is then dismayed by the ungrateful way Sinan doesn’t seem to accept or listen to what he has to say, and reveals that he only wants to needle Süleyman about all the petty vanities and hypocrisies of the literary establishment. Irritated beyond endurance, Süleyman finally screams at him to go away – and the audience can see exactly how he feels.But we have to sympathise with Sinan in another beguilingly comic scene in which the young man, having failed to get public money to help with publishing costs from the mayor, goes to see a local builder because the man is supposed to be a great reader and reputedly helps with projects like this. When Sinan gets there, he realises the awful truth. This builder doesn’t care at all for being a sponsor of literature – he simply bought a few books of local history because he wanted lucrative government contracts from the mayor. The excruciating disappointment and strained politeness of this scene are a joy.And all the time the question of life, and the gamble on life that we are required to make in our early 20s, runs under the movie’s meandering path. It is another deeply satisfying, intelligent piece of film-making from Ceylan. The indulgent Idris tells his son that he often has a wild pear for breakfast and it is delicious. This film is, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65395bfd1bb5849346baf1c74b52c01d97033622/0_0_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3876647acade4e0a5b99c784278c8e","title":"antonio conte chelsea winner lost mojo fa cup final","story":"Antonio Conte, clean‑shaven on the eve of the FA Cup final, digested the question, took a deep breath and then conjured a fresh analogy for an increasingly weary theme. “Last season was a wonderful season because we reached an important success,” the Chelsea head coach said, his mind retreating exactly 12 months to the raucous celebrations with the Premier League trophy on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. “But then you have to understand the way you won. If your car is going at 300km per hour, or if you are winning while going at normal velocity and aren’t risking burning out your engine.”The question, asked before the resumption of hostilities with José Mourinho and Manchester United, had been about whether defeat by Arsenal in last year’s Cup final had, in hindsight, provided glimpses of the unravelling which would follow. Whether Diego Costa’s post-match insistence that he would not be forced to China but would hold out for Atlético Madrid, or that glimpse of a team who had taken their eyes off the ball, were a portent of everything unsettling to come. It said much that Conte’s response, impressively inventive in his second language, was effectively a return to a default position.His sense of dissatisfaction at recruitment policy and perception that the board failed to build on last season’s success infected Chelsea through the second half of his tenure. The drip feed of negativity has lowered the collective mood. At times it is as if he has been goading Roman Abramovich, a notoriously trigger-happy owner. Quite possibly it was only the unpalatable prospect of a hefty compensation payout that stayed the owner’s hand, particularly after humiliations against Bournemouth and Watford. As it is he would have to fork out £9m to dispense with Conte’s services but there is a sense that the orce is imminent.Chelsea are used to chopping and changing. Theirs has been a boom-and-bust approach under Abramovich, and it has still yielded a trophy haul the envy of virtually every club in the country. Those on the inside accept they can be the victims of the kind of emotive, forthright manager they tend to appoint, though Carlo Ancelotti and others might argue it is a tolerance of relative failure that has been lacking.What the board has to contemplate is whether it would be to Chelsea’s benefit to dispense with an elite coach who has claimed major reward at every club he has overseen since 2010 – a promotion with Siena, three Serie A titles at Juventus and, after two years with Italy, last season’s Premier League – transforming a side who had finished 10th into title winners with only three key additions. Can a club condemned to the Europa League attract a candidate of similar status? Probably. Is there scope financially to lure a Luis Enrique or Leonardo Jardim, Maurizio Sarri or Massimiliano Allegri, plus their respective entourages, while also meting out compensation? Maybe, at a push. It might be worth the cost just to be rid of the whingeing.Conte’s constant sniping infuriated Juventus’ hierarchy eventually, for all the club’s dominance in Serie A, though the head coach had a point this time. Adding Álvaro Morata, Tiémoué Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater, Antonio Rüdiger, Davide Zappacosta and Willy Caballero to ranks depleted by the departures of Nathan Aké, John Terry, Asmir Begovic, Nathaniel Chalobah, Nemanja Matic and Costa hardly constituted bolstering options before a title defence and Champions League campaign. An opportunity was passed up once Chelsea balked at Mino Raiola’s fee to restore Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge, or Juve’s £80m asking price for Alex Sandro.There had been fears of a parting even in the immediate aftermath of the title win. Relations became so strained over the summer that Conte’s backroom staff, who had mainly been living in short-term lets, moved into a local hotel while they waited to discover if they would be retained. An uneasy truce was secured, with a new contract on improved, if not extended, terms papering over the cracks.Even the midwinter additions of Ross Barkley, Emerson and Olivier Giroud did not serve to appease. “I’m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players,” Conte said through a rueful smile in February. “I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.” That was an interesting message to send to the new arrivals, the recruitment department and the director Marina Granovskaia, who had assumed Michael Emenalo’s duties.Then there was the regular damning of Chelsea with praise for Manchester City, whose emergence under Pep Guardiola, secured until 2021, threatens to block any short-term route to recovery. “They are a club that want to invest and improve,” he said last month. “They did a great job on and off the pitch they were very well prepared for the season.”That unsettling sniping is unlikely to stop. If Granovskaia, with whom the Italian’s relationship is understood to have been particularly frosty at times, can secure someone more amenable to working within the relative financial constraints of Chelsea 2018 rather than Chelsea circa 2004 – Jardim perhaps – there would be fewer headaches all round. Thoughts drift back to the infamous text exchange between Conte and Costa. It was no secret the Italian hoped to be rid of the high-maintenance striker but those upstairs had not sanctioned him to communicate it so bluntly. It was as if he did not entirely trust the board to push through the sale, so forced the matter himself.The schism with Costa did not impress the players. Back in those celebratory scenes a year ago, there was a unity between staff and squad. The endless high-octane training had driven Chelsea, against the odds, to the title. This time round there is a sense of grumbling disquiet. The gruelling sessions left the team 30 points off City. In finishing 10th in 2016, Chelsea had been 31 points from the summit.Many were baffled by the six changes made against Huddersfield this month just as a semblance of momentum was building in the pursuit of the top four. David Luiz has hardly featured since questioning the management after a humiliation at Roma. Eden Hazard has not enjoyed his guest appearances as a false No 9. Willian, who has started once since a stroppy substitution in the Cup semi-final, was asked about his relationship with Conte by ESPN Brazil this week. “Oh boy, do you really want me to tell you?” he replied. “Well, let’s save it for our next interview.” Chelsea will be far more reluctant to lose Hazard or Willian than Conte."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e834ddfcf276c5a88110c761b6e1afa60efbb2/19_136_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37055a92981ef1850d3358a9594a561d","title":"rare whisky vintage scotch auction","story":"Vintage Scotch dubbed ‘holy grail of Macallan’ auctioned in Hong KongA bottle of single malt whisky has been sold for a record $1.1m (£815,760) at an auction in Hong Kong.The very rare 1926 Macallan scotch whisky was sold an hour after a bottle of the same vintage also changed hands for a slightly smaller seven-figure sum. The whisky bottles, which had not been seen in public since they were last auctioned three decades ago, are described as the “holy grail of Macallan” because only 24 bottles were produced as gifts for the distillery’s most-valued customers. The bottles feature specially commissioned labels by the pop artists Valerio Adami, which sold for $1.1m (£814,000), and Sir Peter Blake, which sold for just over $1m. The Blake-designed bottle sold to a telephone bidder and the Adami-designed bottle was sold to a bidder in the room at Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong. The record sale price works out at £1,080 per millilitre of whisky. Both bidders were undisclosed.The previous whisky sale price record was set in 2017 with the £730,000 sale of a six-bottle lot of Macallan. The previous record for a single bottle was the £466,000 paid for a Macallan M Imperiale in 2014, although an Imperiale contains eight and a half 70cl bottles worth of whisky. Daniel Lam, Bonhams’ head of fine wine and whisky in Hong Kong, said: “These two bottles are the most significant whiskies ever produced in 20th century and truly presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity for collectors to acquire the holy grail of Macallan.“Active bidding came in from around the world but we saw new bidders from South-east Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, reflecting the growing appetite and appreciation for whisky among Asian collectors.”The whisky, which was bottled in 1986, is presented in specially commissioned cabinets or Tantaluses, based on the traditional ‘brass and glass’ distillery spirit safe. Blake is best known for co-creating the Beatles’ album cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club band in 1967, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine as the No 1 album of all time. Adami is an Italian artist famous for painting bold, flat forms outlined in thick, black lines, in a style reminiscent of comic art.

May’s other nominees are Diana Barran, Catherine Meyer, the founder of Action Against Abduction who is married to former US ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer, and Amanda Sater, a former party deputy chair.The nominations will tilt the balance of the chamber slightly in favour of May, taking her party’s total of peers from 244 to 253. But no party has a majority in the 780-strong upper house, and the government has been so heavily defeated on some amendments that introducing a handful of more supportive peers will only make a modest difference in getting Brexit through parliament.The DUP will nominate the former MP William McCrea, who has been criticised for sharing a platform in the past with Billy Wright, a loyalist paramilitary. Only McCrea’s name emerged, despite rumours that the DUP was initially offered at least one other nomination.Labour was granted three nominations, and Jeremy Corbyn put forward the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and the race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, the mother of the MP Kate Osamor, as had been expected. The third nominee is Pauline Bryan, a Scottish campaigner and editor of What Would Keir Hardie Say?, a collection of essays once given by Corbyn to Barack Obama.The proposed elevation of Osamor was immediately criticised by a Jewish campaign group after it emerged that she was one of several signatories to a 2016 letter complaining about the suspension of Ken Livingstone and others over antisemitism. Arguing that the suspensions were McCarthyite, the letter said the charges of antisemitism were being used to “silence criticisms of Israel … and undermine Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”.Gideon Falter, the chair of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said that elevating Osamor was a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, and that Corbyn’s decision was “telling us not only that he sees her behaviour as unproblematic, but that he sees it as being worthy of the highest honour and a lifelong seat in the House of Lords”.Political peers are nominated periodically at the initiation of Downing Street in a behind-the-scenes haggling process, which in this case began in November, and starts with a debate about how many each party is granted. Names are suggested informally and canvassed before the House of Lords appointments commission to see if they meet the appropriate financial and legal standards before finally being formally submitted.The Liberal Democrats did not make any nominations, although it is well represented in the chamber with 98 peers. Dick Newby, the party’s leader in the Lords, said: “This is a cynical response from Theresa May to losing a string of votes in the Lords in recent weeks.”Lilley, a Thatcherite who has long been a Eurosceptic, was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary and then social security secretary in John Major’s government. At the 1992 party conference he sang about his “little list” of benefit fraudsters and was an energetic promoter of the idea that many people on social security were scroungers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0983f3f3bdfd0334154d8c41fc1f2333f9da823/0_0_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822aaf2b14e96304582572ace29afe4a","title":"theresa may john bercow andrea leadsom alleged stupid woman remarks unacceptable","story":"Theresa May’s spokesman says ‘unacceptable’ comment must be looked at if complaint madeTheresa May has said there should be an investigation if a complaint is made over allegations that John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, called Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman” in heated exchanges after prime minister’s questions.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “We’ve seen the alleged remarks and clearly the prime minister thinks they are unacceptable. And if an official complaint is made, it should be properly investigated.”But MPs have said the Commons system of investigation is too flawed to do an effective job. Although any complaint can trigger an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, her report has to be submitted to the committee on standards.On Tuesday, MPs on the committee blocked an inquiry into historical allegations of bullying by Bercow by three votes to two. The committee is unique because it has lay members, but they do not have a vote. It is understood these members unanimously supported an investigation. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has been spearheading work to improve the system for reporting and investigating complaints. She is said to believe the committee’s decision underlines the need to revoke MPs’ power to decide on sanctions.In the Commons on Wednesday, Bercow was overheard swearing under his breath after he criticised Leadsom for arranging government statements that took up time intended for a Labour debate on Grenfell. An opposition MP told Leadsom what they had heard. She is understood not to want to raise a complaint personally and so far no one has lodged a complaint with the standards commissioner. If a complaint were lodged, it is thought this could allow Stone to investigate the historical allegations of bullying, despite the committee’s move to block it.The Speaker’s office did not deny that Bercow made the remark. “Strong and differing views” had been expressed in the chamber on an “unusual and controversial day”, it said, adding: “The Speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons.”The historical allegations of bullying were made earlier this year in a BBC Newsnight investigation. They involved two senior members of Commons staff, who had each been Bercow’s private secretary after he was elected Speaker.Kate Emms allegedly developed post-traumatic stress disorder after working for him, and Angus Sinclair took compulsory early retirement. He said Bercow had demeaned and physically intimidated him, once smashing a mobile phone on his desk. Later, another former senior parliamentary figure, David Leakey, criticised Bercow. Bercow has emphatically denied allegations that he bullied Sinclair and Emms.The allegations emerged after Leadsom had finished her inquiry into overhauling the complaints system in the Commons. She has made no secret of the fact that she wanted the committee set up to investigate complaints to be given the power to examine recent allegations about past incidents.Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who was on the committee and is part of the steering group overseeing reform, said: “If there isn’t urgent reform to the standards committee there will be a massive outcry.“For as long as MPs are both judge and jury we are never going to have a fair and independent complaints system – it urgently needs to change so there is a proper way to deal with allegations of this nature. otherwise we are letting down Commons staff and ending up with trial by media which risks wronging everyone.” Bercow, a former Conservative MP, has had an increasingly stormy relationship with MPs and ministers, mainly those on the Tory side of the house, since he was elected in 2009.James Duddridge, one of his most outspoken critics, challenged Labour MPs over their support for Bercow. “Labour can’t pretend to be a decent party that cares about issues of sexism and bullying and procedure while supporting him, even if he is a pain for the government and helpful to them,” he said. “There’s a bigger picture here. He’s normalising bullying.”Bercow’s detractors feel he is immune to criticism because of the unique authority of his office. The Speaker is the champion of backbenchers, and of the principle of government accountability to the Commons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/426372472b14a4edaf6fded898c687ba30b56d52/124_951_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd7b74e66e2ea65b28f7dc1e63b7c705","title":"neuroscientist hannah critchlow cambridge consciousness funny word","story":"On any given day in Cambridge, you may see numerous people jogging along the towpaths, and it’s not unreasonable to assume neuroscientists may be over-represented. “You see so many,” says Hannah Critchlow, a neuroscientist who likes to jog along the river. Physical fitness may be a secondary consideration, she says what they are really trying to do is ramp up their neurogenesis – the birth of new nerve cells in the brain.We are sitting in her study at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Critchlow is outreach fellow, tasked with public engagement. Once described by the  as “a sort of female Brian Cox”, she has given numerous talks, been a presenter on Tomorrow’s World Live, the interactive version of the BBC science show, appeared on TV, radio and podcasts and was named as a top 100 scientist for her work in science communication. She has just written a book on consciousness – part of the Ladybird Expert series aimed at adults, a brief but mindbending introduction to the brain and the idea of consciousness, taking in philosophy, famous neuroscience breakthroughs and brain facts.“Our brain contains around 86bn nerve cells,” she writes. “To scale it down to something more palatable, if we took a dot of brain tissue the size of a sugar grain, it would contain roughly 10,000 nerve cells. Even more incredible: each of these nerve cells connects to around 10,000 others, forming the most densely packed and complicated circuit board imaginable.”She also writes about smart drugs, such as those prescribed for ADHD, that increase focus (she has said in the past that they are a problem among both students and academic staff). Does she still think that? Yes, she says. “First of all, people are buying these over the internet so they have no idea what they’re actually getting. And they’re taking them at doses that aren’t maybe optimum for that person’s chemistry. We don’t know what the long-term effects are, particularly on the developing brain. The brain is undergoing a huge amount of plasticity until the mid-20s, so I think it’s a terrible idea to take any kind of mind-altering drug until you’ve passed your mid-20s. I think it’s a really worrying issue and a potential timebomb.”She has started writing another book, based around the idea of free will. “There’s quite a lot of evidence to show it’s largely an illusion,” she says. “There’s a huge amount that seems to be hardwired into us and predetermined. You are born with a particular brain and that shapes your perception, shapes what you are hardwired to find rewarding. You are brought up in a particular environment and that reinforces what you are born with.” What does that mean for decision-making? “If your perception of the world is based on prior experiences and hardwiring, then that shapes your reality, which goes on to affect your decision-making. A large amount of your decision-making taps into your reward system in your brain. Although there is scope to change certain behaviours, you have to make a real conscious effort in order to break habits and change how your reward system affects your motivation. I think neuroscience can be very empowering in that, in making me go for a jog rather than reach for a bottle of shiraz.”Surely there is a danger in being a neuroscientist, running injuries aside, that you can start to view people as simply a bunch of chemical and electrical reactions. “I haven’t got to that point, yet,” says Critchlow. “I hope I never do.” But isn’t that what neuroscience is basically saying we are? “Yeah, but it’s an awe-inspiring, highly sophisticated, highly dynamic system that is incredible and beautiful in its intricacy. There are some gorgeous videos of new connections taking place in living, moving mammals as they’re moving around, going around a maze, for example. It’s incredible that our brain, as we are navigating the space around us – or in this case, the mouse – changes shape. You can see consciousness happen, new connections forming.”Demystifying the brain’s connections doesn’t reduce its magic, she says. “We each have such unique takes on the world. And then – and this is where I think it gets really interesting – our brains have these flaws, which means we make assumptions or we get things a little bit wrong, so our reality is not quite right. If we then discuss reality with another person who has another perspective, then we’re more likely to get a common understanding and appreciation of the world and it will become closer to reality.” But aren’t we living in polarised times, where nuance is out and it is impossible to find common ground with someone who believes the exact opposite? She thinks that ideas sharing through social-media technology is in its “toddler-tantrum” infancy and hopes we will be able to “exchange ideas in a more positive way”.“Hopefully the educational system will catch up and help people to evaluate whether they trust a particular source or not. That’s a skill that needs to be fostered from a young age.”The thing Critchlow most remembers about science lessons at school was being sent out of class for talking. She thought she might want to study medicine, but while working as a nursing assistant at a psychiatric hospital, she became fascinated by how the brain worked. “The medication and therapies on offer weren’t really doing anything other than making a lot of the patients almost catatonic. People would lose their cognitive capacity and potential to have joy from life.”After a degree in biology at Brunel University, she studied for a PhD at Cambridge. Her experience informs her work now as outreach fellow – she goes to state secondary schools and colleges to give talks about neuroscience, but also about the possibility of higher education and the Oxbridge admissions process. For state school intake, Cambridge is ranked fifth worst (Oxford is fourth). While Critchlow can’t talk about the prejudice that may lurk within the admissions system, she says perception from students is one problem. “I went to a state school and when I was thinking of applying to university, there was no chance that I’d have thought about applying to Cambridge. I came here for my PhD but that was because, at that point, I’d gained enough confidence. It’s maybe the perception of Oxford and Cambridge being elite universities and maybe students not having the confidence to apply, or not knowing much about the application process.”Is sexism a problem? When she was working on her PhD, a decade or so ago, she was giving a talk and one of the professors told her he couldn’t concentrate because when she was pointing to the data, her top was riding up slightly, exposing a “really small amount of my midriff. Apparently it was too distracting and he couldn’t concentrate on any of my data. I was pretty pissed off about that. You don’t imagine a male student gets those kind of comments.” People are much more aware now, she says. “I think there is still a bit of bias, but it’s been acknowledged.”It’s a particularly fascinating time to be a neuroscientist, she says, because society is having discussions about consciousness, artificial intelligence and what it means to be human. The question of consciousness has plagued neuroscientists and philosophers for centuries. What is Critchlow’s definition? “I think consciousness is a really funny word, and as we learn more about how the brain works, I think it is going to become even more difficult to give a succinct definition. Generally speaking, it has been agreed that consciousness is the ability to form a subjective view of the world, to have a unique view.”She says that in the future, we will probably be appalled at the way we treat animals now as we learn more about their brains and consciousness, but she’s also interested in the idea plants can be “conscious”. In her book, she writes about plants using electrical signals to send information around their “bodies”, and responding to their environments. She gives the example of a caterpillar eating a leaf: “The plant will start to produce a chemical to repel the insect. Even if the plant is simply played an audio file of a munching caterpillar, it will respond, indicating that plants can hear.”“So what do we eat?” says Critchlow. “Where do we draw a line? It’s starting to force us into this position where we have to ask ourselves maybe we don’t have this sovereignty over nature that we’ve always led ourselves to believe.”Can AI be considered to be conscious? “As we discover more about the neural networks and connections in the brain that allow us to learn and remember and form a subjective view of the world, we are starting to be able to use that information and emulate it in artificial intelligence systems. They can learn and remember without being coded to process information in the way we have told them to. So using that definition, yes, we’ll be able to develop AI that has some semblance of consciousness. But it’s a funny word. It’s almost as if humans have developed this word to make ourselves seem more important than we are.”Should robots have rights? She thinks for a while. “I’m not sure what the point would be. I think it’s going to be interesting to see how it all develops, to see the implications as AI evolves, what kind of rights should they have and what kind of limits should they have. I don’t think there’s a set answer. We don’t have a full handle on AI.”She caused a bit of a stir at the Hay festival in 2015 when she said it would be possible to download someone’s brain on to a computer – it seems less remarkable now that there are companies working on this, although in the face of much scepticism from the neuroscience community. “It’s a possibility, but I think there are a lot of things that are possibilities,” she says. “There are scientists that are working on taking a snapshot of the connectome, the 100tn or so connections in the brain, mapping those connections on a computer. So does that mean you can upload your brain if you have a snapshot of it at one particular time? Or if we have enough information could you then run simulations to see how the brain would evolve? We probably will get there at some point in the future.”Critchlow says she’s not keen on the idea for herself, although she is planning to donate her body to scientific research. “I don’t think it would be me. A simulation of me. This would just be a copy of me, of my connections.” Besides, she says, she thinks her simulation might still miss tangible, physical pleasures that come from being attached to a body. Such as gnocchi. It makes me laugh because it’s so specific, and not what I was expecting her to say – wine, perhaps, or running. But it’s lunchtime and she’s hungry (and she really loves gnocchi).

The top of Christopher Wren’s tallest spire came crashing down - losing the top 2.5 metres (8 ft) of its total 71-metre (234 ft) height.George III, who had an interest in scientific matters, wrote to Benjamin Franklin in America for advice. Franklin, a decade earlier, had invented the lightning conductor after working out that lightning was electricity. The King was advised that a metal rod fastened to the highest point of St Bride’s spire and attached to a thick band of metal would lead the electric charge from any future strikes safely to the ground without harming the building. But there was a dispute between the two men that became a political issue. Franklin favoured a pointed lightning conductor and the King, with advice from the Royal Society, thought a blunt tip would be best. In fact he ordered a cannon ball to top all conductors used anywhere in the British Empire. For the next 250 years American conductors were pointed and British ones blunt until experiments this century finally proved that blunt versions were better at attracting lightning.

Coincidentally, 1998 was also the year the iconic Angel of the North sculpture, designed by Antony Gormley, was erected in Gateshead. Both were towering achievements but, for a long time, just one of them seemed to have been built to last.Only now are Newcastle Falcons beginning to stretch their muscular arms once again, guided by a man who has had an even more tumultuous couple of decades. As it happens Dean Richards also made his first foray into management with Leicester in 1998, taking over from Bob Dwyer, and subsequently leading them to four Premiership titles and two European Cups in four seasons. Dragging Newcastle up from the league’s nether regions on a modest budget has, in its own way, been equally impressive.The north-east will love him even more if the Falcons can beat Exeter at Sandy Park on Saturday and bring some northern soul to the Twickenham grand final next week. It will be a tall order but Richards, freshly crowned as the Premiership’s director of rugby of the season for the first time in 17 years, has never been a guru who believes in the obvious.“There’s a joke going round that if you ever see Dean out on the field in his tracksuit with a whistle in his mouth take a photo because it’ll be worth an absolute fortune,” says the\u0026nbspFalcons’ managing director, Mick\u0026nbspHogan. “In terms of rarity value it’s probably as priceless as a\u0026nbspVan\u0026nbspGogh.”More commonplace, according to\u0026nbspHogan, is the sight of the 54‑year‑old former England No\u0026nbsp8 bobbing around in the North Sea rather than poring over match DVDs on his days off. “You’ll find him out at sea on his boat fishing. You’d think it must be a bloody strong boat, maybe some sort of decommissioned minesweeper, but\u0026nbspapparently it’s a tiny little wooden thing. He loves the\u0026nbspoutdoor\u0026nbsplife and you get that in the north-east.”In the same breath, though, Hogan will tell you why Richards has been pivotal to Newcastle’s steady rise since the club signed him in 2012 while he was still in the final months of a three-year ban following the infamous Bloodgate scandal. If moving to the north-east has helped to restore his reputation, he has done the same for the Falcons.“He is absolutely central to it all,” says Hogan. “To me there are two areas where he’s particularly good. Number one: he’s the best recruiter in the game. It’s not just about finding unknowns or signing Niki Goneva ... he gets it right at both ends of the spectrum.“We plucked Tane Takulua from absolutely nowhere and I’d put him up there with any scrum-half in the league now. The other bit he gets is the importance of the academy. It’s very easy for the guy at the top to look week to week because they’re judged on results. Not many are looking at the 16- or 17-year-olds and wondering: ‘Are they going to come good in five years’ time?’ Dean does.”Players of all vintages also relish his occasionally left-field methods. The former England captain Martin Corry, for example, still remembers the instant effect Richards had in his initial months at Leicester. “The transformation was remarkable. He felt the steeliness had gone out of the pack so he and John Wells announced they were going to start mauling against us at training. He always won.”Then there were the off-field bonding initiatives. “When he first took over at Leicester he realised the spirit wasn’t what it should have been,” says Corry.“He got us all in to a function room and said: ‘Tell your wives and girlfriends you’re going to be here for two hours.’ He then paired up one back and one forward for a three-legged race around every bar in Welford Road, with the first pair back the winner. I think there were 16 bars and you had to have a drink in each of them.”Some old-school habits have endured. Newcastle’s Scotland back-rower Ally Hogg, now in his last days before retirement, has spent eight years with the Falcons and recalls the club’s first big away win in Bristol under Richards after being relegated to the Championship. “We\u0026nbspbeat them down there and within five minutes we’d stopped at an off-licence and Dean was in buying beers for all the boys for the bus trip home. That was his thing: you had to make sure you bought your opposite number a pint after the game and on every away trip you’d have a few beers to bring everyone together. He has that old‑school mentality, which I think is key to building a good culture.”According to Corry, that could just be Richards’s most enduring quality. “What makes Deano great is that he’s adaptable. You’d never think he would move with the times, that he’d be the same old Deano, but he’s always managed to stay on top of the game. Look at how he’s come back from what happened at Harlequins. What he’s done at Newcastle is probably more impressive than what he did at Leicester. Yes there are plenty of anecdotes about him, but I think what he’s doing transcends that. You want to play for Dean, the club and your mates. It’s not just painting by numbers.”If signing good players and persuading them to perform above their natural ability was easy, everyone would be doing it. The coaching input of Dave Walder, Micky Ward and Scott MacLeod should not be underestimated but Hogg also salutes Richards’s squad‑building acumen. “He picks players based on what he thinks the squad needs, whether it be a big unit to truck it up the middle or someone with a bit more deft skill. Sometimes it’s not always about the best players, it’s about combinations and how they complement each other.”Should the Falcons upset Exeter it will be no surprise to anyone within Richards’s inner circle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb255413e1a93c6c725879fe83eadadfd1a89db/202_397_2862_1717/master/2862.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e222b7952983539a707679bd23fcdd0","title":"rafael nadal fabio fognini italian open maria sharapova jelena ostapenko","story":"It seems odd that Rafael Nadal’s domination on clay in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Paris has not been so evident in Rome, where he has a mere seven titles and last appeared in the semi-finals four years ago. Still, he will hardly complain and he will be mightily happy if he wins on Sunday as it will haul him back to No\u0026nbsp1 in the world above the absent Roger\u0026nbspFederer.The man he defeated 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semi‑finals, Fabio Fognini, will afford the Spaniard little sympathy if he falls short. This was Fognini’s first quarter-final at his home tournament at the 13th attempt and he must have thought he could go further, or even all the way, when he came from 4-1 down in the first set to send Roman tennis fans into a frenzy on a perfect summer’s day.Last year Fognini defeated Andy Murray before the eventual champion, Alexander Zverev, put him out in the third round. But, at 30 and happily married to the retired 2015 US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta, he seems to have drained his game of the maddening inconsistencies that did for him so often in the past. Here it was Nadal’s forehand and a failing knee that stopped his bid.At 15-30 and 4-4 Nadal went behind for the first time after 53 minutes. Fognini, who had sprayed a dozen unforced errors around the Campo Centrale, was energised. He needed to hold serve to take only his 11th set off Nadal in 14 matches – and he did it right on the hour with a rasping forehand.The only man in tennis who puts his towel between his teeth had the bit there now but he knew retaliation would be swift. Nadal, roused from his slumber, opened up another 4-1 lead and this time levelled at a set apiece.Shaken by the counterattack Fognini resisted as best he could. This was an adagio, slow and drawn out, rather than the crescendo that Johanna Konta had referred to the previous day, describing that urge to finish a match in a rush. Fognini, limping, shoved a weary backhand wide and it was over after two and a quarter hours.“I made a couple of mistakes in the first set,” Nadal said. “I should not lose two serves in a row but he was taking the ball earlier than me and was able to control points from the baseline. Then I played a little more aggressive on my forehand.”It was the first time since Nadal returned to the Tour from injury that he had come from a set down to win. That pleased him immensely. “I had five months without completing a tournament. Since Shanghai until Monte Carlo I didn’t complete not one event. So the comeback has been great, no?”Yes, it has: it took Dominic Thiem on an inspired day in Madrid last week to snap his run of 50 sets on clay. He looks in the mood to resume his sequence. To reach the final, he has to beat Novak Djokovic, who showed grit to recover from an ordinary start against Kei Nishikori, winning 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 in two hours and 21 minutes.Following them on to the tournament’s cavernous showcourt on Friday Maria Sharapova found Konta’s conqueror, Jelena Ostapenko, a mirror image of bloodymindedness, the Latvian grinding her down to take the first set at the fifth attempt. Three hours and 10 minutes later it was the Russian who was smiling.She advanced to the semi‑finals with a fighting 6-7 (6), 6-4, 7-5 win that was engrossing, brutal and riddled with mistakes on both sides of the net: 21 double faults and 110 unforced errors.Ostapenko, behind in the serving cycle, needed to hold to stay on course for a two-set win, but Sharapova was equally determined. The former world No\u0026nbsp1 was as emotionless as ever when a double-fault – Ostapenko’s 10th – handed her set point. She cashed in with a cracking two-fister at a sufficiently acute angle, and they went to a third after more than two hours of attrition.There was not a lot of it that was pretty but it was don’t-look-away tennis. Hitting like prizefighters, Sharapova moved 5-2 ahead, before Ostapenko, wincing with a foot injury, reduced her arrears to 5-4. The Latvian was ecstatic when Sharapova butchered her first match point, relieved when she netted the second. At 5-5 it looked like the match would never end but it was ultimately put to bed, under lengthening shadows, when Sharapova drove a backhand down the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cffd261c5dfa71cc476844625b8bc8a4bd4f9d74/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa8a55933692e4908d549ef4e201153a","title":"simon yates retains overall giro lead elia viviani wins 13th stage sprint finish","story":"Elia Viviani won the 13th stage to make it a hat trick of wins in the Giro d’Italia while Simon Yates remained in the overall lead on Friday as the race prepares to head into the mountains.Viviani won a bunch sprint at the end of the flat 180km (112-mile) leg from Ferrara to Nervesa della Battaglia for his first victory in Italy after two wins in Israel at the start.

This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube.But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the\u0026nbspkey issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat.All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls\u0026nbspof face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and\u0026nbspmoist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No\u0026nbsp7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving\u0026nbspgrounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspfour red‑ball games over the past year. His selection\u0026nbspis at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed\u0026nbspSmith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire\u0026nbspseconds.Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk\u0026nbspthe basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed\u0026nbspthis week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English\u0026nbspcricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category\u0026nbspA sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last\u0026nbspremaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67457079307a81da7b6056c32b0a2533e86d48d/635_491_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b33d3521ab48090b551bf2691449352","title":"swan lake review royal ballet","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonThere are superlative performances – and the world’s most glamorous black tutu – in Liam Scarlett’s new take on the classicFundamentally, what I want from a production of Swan Lake is that it makes me weep for Siegfried and Odette – those two lost souls who perilously trust love to unlock them from isolation and despair. But I also need a production to convince me it has a reason for being on stage. Swan Lake is perhaps the greatest of all the fairytale ballets, yet no other classic has been subject to so many vapid or cynical retellings.The Royal’s last production was neither of those things. Yet during its 30 years on stage it never felt like a properly organic work, its cluttered, overwrought design at odds with the elegant restraint of its direction. So there is huge relief at the Opera House that its successor, choreographed by Liam Scarlett and designed by John Macfarlane, is of a very different order, a production fired by the closest of imaginative collaborations. It is far from a radical reinvention – the setting and choreography stay close to the 19th-century original – yet it stands out from so many other Swan Lakes in its attention to dramatic detail. The story’s controlling evil genius is Von Rothbart (Bennet Gartside), whom Scarlett develops far beyond the usual routine monster. Its clear that Rothbart feels a creepy kind of love for Odette (in the opening prologue his long magicians’ fingers trace her features with a malign eroticism) and his influence within the plot is extended by giving him a role in the palace as advisor to – and plotter against – the querulous, ageing Queen.Scarlett should sometimes dial down his dramatic instincts Gartside doesn’t need to stalk through act one with quite so mad a Rasputin glare. But in every other respect this first act sets the story excellently in motion. Macfarlane’s palace is oppressively formal there are guards everywhere, palace protocols and even though Siegfried is not without friends – there’s a nicely affecting dynamic between him, Benno and his two sisters – he seems to be trapped inside his own romantic loneliness.When Odette’s music calls to him deep from the enchanted forest, Macfarlane beautifully transforms the stage to a blasted lake and a Turner-esque moon (David Finn’s lighting is exemplary throughout). Scarlett’s directorial hand is subtly evident both in Rothbart’s puppeteering control of the swans and in the emotionally driven dancing of Siegfried (Vadim Muntagirov) and Odette (Marianela Nuñez). There’s a rapt tenderness between the two lovers and Nuñez, exquisitely attuned to her music, conveys the pain of Odette’s slow return to life in the wild birdlike flurries that haunt her dancing.Act three comes with a swagger of gilt – perhaps too much – but with a magnificent build-up of tension. Siegfried arrives late to the ball, the foreign princesses are entitled and predatory, and from the minute Odile arrives in the world’s most glamorous black tutu it’s clear that she and Rothbart are positioning themselves for a palace coup.The climactic pas de deux deserves a review in itself, as does all the superlative dancing from the production’s opening cast. But Scarlett’s directorial best comes in his handling of the ballet’s close. The spell over Odette may be broken as the swans turn against their captor, but the princess whom Siegfried rescues from the lake turns out be lifeless. It’s a perfectly judged ending for a 21st-century audience – and there are tears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1255421105a5e189956234f006dbc83b11cd491/565_82_2286_1371/master/2286.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfcc906ecff045a69fbc17993f8674d","title":"italy government cecile kyenge the league lega far right","story":"Cécile Kyenge, who is now an MEP, speaks out after the League agrees a power-sharing deal with M5SItaly’s first black cabinet minister has expressed deep concerns about the entry into Italy’s government of the League, as the far-right party and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) revealed plans for more detention centres to be built across the country.Cécile Kyenge, who has been a regular target of racial abuse, said the League’s position as a coalition partner in the incoming government made her less hopeful about the possibility of Italy passing immigration reforms or other changes that would ease a path to citizenship for thousands of undocumented minors.“Many members of the League accept that they are racists,” she told the . “It is very difficult for me to see that a party that accepts it is racist is going to manage law, which is supposed to protect all the community.”On Friday the League – a secessionist party previously known as the Northern League – and the Five Star Movement unveiled a power-sharing agreement for a new populist government. The deal calls for changes to fiscal policy and a €780 (£680) monthly basic income for poor families.It also spells out a new crackdown on immigration, including a “serious and efficient” programme to drive out migrants who arrive in Italy illegally. The plan calls for more detention centres to be opened in every region, in which migrants could be held for up to 18 months.The agreement calls for an overhaul of the Dublin treaty, so that asylum seekers would be distributed across the EU instead of being required to stay in the country where they first arrive, and it calls for religious leaders to be registered with the state. All camps of “unregistered” Roma would be shut down under the plan.Italy’s general election on 4 March resulted in a hung parliament. Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, and the Five Star Movement’s Luigi di Maio have been locked in negotiations for weeks to agree on a common set of governing goals. The pair have still not agreed on who should serve as prime minister. The new government’s platform is expected to be approved by M5S members late on Friday in an online poll. On Monday, Di Maio and Salvini are expected to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to formalise the launch of the government. Once a prime minister has been nominated and ministers sworn in, the government will face a vote of confidence in the parliament. Both parties ran campaigns that vilified migrants, and Salvini has attacked Italy’s Roma population throughout his political career. It is not clear whether Italy has the legal right or resources to follow through on some of the radical ideas that were agreed, but the League vowed during the electoral campaign to institute mass deportations of asylum seekers to Africa as part of a reshaping of migration policies.Immigration experts said the new agreement meant programmes seeking to integrate new migrants could be closed. “They campaign against any positive actions or programmes, which are the very basis for any minority. This keeps them in a structurally backward position,” said Francesco Palermo, a former senator who was a vocal proponent of Romany rights in Italy. “It is more populist than racist, they feel this is what the voters want, and unfortunately average Italian society is against Roma, against migrants, against sexual minorities.”Kyenge, who now serves as an MEP, has worked for years to try to change Italy’s citizenship laws so that children of migrants can be recognised as Italians. Last year the government failed to pass a law that would have eased the path to citizenship for 800,000 minors who were born in Italy or came as young children. Kyenge said these children were unable to fully participate in schools and in society. “The identity of a person begins when you are little and it is then you must have an opportunity to say ‘I am an Italian’.”The Congolese-born doctor has lived in Italy since 1983, and has been on the receiving end of deeply offensive racist slurs.

Now academics are looking to the small Flemish town for social care ideasMaria Lenaerts was seven years old when she came home from school one day to find a stranger at the kitchen table. It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. “He was sitting at the table like this,” she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. “He didn’t understand anything.”This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theDespite the language barrier, Maria’s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society.For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities.This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders’ state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities.In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma.Geel’s model of acceptance and “radical kindness” – to cite one medical journal – has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an “innovation” that is 700 years old.Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna’s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay.The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. “They have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,” says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients.Foster families are never told the patient’s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down.One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel’s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means “having a life as normal as possible”, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. “The programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. “Very often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.”For advocates, Geel’s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: “They take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes … so patients are needed and wanted.”For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. “There has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,” says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King’s College London. “In terms of outcomes for iniduals, we don’t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.”Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the  visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party.He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. “He was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,” recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter.Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster “mother”, even though she is younger.After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family.Harbant’s foster father is Maria’s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables.The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. “When Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn’t want to sit on the ward – he wants to be at home.” The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel’s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding many are opting for other kinds of residential care.Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract.The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of €600 (£535) a month. “The openness of the community is pretty high,” Bogaerts says. “We should compensate families more so it is more attractive.”Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. “It won’t last,” she says. “People have a lot of activities and recreation – they don’t have time.”None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Assange has been holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy since 2012.Among his guests were senior staff members from RT, the Moscow TV network described by US intelligence agencies as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”.The visits by RT’s London bureau chief, Nikolay Bogachikhin, who is Russian, and Afshin Rattansi, a British citizen, are likely to attract attention.WikiLeaks’ publication of the emails, which painted an unfavourable picture of Clinton, is a central focus of US federal investigators conducting a criminal inquiry into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin.Speculation has swirled as to how the hacked emails reached WikiLeaks and who was aware that WikiLeaks had the emails. It is unclear if WikiLeaks obtained them physically or remotely, with delivery to Assange in person only one possibility. The logs do not provide answers.Assange’s visitors also included well-known WikiLeaks supporters such as the designer Vivienne Westwood, the journalist John Pilger and the German hacker Andy Müller-Maguhn. Müller-Maguhn told the Washington Post that he once delivered a thumb drive with personal messages to Assange in 2016. He said he was never in possession of the hacked Democratic emails and never transported them. WikiLeaks published the first tranche of Democratic party emails on 22 July 2016. A declassified US intelligence assessment released in January 2017 found the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ordered an “influence campaign” to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost Trump. The assessment singled out RT and referred to it as a “partner” of WikiLeaks.RT told the  that the broadcaster had been invited in June 2016 to participate in a WikiLeaks Brexit special, and that arrangements to participate in the show were made during the visits to the embassy. It said its journalists had no prior knowledge that Assange was in possession of the Clinton emails and never discussed the issue with Assange.The visitor logs were drawn up by an international firm brought in by Ecuador’s then president, Rafael Correa, to provide security for Assange. The secret programme was called Operation Hotel.Among the journalists, activists and artists who visited Assange in June and July 2016 were two Russian citizens, Bogachikhin and Yana Maximova, 28, a Russian émigré to the US who has worked as a volunteer journalist for a community radio station in Portland.Assange has a longstanding relationship with RT. He has regularly appeared in interviews with the Russian broadcaster and hosted a programme on RT in 2012.According to the logs, Bogachikhin visited the embassy twice in June 2016: once on 4 June, when he entered and left within a five-minute period, and again on 8 June, for a 22-minute visit. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Bogachikhin, the head of RT in the UK, dismissed claims that it was controlled by the Kremlin, and said the broadcaster was regulated as a “reputable news organisation” by Ofcom, the British media watchdog.Bogachikhin was described by a former colleague as a journalist who had quickly risen up the ranks at RT and wholeheartedly adopted the more aggressive pro-Russian editorial line that was established after 2008. His Twitter feed mirrors Moscow’s official view. Assange was also visited twice by Maximova, who was born in St Petersburg and moved to the US when she was 18. According to the visitor logs, she visited Assange for about two hours on 8 June and for half an hour on 9 June. The 8 June meeting coincided with a visit by Sarah Harrison, who was a close Assange adviser at the time.When she was contacted by phone, Maximova declined to discuss the meetings, and said an attorney in Washington DC would provide a written statement to the , which she described as “protocol”. The attorney’s statement never materialised and Maximova did not respond to repeated follow-up phone calls.While many of Assange’s visitors are well known in professional circles, Maximova is not. On LinkedIn, her occupation is described as “Dreamer”.She volunteered as an independent journalist with the Portland community radio broadcaster KBOO, a left-leaning station, from February to October 2014, according to another former volunteer there. Maximova, who said she was in Germany, declined to answer questions about the circumstances of her emigration to the US. Rattansi made three visits to Assange in June, including one that ended at 4.30am. The RT journalist has been a staunch defender of Assange and of Putin’s government. One of the visits, on 23 June 2016 – the day the UK voted to leave the EU – Rattansi hosted a broadcast at the Ecuadorian embassy.He returned with an RT camera crew on 2 August 2016 to interview Assange about his DNC email release. Rattansi’s broadcast was titled: “Do WikiLeaks have the email that will put Hillary Clinton in prison?”RT said: “At no point during those visits was there a discussion with either Mr Bogachikhin or Mr Rattansi about emails that related to the Clinton campaign. RT learned about those emails at the same time as everyone else – when WikiLeaks began publishing them.”Assange first declared that WikiLeaks was in possession of new Clinton material on 12 June 2016, in an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday. A lawsuit filed last month against WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign by the Democratic National Committee claimed Russian intelligence agents hacked into DNC servers in April 2016. WikiLeaks began publishing the material on 22 July 2016. Assange told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that the source of the material was not a state actor.Trump has denied that his presidential campaign colluded with Russians and called a criminal investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, a “witch-hunt”.Speculation about WikiLeaks’ publication of Clinton-related emails and whether anyone had advance knowledge of the leak has circulated around key Trump campaign advisers and friends of the president, including Roger Stone. Stone tweeted about WikiLeaks having further damning information about the DNC in August, before it was released in October. He has denied any involvement and said he communicated with the organisation through an intermediary.Additional reporting by Fernando Villavicencio and Cristina Solórzano."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500472.1526662675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pupils step back in time at country s oldest primary school","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s oldest primary school. Children, suitably attired, from Powerscourt National School celebrate 200 years in Enniskerry with the release of doves. Photograph: Cyril Byrne  The Pupils at one of the country’s oldest national schools stepped back in time on Friday – kitted out in cloth caps, short trousers and high-collared blouses – to celebrate their school’s 200th anniversary.A few years ago, pupils at Powerscourt National School in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow, moved out of the original schoolhouse to a brand new, passive-energy building on the edge of village.On Friday they marched back down the hill to the old building in period dress to mark the occasion.The school, established in 1818, pre-dates the establishment of the national school system in the 1830s. It was built by local landowner Lord Powerscourt who was inspired by a local movement to provide education for the country’s poor.“Generations of children attended the old schoolhouse. It was oldest school in continuous use up until 2012,” says school principal Stephen Middleton, clad for the day in smart jacket and fetching bow tie.“We’re in a beautiful, modern school now, but we’ve kept that same sense of community. This has been a celebration for the entire village.”This was one of series of events organised by staff, parents and the wider community this week to mark the anniversary. Events include a grandparents’ day, historical talks, church service and burying a time capsule, the contents of which may puzzle future generations when opened. It includes today’s children’s must haves such as a fidget-spinner, slime and smartphone.The school came into being at a time when education was largely reserved for the most wealthy. But a small number of parish and hedge schools were scattered countrywide.Lord Powerscourt paid the salary of the school headmistress, while local children were expected to contribute about a penny a week if they could afford it. Voluntary contributions, it seems, have always been a feature of Irish education. The school was later absorbed into the national system in the 1860s. And under the patronage of the Church of Ireland local children, mostly Protestant, were educated.These days a large proportion of the school’s 92 children are still Protestant, though there are a variety of other faiths and nationalities.“We’re very much open to the entire community,” says Mr Middleton. “We’re also very lucky. It’s very scenic, with beautiful views of the Wicklow mountains, while we’re close to Powerscourt Estate, which is great for nature walks for the children.“We’re fortunate, too, that we’ve the full support of parents, grandparents and locals who attended the school, whether it was five years ago of 50 years ago. We’re still at the heart of the community effort, at a time when that’s no longer the case in many parts of the country . . . We don’t see that changing in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Experts say tisotumab vedotin potentially promising against cervical cancerPresident has not yet formally indicated if he intends to seek second termTaoiseach says he kept quiet as he did not want to be accused of influencing membersCancer-screening service intended to tell medics, but not patients, of audit resultsGalway businesses express concern about loss of revenue as result of persistent noiseSinger-songwriter says \u0026lsquoSmall Bump\u0026rsquo is not about abortion and he has not approved its useCase based on decision by Dublin Supreme Court to refer separate extradition request to European Court of Justice\u0026lsquoNobody makes the decision lightly to go to England or to order a pill across the internet\u0026rsquoResearchers say \u0026lsquono way of knowing\u0026rsquo how much is being spent on online ads ahead of referendumTeenager admitted to hospital for surgery dies of complications arising from procedureFianna F\u0026aacuteil deputy says terminations should be allowed in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormalityGarda says defendants were observed in a suspected \u0026euro100,000 drugs transactionThe 25-year-old was also charged with unlawful possession of cannabisErasmus participant did not apply to local authority and is not entitled to vote in IrelandGathering given timely reminder of the late Richard Douthwaite\u0026rsquos radical economic ideasIrish abuse survivor says clerics should face disciplinary process over alleged cover-upAnti-abortion canvassers say tone of debate on doorsteps more respectful than online"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500742.1526676188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"900 paid for ads relating to eighth amendment captured","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 230 new ads appeared on Facebook last week and  the number is increasing, the Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI) found. Photograph: Dado RuvicReuters  Nearly 900 paid-for advertisements relating to the referendum on the Eighth Amendment, including some paid for by overseas groups, have been captured by transparency researchers in the run-up to the vote on May 25th. Ads from both sides of the campaign are still appearing online, despite Facebook’s announcement earlier this month of a ban on foreign-funded ads relating to the abortion referendum.Google followed within days with a total ban on ads related to the referendum. The Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI), a voluntary initiative established to enable “open, truthful, respectful” debate during the campaign, found 230 new ads served on Facebook last week and said the number of ads was increasing. Data captured by the browsers of about 600 volunteers around the country now includes 224 unique advertiser pages relating to the campaign. Some 43 per cent of the advertisers are registered with, or affiliated with the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo), while 57 per cent were in no way affiliated with that body. Both sides of the campaign were spending on Facebook ads, with an increase in the final weeks. The researchers said some groups were untraceable and that the location, identity or intent of the person paying was not known. There were also overseas organisations paying for ads targeting Irish voters. Activity that would be regulated if it happened offline was also seen by the researchers, who found spending by overseas organisations to influence the vote, untraceable advertising with no accountability for misinformation, and spending to get high quality video ads seen by “hundreds of thousands of people”. TRI founder and transparency specialist Liz Carolan said on Friday the group had spoken to many people to try to figure out how much money was being spent online on the campaigns but said there was “no way of knowing”. “What we can see though is there is a significant amount of activity. We have no idea of how many ads are circulating in this referendum.”She noted a lot of the activity on Facebook was linking people to websites which had the capability to gather a lot of information about undecided voters. This had been seen in other contexts, where the information was cross-populated with other information an organisation had about voters. She said clips from RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live debate on Monday were also being used in some paid ads, sometimes taken out of context and not presenting a balance of views. They were presented almost as “American-style attack ads”, she said.“Those are racking up, within very short periods of time, tens of thousands of views online.”Ms Carolan said she believed there was “a need to go back to first principles on our electoral rules and try and build them so they are fit for purpose”. She said we were at a point before the referendum where there was still time to make sure we were not in the position after it where we were holding parliamentary committees, such as those held in the UK and the US after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.“I think it’s not an exaggeration to say that when two major multinational corporations for the very first time ever withdraw core products from a market because they say it’s too unregulated to operate in, it’s time for us to have a proper response and to treat that as the kind of regulatory crisis that it is.”TRI, working with researchers at the Geary Institute at UCD, found there were a number of advertisers which claimed or tried to appear neutral on the referendum, while demonstrating “bias towards or against one of the sides”. Seven advertisers posting 28 ads which appeared neutral, but which clearly favoured one side, were discovered by the advertisers.

However, he said on Friday he had reached the same conclusion as the Oireachtas body in advance but independently of the committee process.The committee recommended the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed and to permit abortion without restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr Varadkar has said legislation would be introduced along these lines if the referendum passes next Friday.The Citizens’ Assembly, which laid the ground for the Oireachtas committee, had also recommended the introduction of abortion without restriction for the first 12 weeks.“I wanted to make sure we had a proper, deliberative process,” the Taoiseach told the Don’t Stop Repealin’ podcast, citing the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee.“It was only after that work was done that I really wanted to let people know about the conclusions about that I had come to as well, which was very much in line with that. I think if I had announced where I was heading earlier I might have been accused of trying to influence or put pressure on members of the all-party committee, which I didn’t do.“Having studied the facts, they came to a similar view as I did, very much independently.”In publicly announcing his position last January, Mr Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.“In making my decision to support it, I listened to the views of others – medical experts, the public, my party and Ministers, friends. Above all, I listened to women. I had to think long and hard about the provision for abortion without a specific indication in the first 12 weeks.”A spokesman for Mr Varadkar last night said: “The Taoiseach’s own views were formed over a period of time.

Almost six out of 10 (58 per cent) of voters say they believe he should serve a second term, while 32 per cent believe he should not. Some 10 per cent of voters say they don’t know. Support for a second term for the President is consistent across regions and age groups, with the strongest support for a second term evident among wealthiest voters.In January, when The  last polled on the question, support for a second term for Mr Higgins was at a similar level, 59 per cent.The President’s term of office expires in the autumn of this year. He has not yet formally indicated if he intends to seek a second term, but the expectation in political circles is that he will, with an announcement anticipated this summer. Recently The  reported that sources familiar with the President’s thinking have advised political figures likely to support his candidacy of his decision in order to prepare for an autumn campaign. Political sources expect an announcement before the Dáil rises for its summer recess and next week’s abortion referendum. Mr Higgins previously said he would make his intentions clear by September, with a presidential election due to take place by November at the latest. Running in the presidential election of 2011, Mr Higgins – who is now 76 – said he would serve only one term but he appears to have moved away from that position and has hinted a number of times that he might seek a second term.Senator Gerard Craughwell has already said he intends to challenge Mr Higgins for the presidency, while other politicians have also indicated a possible interest.

After all, it may be already dead.“We don’t eat babies or sleep in coffins,” said Heinz Madsen, who attends the WGT meet-up as “Count von Black”, to local radio.Together with his partner Vicky, this weekend the Goth bride “Vicktoria”, the Leipzig weekend is a chance to let it all hang out.Whether Frankenstein celebrating its 200th anniversary this year – or Tim Burton’s Frankenweenie, Goths are happiest with classy gloom: castles, cemeteries, ghosts and the powerful whiff of patchouli perfume.The modern scene has its roots in 1980s England and brought forth The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. But Goth culture has ersified since then and is now a broad church that welcomes sub-scenes such as Industrial, Steampunk, Dark Wave and even something called Bat Cave.This guarantees an extravagant aesthetic – think Gay Pride meets Halloween – drawing on pagan symbols, Victorian dress and the embrace of the occult.WGT, like the Goth scene itself, is a good-natured celebration of decay, decadence and, of course, death. For that reason Mexico’s cheerier approach to death and memento mori will be celebrated this year in Leipzig, already one of eastern Germany’s most colourful cities.From humble beginnings – and just 2,000 visitors – in 1992, Leipzig’s embrace of ersity in the post-wall years has paid rich idends for local business: last year the Goth gathering attracted over 20,000 visitors from as far away as Argentina, Australia, Peru and even Japan.As well as dressing up, the gathering attracts more than 200 acts such as “The Eternal Afflict” or “Wardruna”, the Norwegian musical collective behind music in TV show Vikings.The first aesthetic highlight of the weekend was Friday afternoon’s Victorian picnic in a city park, with tea and sandwiches enjoyed in hooped skirts and top hats. Another must: a visit to the “Heathen Village” to enjoy refreshments and confess your failings while being tormented in the stocks. Those of more sensitive disposition might favour the “knitting afternoon for black romantics”.There are readings, exhibitions, film screenings and even a children’s programme to indoctrinate the Goths of tomorrow. For long-time attendees, the Wave Goth Meet-up is about escaping social norms and gender roles into a parallel world that values aesthetics and intelligence equally.“The Goth scene is important because I can live out how I want to be without someone setting rules,” said René Schuhmacher, a musician and WGT regular. “It’s not a Punch and Judy show but a way of life.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500508.1526664501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexiteers resist theresa may s proposals for customs alignment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May: Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the proposal was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border. Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"Royal wedding countdown: with the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just one day away, the excitement is mounting.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince HarryRoyal wedding: Watch live from Windsor as Prince Harry marries Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live updates: Meghan Markle arrives at Cliveden House hotel with mother Doria on eve of big day - latest news Ten killed in Texas school shooting after attacker \u0026#39walks into art class and opens fire\u0026#39Royal wedding flowers: What will Meghan Markle have in her bouquet?What time is the royal wedding?

The beginning of the day will start off cold - around 6C (43F) or 7C (45F) - but will rapidly warm up.Temperatures will peak around 3 o\u0027clock at 21C (70F) and there will be light winds - all ideal for a wedding.The mercury is expected to have reached a summery 19C (66F) by the time the couple set off in the carriage procession.After lunch hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall at the castle, the wedding party will then move on to the evening reception at nearby Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales.Once again we are expecting clear skies during the evening it will be pleasant with sunshine, but temperatures will drop relatively quickly, Mr Bowles said.At 8pm it will be around 12C (54F), but once you get past midnight it will be 8C (46F) or 9C (48F) and minimum temperatures will again be around 6C.A royal fan waits behind barriers on The Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle The sun will set at 8.53pm on Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day.

She described the flavour of the cake as being a balance of sweet and tart, combined with ethereal elderflower.The cake, which is being decorated on the outside with a white, elderflower swiss meringue buttercream, is made of layered lemon sponge, drizzled with an elderflower syrup to a recipe specially created for the couple. The layers are sandwiched with buttercream and lemon curd.Some 200 Amalfi lemons are being used in the recipe, as well as 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial made using elderflower from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, 20kgs of butter, 20 kgs of flour, 20kgs of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, and head baker Izaak Adams put finishing touches to the cakeMs Ptak said: It\u0027s a lemon sponge - a special sponge that I developed just for the couple, and we drizzle the layers with elderflower cordial from the Sandringham estate so it\u0027s really lovely and as local as you can get.We have a lemon curd made from Amalfi lemons which to me have the most delicious flavour.And then we\u0027ve got elderflower swiss meringue buttercream.The bunting is going up and the sun is shining (for now).

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the Long Walk. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, while park and walk and park and glide bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisleWhat time is the royal wedding?

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

If you are in Windsor stay where you are. If not then there’s always… If there are no royal wedding street parties round your way (for example there are believed to be none in Glasgow) then there are alternatives. Nottingham has emerged as the royal wedding street party capital of Britain, because the local council, with a fine sense of priorities in an age of austerity, is offering a £200 grant for every street party. In Brinsley, Notts, for example a mock royal wedding will take place, with kiddies plonked on a Shetland pony on their way to the church, almost like the real thing. Meanwhile, Margate’s Dreamland amusement park will emulate Windsor’s royal chapel with an inflatable bouncy church and free entry for anyone named Harry, Meghan or wearing a wedding dress (or all three). You might also try a giant live-screen event in the medieval grandeur of Winchester Cathedral or the one at Wembley’s Designer Outlet or screenings at the Southbank Centre and the Skylight rooftop bar in Tobacco Dock, most, admittedly, in London.  Live updates on the build-up to the Royal WeddingThe betrothal of HRH Prince Henry of Wales and Ms Meghan Markle off of Suits is what telly folk have been looking forward to all year, even if their viewers haven’t. So the broadcasters will be throwing their best assets into the coverage, which takes over BBC1, BBC News, ITV, and Sky News all day. Even though she’s been round this particular block a few times, Kay Burley’s breathless joyfulness at meeting another pensioner in a union jack outfit is always, well, breathlessly joyful, and balanced by the encyclopaedically knowledgeable and calm Alastair Bruce. Huw Edwards takes on the role of BBC Silvery Haired Dimbleby-in-Waiting. What those guys don’t know about royal carriages isn’t worth knowing. ITV is making do with Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, as their trump card, Tom Bradby, who actually knows the Royal Fab Four, has been unwell, though there are reports he will be a guest at the wedding.How to avoid it1. Pubs, the theatre, exhibitions – life goes on…Even in a Britain infected with a sort of royal fever, there are some who are immune to it, and will be looking for other distractions. Best choice of all would be a day spent at the The Alexandra Hotel in Derby, which has banned mention of Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and will fine (for charity) anyone heard mentioning them, and is a wedding-free zone – indeed the bar will be closing at its usual time of midnight rather than taking advantage of the general licensing hours extension to 1am.  Eccentrically, you could head down to the lovely Theatre Royal, Windsor, where there is an outside chance you can get a ticket for the highly appropriate Horrible Histories Live: More Best of Barmy Britain, featuring the likes of Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. So then you can claim you met “royals” at Windsor on the Big Day.Almost as unconventionally you could follow the true path of Diana worship and relive the glamour of her era, at the exhibition of her style and fashions being held at Kensington Palace. There’s also the Museums at Night festival, where some of the most inspiring museums including the National Gallery and Keats House are open into the night as part of the event.2. Hit the roadGiven that the great majority of the population is going be watching TV andor drunk, the roads (apart from around Windsor) will be blissfully clear for a nice long drive. Suggestions would be the A149 North Norfolk coastal route past Sandringham, listening to North Norfolk Radio, of course the A93 from Perth to Royal Deeside, taking in Balmoral and the magnificent A4086, from Capel Curig to Caernarfon, which also has an inoffensive tangential royal connection. An alternative would be take the rare opportunity to circumnavigate in a near deserted M25 in daytime a little over an hour each for the clockwise and anti-clockwise legs will tick that one off the old bucket list. For the highly, ambitious, you could try fitting all of them in over a long weekend.    3, Er, just change TV channelsYou don’t need to get on a flight to Fiji to escape the wedding (and that might not even work such is its global appeal). For there are plenty of telly alternatives, and there are some left-field choices. None more left-field than BBC Parliament’s rerun of Prime Ministers Questions, which features, by common consent, an unusually strong performance by the left-field monarch-sceptic Jeremy Corbyn. (The leader of the opposition, by the way, won’t be watching the wedding live, but on catch-up, apparently). You may instead like the look of London Live’s alternative, a classic movie about the Second World War the Malta Story (1953), featuring the incomparable Sir Alec Guinness (it’s available outside the capital online). Homeless charity enraged as police impound bus ahead of royal weddingChannel 4, who once gave us an alternative Queen’s speech with Quentin Crisp seems to have given up on the satire, sticking a triple bill of The Simpsons on instead. The brilliant thing would have been a special edition of The Simpsons starring all the Windsors and the Markle clans in their colourful glory. But, then again, maybe that is precisely the point of the royal wedding. Conversation for the royalistsThese are fairly obvious, and will be endlessly churned during the coverage on the day, but here is a short checklist for the topics:1. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is setting new standards for restrained good taste and 10 is WTF awful, how ridiculous are Beatrice and Eugenie’s hatsfascinators? 2. Isn’t the 96-year old Duke of Edinburgh doing well on his new hip ? 3. Where does Meghan’s wedding dress rank in the pantheon of frocks running from, say, Princess Elizabeth in 1947 through Margaret (1960), Anne (1973 and 1992), Diana (1981), Fergiana (1986), Sophie (1999), Camilla (2005) and Kate (2011). Ditto the ring, the kiss, the size of the crowd. 4. How’s Pippa looking (front and rear)? 5. The Palace shouldshould not have done more for Meghan’s family to protect them from the media and the paps (caution: this could take all day).6. Starting with Prince Charles, how far down the order of succession to the throne can you get without recourse to Wikipedia? Can you make it to Zenouska Mowatt (number 57)? Conversation for the republicans1. How should an elected head of state be chosen: direct vote of the people by parliament, or Commons alone by exhaustive ballot or resolution of the house by a Labour Party-style electoral college including the unions via online poll by Simon Cowell and Tom Jones by a Congress of People’s Soviets?2. Try and think of the best offensive headline for a fantasy left-wing paper front page, based on some classics from the Morning Star and Socialist Worker from the 1980s, eg “Parasite Marries Scrounger” (Sarah Ferguson and Andrew) or “Noddy to Wed Big Ears” (Diana Spencer and Charles). 3. Is the biracial Meghan a step forwards or backwards for progressive politics?4. Who is paying for all this?​​TV coverage of the royal wedding starts from 9amor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It emphasises direct democracy and sits in Ukip’s group in the European parliament.Friday’s joint programme makes no mention of the parties’ stance on the EU or the euro, leaving the situation ambiguous. Officials in Brussels are worried that the parties will pick fights with the EU institutions if they get into government in one of the EU’s founding states.League leader Matteo Salvini said he and Five Star leader Luigi di Maio would meet with Italy’s mostly ceremonial president on Monday to form a government if their members signed off on the plan in votes due to be held before Sunday.“Days and nights of work,” he said in a statement on social media. “Do you like it?”The Five Star Movement won the most votes in March’s elections, garnering 32.7 per cent.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

It\u0026rsquos really important in China that change is also seen to come from within.HSI says it is urging central and local government to implement an action plan to crack down on Yulin with road blocks before the festival starts so that trucks stuffed with dogs and cats can be stopped from entering the city.It also wants temporary emergency shelters, run in partnership with expert animal groups with the veterinary skills, to be set up to care for confiscated animals as well as a nationwide public information campaign to alert dog traders that they will stopped from entering Yulin and face punishment.Humane Society InternationalThere are calls for authorities to provide packages for dog meat traders to move into new business.There are also calls for authorities to provide packages for dog meat traders to move them into new business.\u0026ldquoUntil the dog traders invented the Yulin festival in 2010, there was no history of dog eating in the city and so it\u0026rsquos entirely feasible to help traders move on, added Ms Higgins.\u0026ldquoUltimately, of course, China needs a robust animal protection law because right now there is nothing to protect these animals from harm at all."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/royal-wedding-anne-961625.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding latest Princess Anne Windsor Mia Tindall bridesmaid","story":"Anne, who lives at Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire, was seen carrying bags into the helicopter in the royal grounds in West London.But four-year-old granddaughter Mia, who was tipped to be a bridesmaid before this week\u0027s announcement, will not be one of the young stars helping the Harry and Meghan tomorrow, with the royal couple deciding to offer more roles to friends\u0026rsquo children rather than relatives.Royal correspondent, Duncan Larcombe, told Good Housekeeping: \u0026ldquoI guess they wanted Meghan to be represented and therefore not choose too many royals.And Mia is believed to not be attending the Windsor Castle wedding, but parents Zara and Mike Tindall will be there.Kensington Palace released the names of the 10 young bridesmaids and pageboys who will be at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle yesterday.Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, have been included in the line-up featuring all youngsters.The list includes several goddaughters of both Meghan and Harry, plus Alice van Cutsem, the cousin of Grace van Cutsem.Grace was famously pictured at Kate and Willam\u0027s 2011 wedding pulling grumpy faces with her hands over her ears during the Buckingham Palace balcony festivities.It also includes the daughters and sons of some of Meghan\u0027s closest friends including stylist Jessica Mulroney.REUTERSRoyal Wedding: Princess Anne pictured leaving Kensington Palace this morningSpeaking ahead of the event, Mike, the former England rugby captain who married into the Royal family, said he was welcomed with open arms by them, and that Meghan Markle should just try and enjoy her wedding day.The former England centre, who married the Queen\u0027s granddaughter Zara Phillips in 2011 said of Ms Markle: I think she\u0027ll be nervous, but coming from her background in TV she\u0027s used to public spotlight.Not quite as much probably as has gone on this week, but she\u0027ll be fine and I think she\u0027s experienced enough to know that all she can do is enjoy the day.

On the back of the stalls are nearly 800 plates which commemorate Knights of the Garter past and present.On the High Altar is a jewelled Cross, given by Queen Victoria, and two silver gilt candlesticks dating from the reign of King Charles II.Also displayed are three gilt dishes of very great size, elaborately embossed one was intended to have been the gift of Mary of Orange, sister of King Charles II, while the other two smaller dishes are the gift of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of the future King James II.Looking down on the Quire from above is the wooden oriel window installed in the Chantry Chapel of King Edward IV by King Henry VIII so that his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, might watch the ceremonies of the Installation of Knights of the Garter in the Quire below.The window bears the arms of Henry and Katherine and the intertwined Tudor Rose of England and the Pomegranate of Aragon.It has frequently been used as a Royal Pew or watching chamber and it was from this vantage point that Queen Victoria watched the wedding in the Chapel below of her son, the Prince of Wales, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863.It was at this same wedding that the fine East Window, created by Messrs Clayton and Bell in commemoration of the late Prince Albert, was first seen.The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, Archbishop of CanterburyPRAYERGOD of love,send your blessing upon Harry and Meghan,and all who are joined in marriage,that, rejoicing in your willand continuing under your protection,they may both live and growin your love all their days,through Jesus Christ our Lord.AmenThe service is led by The Right Reverend David Conner KCVO, Dean of Windsor.The marriage is solemnised by The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0027s Chapel, conducted by Mr James Vivian, Director of Music, St George\u0027s Chapel.

No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. HARRY and MEGHAN are now to enter this way of life.They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring.We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God\u0027s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together.All stand.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0026rsquos Chapel.THE HYMNLORD of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,Whose trust, ever child-like,no cares could destroy,Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,at the break of the day.Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,Whose strong handswere skilled at the plane and the lathe,Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,Your strength in our hearts, Lord,at the noon of the day.Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,Your hands swift to welcome,your arms to embrace,Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,Your love in our hearts, Lord,at the eve of the day.Jan Struther (1901-53) \u0027Slane\u0027, Traditional Irish MelodyAll remain standing as the Archbishop leadsExplore London like Meghan and Harry with this pick of London spots connected to the royal couple                    Instagram1 of 16Chelsea in Bloom is one of the attractions London\u0027s King\u0026rsquos Road has to offerTHE DECLARATIONSFIRST, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.The Archbishop says to the CoupleTHE vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.The Archbishop says to the BridegroomHARRY, will you take MEGHAN to be your wife?Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?He answersI will.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey.The Archbishop says to the BrideMEGHAN, will you take HARRY to be your husband?Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?She answersI will.The Archbishop says to the congregationWILL you, the families and friends of HARRY and MEGHAN, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?All answerWe will.The Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he saysMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026rsquos love story in pictures.

Heres what we know about who will be attending the big day.The wedding invitations were printed on March 22, and the couple have kept fairly tight-lipped about their guest list.There wont be as many wedding guests as when Prince William tied the knot in 2011, but it has been confirmed that Harrys older brother will be the best man.Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests but St Georges chapel, Harry and Meghans venue, can hold 800 people.They will also invite 2,640 members of the public on the day to the Windsor Castle grounds including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities. Around 600 people have been invited to the service which takes place at St Georges Chapel on Saturday May 19.Unfortunately those wanting a glimpse of Prince Louis on the day will be disappointed, as the palace has confirmed he wont be attending - instead being cared for by a nanny nearby on the day.It was confirmed on May 16 that Prince George will be page boy and Princess Charlotte will be a bridesmaid at the Royal Wedding.On Harrys invite list were ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, it is likely some Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan also made the cut.Meghans older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, have not be invited on the big day.Her nephew, Thomas Jrs son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list. Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, will be attending, and her father, Thomas Markle Sr, had plananed to walk his daughter down the aisle.However, on May 14, US media reported that he had been struck down by a heart problem and pulled out of the ceremony after realising he might be too ill to make the trip.It has since been reported that Thomas Sr underwent heart surgery on May 16, and while the operation was successful, he will not be attending his daughters nuptials.On May 17, Meghan released an official statement via Kensington Palace confirming her father will not be attending the ceremony on Saturday to focus on his health.All three of Princess Dianas siblings will be in attendance - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer.Lady Jane Fellowes will be giving the reading.A fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh were believed to have been in the running for bridesmaid duty, but it has since been revealed that Meghans bridesmaids are all children and she will not have a maid of honour.Protocol normally means that royal brides do not have adult bridesmaids, although Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule.At the very least, we expect to see a few of Meghan’s mates as guests at the wedding – as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who’s thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.Its inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals.One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harrys guests during his special Radio 4 appearance – and he wants a starring role.It has also been reported that two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and his wife, Princess Mabereng, who have worked alongside the Prince and his charity Sentebale since 2006, will also attend.In addition to Donald Trump, a whole host of political big names including President Obama, his wife Michelle, and Theresa May have reportedly not made the cut.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markles wedding.Her Majestys Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.The Sun has revealed that Elton John will be attending the Royal Wedding.The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.Mel sternly said: “Im not saying any more,” but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice, also confirmed she had received a coveted invitation.It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sank to their lowest ebb since his election last year.And as the big day approaches, the ushers, bridesmaids and page boys have been revealed.Ushers:Bridesmaids:Page boys:The Sun Online exclusively revealed that Lady Amelia Windsor has been snubbed by the royal couple and she is not invited to the wedding.The Edinburgh student and her older sister Marina, 25, have failed to bag an invitation to the wedding of the year.A friend said: “They were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going.“Amelia is creating quite a name for herself with her modelling and Instagram posts.“Perhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn’t want anyone upstaging the bride.”Lady Amelia and Lady Marina are William and Harrys third cousins - granddaughters of the Duke of Kent who is the Queens cousin.Numerous members of the public are selected to watch outside the chapel when the couple get married. These include:The Suns Bizarre column exclusively revealed that the Foo Fighters have dropped hints they want to perform at the wedding.Frontman Dave Grohl said: “I’ve saved the date. The performance was good.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly says the Tories are wasting their breath since he intends to reject either solution.He is stoking the Irish border problem and privately mocking Mrs May’s discomfort. It is dangerously destructive. We should challenge Brussels to help us make Boris’s solution work. If it won’t help, we should walk away. It would be bad for the EU, Barnier and us. But it looks more inevitable by the day.SIXTY dead, thousands allegedly wounded. The Gaza bloodbath should horrify even Israel’s staunchest supporters.It is hard to argue that shooting live rounds into a crowd is proportionate. But consider the terrifying threat Israel faces. This was not a peaceful demo. Hamas, the terror group sworn to wipe Israel off the map, aims to use it to penetrate the border and kidnap Jews.“We will tear out their hearts,” its leader has said. Some Jewish families live near the fence. Israel is right to fear for them.But its ruthlessness has handed Hamas the PR coup it cynically craves.MPs have again spared the Press and public a costly new “Leveson 2” witch-hunt.We congratulate Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and the 301 MPs who put Press freedom first. We doubt the rest, the Lords or Hacked Off will ever call it a day. But the media has changed beyond recognition since the last inquiry. Facebook and Google dominate. Newspapers are fighting for life.Campaigners should refocus away from their grudges and the distant past.It is more important to consider how a viable, noisy free Press can survive.THE vast sums blown on misguided ­Government environment obsessions are a monumental scandal.One £23billion scheme launched in 2011 to help people install heating systems using renewables was a huge flop.A Commons committee says forecasts were wildly over-optimistic, yet the Energy Department has since learned no lessons from it.Some politicians shouldn’t be trusted to boil a kettle, let alone run an energy budget worth billions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dhuhr is observed shortly after noon to again remember God and seek his guidance.Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.The Suhur is consumed in the morning, as early as 2.30am, in the latter stages of the holy month.Breads, potatoes, eggs and rice are typically enjoyed as part of the Suhur, in addition to dairy products and fresh vegetables.The Iftar is a blessing, often enjoyed as a community, after sunset. This can be as late as 9.40pm in the latter part of the holy month.Fruits and vegetables are usually big parts of the Iftar, as are many delicacies unique to the Islam religion.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mrs May cannot even rely on her own MPs.Consider what she’s up against:An EU which has spent two years playing games, either to reverse Brexit or extract a fortune from us while nullifying us as an economic threat.Unelected peers, contemptuous not only of the referendum verdict but the democracy that produced it.Tory backbenchers putting their party’s very existence a distant second to getting their own way on Europe.And a Labour Party solely concerned with ousting the Tories, even if it means wrecking our negotiating strategy.The PM’s task is being made impossible.THE problem on some of our train lines is not that they need to be nationalised.

It’s based on a couple of premises not a single country would be able to accept.“The costs are big and even then you don’t end up with a smooth border. You could perhaps have Max Fac in 2085, but it’s not readily available now or even in three to five years. It would be the miracle solution.”The official said the UK and EU could agree to either change the end date for the transition, currently set for December 2020, or to roll it over until an answer is found.They said: “There’s no legal limit, so in truth it will be a political decision in the end. It would be a bit more complicated if it’s really indefinite in time.”And they insisted EU leaders will not let the UK crash out without a deal given the risks that would pose to their economies.They revealed: “Leaders won’t want to take any additional risk that would dampen growth even more. There’s still a lot of common sense out there.”They made the remarks as it emerged Brexiteers have lost the battle within Cabinet over keeping us in the Customs Union beyond 2021.Ministers have thrashed out the compromise as an alternative to Brussels’ backstop proposal, which would see Northern Ireland stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.But it is likely to be immediately rejected by Eurocrats, who will insist the UK must extend the whole transition if it cannot find another way to avoid a hard border.They will also demand that Britain still signs up to a legal promise of a backstop regardless, with trust between the two sides over the issue at rock bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

St John tells us how Jesus shared in such an occasion at Cana, and gave there a sign of new beginnings as he turned water into wine.Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and in bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children. For Christians, marriage is also an invitation to share life together in the spirit of Jesus Christ.It is based upon a solemn, public and life-long covenant between a man and a woman, declared and celebrated in the presence of God and before witnesses.On this their wedding day the bride and bridegroom face each other, make their promises and receive Gods blessing.

The Dean of Windsor readsIN the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we have come together to witness the marriage of HENRY CHARLES ALBERT DAVID and RACHEL MEGHAN, to pray for Gods blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. Marriage is a way of life made holy by God, and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community.

But the “transition” was time-limited. This effectively extends that. When would it ever end? When the EU finally decides it is happy for new technology to monitor the Irish border.Never, in other words.It is already sneering it will take till 2085. It will use any excuse.We are told Britain would be free to sign trade deals during that time. But how could we negotiate without the flexibility to diverge from EU rules?We would be nominally “out”, yet forever marching in lockstep with it over trade. “Perpetual purgatory”, as Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly calls it.Theresa May is under huge pressure. But this is not seizing the opportunity Brexit presents. It is defeatism, attempted damage limitation without realising the REAL damage of a half-Brexit.The Cabinet is running scared of Brussels and Tory Remainers, as the EU ratchets up the panic.The alternative is to leave with no deal. But we are failing abjectly to prepare for that.It will cost us dear.IT is a national disgrace that shale gas was successfully demonised by a ­campaign of hysteria and lies.This is a potentially immense energy resource beneath our feet which could power the country cheaply for decades.But eco warriors’ baseless scaremongering about the environmental risks, amplified by social media and grossly irresponsible politicians, has prevailed.The tall tales were debunked, but the public remains afraid of fracking.We salute the Government, then, for finally grasping the nettle with measures to help firms explore for shale and compel councils to approve it.Not long ago we were self-sufficient for energy. Now we partly rely on the murderous, flaky Putin regime’s gas. We have to get cracking with fracking, like the US.And the Government must launch a PR offensive to convince a doubting nation it is clean and safe.IT would be insane not to ban combustible cladding on tower blocks after Grenfell.And it should be mandatory to test panels physically.We know the tragedy had several causes. We accept Dame Judith Hackitt’s damning view of a building regulations system unfit for purpose.But 71 people died. Why risk more lives with dodgy panels?The Government is already spending £400million removing them nationwide.It must thank Dame Judith for her report — then swiftly take far tougher action than she has in mind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At that point I decided to just walk away.”The photograph shows a grey-haired man with his pants down.Holding a piece of toilet paper, he is squatting over a concrete path by a brick wall and looking in the direction of the camera.Steve has since discovered that the man is married, and lives in a well-kept house with a manicured garden not far from the apartment block in the southeastern Brisbane suburb of Greenslopes.Steve wrote on Facebook that the man was a Greenslopes resident but he was “not sharing his name at this stage, unless he continues to do it”.“Hopefully someone (either friend, acquaintance or even his employer) will recognise him,” the commenter said.“I can see no reasonable excuse for his filthy and disgusting behaviour. The fact that he has done this on numerous occasions makes it even worse!”.Steve has distributed the poster in a local letter drop to houses including the one in which the poo jogger lives.Last year, a female jogger in Colorado dubbed the Mad Pooper left a family at their wits end when she repeatedly defecated in front of their home.He said that the man ran past on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, but did not stop to relieve himself on the path every time.“He ran straight past on Monday,” Steve said.He and other neighbours had tried to talk to the man, to no avail.Facebook users suggested having a police car outside the apartment block, and another said he hoped the photograph would “shame the police to take it seriously”.But it was pointed out that, at best, the man could be charged with trespass and be served with a notice.“As it is on private property the police cannot really do anything. If he was crapping like this on public property, he could be charged with disorderly behaviour,” a Facebook poster wrote.Steve told news.au he had been hoping police could go and have a talk with the man, but was now hoping the photograph might deter him from doing it again.This article originally appeared on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bercow.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow andrea leadsom theresa may","story":"The PM said claims the Commons boss also branded Andrea Leadsom “f***** useless” were unacceptable and must be investigated.And she refused to say the PM had full confidence in the under-fire official.It follows a decision by the Standards Committee to block a probe into bullying claims made against the Speaker.Last night Mrs Leadsom said she was concentrating on ensuring “anyone who is bullied or treated unfairly in Parliament is able to have their concerns and complaints dealt with in a rigorous and fair manner”.A No 10 spokeswoman said: “We have seen the alleged remarks.“Clearly the Prime Minister thinks they are unacceptable.

So I can do what I want!” And he made the most of it.Harry’s cheeky sense of humour and ­happy-go-lucky nature made him instantly lovable.Trying to make life “normal”, Diana took her boys to theme parks, ­fast-food joints and trips to the cinema.As they got older, ­visits to Aids clinics, homeless shelters and kids’ charities showed the boys how other people lived.But even Diana’s patience was tested by the young prince.Inspector Ken Wharfe, who looked after the young princes and Diana, says the angriest he ever saw her was when she was telling off Harry for hitting William with a snooker cue while they stayed on Richard Branson’s Caribbean island Necker.He said: “Harry was always pushing the boundaries. That was never the case with William.”Harry was not academic and struggled with his schooling.He started at Mrs Mynors’ ­nursery school in London’s Notting Hill in 1987 before going to ­Wetherby School in 1989.He began boarding at Ludgrove Prep in 1992. While there he was told his parents were separating — they divorced in 1996.The fallout of Charles and Diana’s ­marriage ending had a big impact on their sons.But Diana’s death in August 1997, when Harry was just 12, changed him for life.Struggling with this tremendous loss, on September 6, 1997, Prince Harry walked past thousands of people who had gathered to say goodbye to the woman many had dubbed “the People’s Princess.”He trailed behind his mother’s coffin in the funeral procession along with his brother, father and grandfather Prince Philip.He was held back a year at Ludgrove before passing the entrance exam to Eton in 1998.Like other teens, Harry liked to party — and he hit the headlines in 2001 and 2002 for drinking and smoking pot.He spent a gap year travelling through Africa, Argentina and Australia in 2003.He started ­dating Zimbabwean Chelsy Davy in 2004 and their on-off relationship would last until 2011.Harry enrolled at Sandhurst in 2005 to train in the Army.In April 2006, he joined the Household Cavalry as a Blues and Royals officer.He spent ten very happy years in the Army, latterly as an Apache helicopter ­gunner, and secretly completed two tours of ­Afghanistan before leaving in 2015.In April 2014 he split with actress Cressida Bonas, his second serious girlfriend.Harry went on a blind date in June 2016 with American actress Meghan Markle . . . and they got engaged in November last year.With his party exploits in the past, Harry is now best known for his charity work and founding the Invictus Games for injured troops.Im proud of who I am... a confident womanRACHEL MEGHAN MARKLE was raised mostly by her mum, Doria Ragland, in Los Angeles.Doria and Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, got divorced when she was six.It was a second marriage for Tom, who has children Samantha and Tom ­Jnr with his first wife, Roslyn Loveless.Describing her heritage, Meghan said: “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African-American.“I’m half-black and half-white. I have come to embrace (this and) say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident, mixed-race woman.”The young Meghan found it quite tough to split her time between social worker and yoga instructor Doria and dad Tom, ­a ­Hollywood lighting director.But she enjoyed spending time with him on set and he paid to send her to private school.Meghan attended the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse primary and the all-girls ­Catholic Immaculate Heart High School.And she developed an outspoken voice at a young age.Aged 11, she wrote to then First Lady Hillary Clinton and the ­makers of a TV advert that ­featured the line: “Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.”When her male classmates saw the ad and yelled that the kitchen is where women belonged, Meghan complained about what she saw as the slogan’s sexist assumption.She was delighted when her letter-writing campaign led to the ad’s wording being changed from “women” to “people”.Meghan — who was born on August 4, 1981, and shares a birthday with Prince Harry’s great-grandmother the Queen Mum — went on to study theatre and international relations at Northwestern University School of Communication.She graduated in 2003.As an aspiring actress, she struggled at first to make ends meet, waitressing and appearing as a game show glamour girl in the US ­version of Deal Or No Deal.In 2002, Meg landed her first TV acting role with a guest spot on daytime soap General Hospital.She went on to appear in a number of other series, including sitcoms Cuts and The War At Home, as well as the dramas CSI:NY and 90210.As a biracial actress, Meghan would later talk about the ­challenges of trying to get cast in racially specific roles while also finding her voice as a performer.Her big break came in 2011 when she ­landed the part of ­paralegal Rachel Zane on the US series Suits, which co-starred Gabriel Macht, Patrick J Adams and Gina Torres.The show became a top ­performer among USA Network’s scripted programmes.Set in a Manhattan corporate law firm, the legal drama sees savvy Zane attending Columbia Law School to pursue her dreams of becoming an attorney.Meghan left the show last year after filming her on-screen wedding.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKShe also founded a popular lifestyle blog called The Tig.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres what you need to know about him...Michael Curry was born in Chicago on March 13, 1953 and went to school in Buffalo, in the state of New York.He revealed in his autobiography that both his mother and father were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.The 65-year-old was ordained as a deacon in June, 1978 and as a priest six months later.Curry held posts in North Carolina, Ohio and Maryland before being consecrated as the 11th bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina in 2000.In 2015, he became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, which is Anglican like the Church of England.The Episcopal Church – based in New York – is one of just two Anglican churches which allows gay marriage in church, and Curry drew some controversy by backing the move.As well as equal marriage, during his career the bishop has been outspoken on issues of social justice and immigration policy.Harry and Meghans wedding ceremony is being presided over by the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury, with Curry delivering the address.Following the announcement of his role he said: The love that has brought and will bind Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle together has its source and origin in God, and is the key to life and happiness.And so we celebrate and pray for them today.On Twitter, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as a brilliant pastor, a stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.Royal Wedding guests will begin to arrive between 09.30am and 11.00am.Members of the royal family will get there from 11.20am, and Meghan and Harrys marriage ceremony is due to start at 12.00pm.The service itself is expected to last for around an hour, with Conner joined by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who will officiate as the couple make their vows.9.30-11.00: Wedding guests arrive at the Castles famous Round Tower by coach and enter the chapel through the South Door and take their seats.11.20: Members of the royal family begin to arrive and enter via the Galilee Porch, some on foot others by car.11.45: Possibly around this time Harry and his brother the Duke of Cambridge arrive at the Chapels West Steps, probably on foot walking past the thousands of spectators invited into the grounds of the castle. The moment will give Harry the chance to acknowledge the 200 representatives from charities he is associated with gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps.11.55-11.59: Following protocol, the Queen will be the last member of the royal family to arrive for the wedding service.11.59: Ms Markle arrives at the Chapels West Steps by car, from her overnight accommodation, with some of her bridesmaids and pageboys.She will start her journey, which will take her past some of the crowds in the Long Walk, with her mother Doria Ragland - but when the car stops at the castle her mother will exchange places with her bridesmaids and pageboys.Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch and in the absence of Meghans father Thomas Markle Prince Charles will meet her halfway down the aisle.12.00: Service starts.1.00pm: Service ends and the newlyweds emerge at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St Georges Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.1.05pm: Around this time the carriage procession through the streets of Windsor will begin, taking 25 minutes.7.00pm: Bride and groom departing Windsor castle for the evening reception Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales.The couple will tie the knot at St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle, which offers a more low key venue than Westminster Abbey, where Kate Middleton and Prince William got married.Meghan and Harrys venue can accommodate 800 guests, whereas the Abbey seats 2,000.Its setting will also offer the couple and their famous friends and family some privacy on what is sure to be a major global news event.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, it is not known whether that will be in the wedding chapel or at the Frogmore reception, or both.Sir Elton holds a special place in Harry\u0027s heart as the singer was a close friend of his late mother, Diana, and penned and performed Candle in the Wind for her funeral in 1997.The Rocketman singer also attended William and Kate\u0027s wedding in 2011 and he has rescheduled two concert dates which were meant to be happening this weekend.Keeping with the British theme, there were rumours the Spice Girls may also sing, with Mel B - Scary Spice - apparently letting slip that the band would be performing at the royal wedding.:: Royal wedding 2018: The ultimate guide However, Mel C - Sporty Spice - then said she was \"joking\".Chart toppers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Stormzy have also thrown their hats in the ring, all expressing interest in playing for the newest royal couple.As Hereford-born Ellie Goulding, a friend of Harry\u0027s, sang at William and Kate\u0027s wedding, it is unlikely she will perform at Saturday\u0027s reception.:: Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars arrive for royal wedding Some veteran acts could also be entertaining the couple and their friends and family.Another question will be what Meghan will be wearing for the reception.Her wedding dress, which is rumoured to have cost \u0026#163100,000 - paid for by herself - is sure to be the star of the show, just as Kate\u0027s was in 2011.Like her future sister-in-law, she is expected to change into something which is a bit easier to dance in for the reception. As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party.In America, during the cake-cutting ceremony the newslyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces. The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in America, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends, remains to be seen.

And that is why today\u0027s announcement has sparked such outrage.On the one side there are those who think that controlling the scope of betting machines amounts to proof of a nanny state.The Government is meddling, they say, and it will cost jobs and destroy fun. If people want to waste their money on betting machines with a paltry chance at making a profit, so the argument goes, who are we to stop them.On the other side are those who point at the victims of gambling addiction, and who believe that the state\u0027s role is, basically, to stop people doing things that are bad for them, their families and, you might say, for society at large.Now it is hard to say that fixed-odds betting terminals do any social good. Yes, they raise money for the Treasury, and help bolster the profits of some - but not all - betting companies.It may be that some people find them fun, just as some people think fox hunting is fun, but social good? Hardly.The flip side is that it is hard to argue that they don\u0027t do harm - there are many stories of players frantically spending the family savings, of desperate addiction, and of the hapless inadequacy of the existing laws to stop repeat losers.One gambler lost \u0026#16314,000 in seven hours others have been convicted after smashing up shops in desperate fury.The industry will have us believe that these people will all drift to alternative locations - amusement arcades, casinos and shadowy back-street suppliers. The problem, they say, will just be moved elsewhere. What\u0027s more, so we are told, the collapse of these machines will also result in hundreds of shops closing, thousands of job losses, and a huge hit to the Exchequer.And yet sometimes Governments are there to make these sort of judgements.Presumably, somewhere, there are people who were laid off when the local land-mine factory closed.At the end of the First World War, workers were laid off from the factory in Avonmouth where Britain had been making mustard gas. It\u0027s not good enough, frankly, to defend something purely on the grounds that an industry supports jobs.As for the Treasury - that\u0027s a matter for the Government. But within the context of the nation\u0027s tax take, it\u0027s not a big loss, particularly when set off against the plans to impose a different levy on the betting industry.Our giant betting companies are all profitable enterprises, whose future is not dependent upon these machines.

We told how the Prime Minister hoped to “bury the bad news” she was sending another batch of party loyalists to the bloated House of Lords, which is already stuffed with about 800 peers.  And sure enough, at 4.55pm, nine new Conservatives were ennobled in an announcement overshadowed by the run-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s nuptials tomorrow. The Tory cronies who will take ermine include ex-Social Secretary Peter Lilley and former Cabinet heavyweight Sir Eric Pickles, as we predicted. In total, six former MPs become Conservative peers, as does the party’s former deputy chairman Amanda Sater, and SafeLives charity founder Diana Barran. But former Chancellor George Osborne was snubbed. Ex-MP William McCrea, of the DUP , which props up Mrs May’s minority administration, also becomes a peer. The move came after Mrs May was humiliated by 15 Brexit defeats in the un-elected Chamber, where she does not have a majority. Labour was given three new peerages: former party general secretary Iain McNicol, veteran campaign Martha Osamor, mother of Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor, and author Pauline Bryan. Electoral Reform Society Chief Executive Darren Hughes accused the PM of hiding the announcement “behind the euphoria of a Royal Wedding ”.

Instead of grounding, taking sweets away and removing the television, almost two thirds of mums now threaten a complete ban on the game if their children misbehave. With some 40million players worldwide, British children as young as eight are playing the game for more than 13 hours every week. But a study of 858 parents of Fortnite-loving kids shows 54 per cent are concerned about the negative effects of the game. In particular, the average family polled endures 11 arguments a month because kids want to spend longer playing the irresistible survival shoot-outs.  Siobhan Freegard, founder of ChannelMum , which commissioned the research, said: “Our advice to parents is not to panic about Fortnite.   “Played sensibly it’s fun, sociable and can even help some children’s co-ordination skills. “But like any habit, if it takes over all other activities, then it needs to be managed sensibly with limits imposed. “Agree with your child what is acceptable use and ensure they stick to it. It may cause a Battle Royale in your home but it will be better for them long-term to have boundaries. “However even if you fear your child is a Fortnite addict, just wait a few months and they’ll forget all about it when the next craze comes in. “A few years ago it was Minecraft, and next year it will be something else. “Playgrounds are fickle places and even the most popular games don’t stay top of the leader board forever.”  The study found 63 per cent of parents find themselves arguing constantly about the attitude they receive when asking the child to come off the computer. Other common rows are about how much time is spent playing (54 per cent), the amount of money spent on in-game purchases (39 per cent) and the general bad attitude (53 per cent). A fifth of kids have landed in hot water after being found playing the game when they shouldn’t and 28 per cent have been told off for ignoring what they’ve been told to do. Seven per cent of parents have found themselves faced with a huge bill after their children racked up in-game purchases. Four in 10 parents are even convinced their child’s performance at school has been impaired due to the game and a fifth are concerned their kids think the game is more important than real life. However, six in 10 mums and dads do agree the game IS suitable for children under 16 - due to its relatively mild violence, catchy dances such as the ‘floss’ and silly, fun sense of humour. Just under half of parents like the fact the game is sociable, while 43 per cent say it’s nice to see their children so animated and excited about something.

A new study has lifted the pastry lid on the pies we most enjoy to tuck into, as well as our opinions regarding the classic pub grub staple. In terms of sweet treats, the apple pie was considered the best of the bunch. And on the savoury scale, steak and ale topped the charts, closely followed by steak and kidney and chicken and mushroom. In fact, the humble steak and kidney pie has been voted more quintessentially British than classic dishes like bangers and mash, bubble and squeak and toad in the hole.  Online casino Casumo commissioned the survey in support of their Play Absurd campaign, which sees comedian Paul Foot attempting to best the world’s fastest pie-scoffers in the Pie Eating World Championships in Wigan.    Greg Tatton-Brown from online casino Casumo , said: “When thinking about a food that Brits all love, a delicious pie is never far from the top.  “Whether savoury like a steak and kidney or sweet with a filling of apple, there are very few people who would turn down a slice of the pastry-wrapped treat. “Our survey found savoury pies are far more popular than sweet, however, which is perhaps due to them most commonly being found at football grounds around the country.” Savoury pies are favoured by 42 per cent of the population, though 44 per cent have no preference whether their pie is sweet or meaty. In order to be considered a pie in its true form the dish must have its filling entirely encased – meaning sides and a lid – in pastry, accord to three in five discerning Brits.  Twenty-seven per cent think a pie isn’t a pie unless it has a meaty filling, and one in six think there must be a rich gravy contained inside the pastry casing. When it comes to the matter of pastry, shortcrust is the variety of choice for 37 per cent of pie enthusiasts. One in four would prefer the light texture of puff pastry, and 10 per cent enjoy a flaky pastry.  The classification of the shepherd’s pie as an official, bona fide pie has long been a controversial decision, and 45 per cent of Brits say the mash-topped treat shouldn’t be considered as such. A further 21 per cent think it should be featured in the pie category, while the remaining 34 per cent couldn’t make a decision one way or the other. It also emerged the average Brit will eat three pies a month, with chips the ultimate side of choice, followed by mash, roast potatoes and mushy peas.  Fifty-four per cent have made a pie at home themselves, and most would rather suffer a burnt crust than a soggy bottom on pulling their creation out of the oven. Brits have also tried some truly bizarre pies in their culinary past, including one bought in Ecuador that contained iguana meat and another containing nettles. Greg Tatton-Brown added: “Pies aren’t just great for eating, they can make for entertainment as well – pie-eating contests take place around the world.

Paul Duffy had been given a court order forcing him to sell the \u0026pound320,000 home in Ratby, Leicestershire, after a lengthy battle.  The blast destroyed the building and shattered a neighbour\u0027s ground floor windows, the Leicester Mercury reports.  Duffy, 57, lapsed the buildings insurance and doused the empty premises in fuel before igniting it, knowing he was due to be evicted any day. People living in two nearby streets were evacuated when the emergency services attended. Duffy, a self-employed window fitter, claimed to have been blown out of the house. He then went into nearby woods intending to kill himself - but changed his mind and returned to the scene to confess.  Duffy admitted committing arson in the early hours of Tuesday April 17. At Leicester Crown Court yesterday Andrew Peet, prosecuting, said the defendant and his ex-partner, Mary Williams, were in a “volatile and unhappy” relationship, which began in 1997 and broke down in 2015. He said: “The defendant can be described as being a bully who exercised a degree of control of his partner, the mother of his two daughters. “The defendant was the legal owner of the house in Church Lane, with the mortgage in his name.” Ms Williams had contributed “significantly” to the deposit and stood to gain in excess of \u0026pound50,000 from the sale, along with having her \u0026pound40,000 legal costs paid from the defendant’s smaller share.  But that was all lost when the property exploded. Mr Peet said the defendant had been a “vexatious litigant” with repeated appeal applications against the sale of the house, after Ms Williams moved out with their children to start a new life. Three petrol cans capable of holding 25 litres, 20 litres and five litres were taken into the property. Fuel was later identified in 27 areas. Mr Peet said: “There was a petrol trail around the ground floor, up the stairs and the loft hatch was left open, no doubt deliberately so it would blow the roof off.”  Mr Peet added: “The explosion left a shell requiring demolition on just a plot of land. “It’s probably worth nil because of the mortgage. “He’s defeated any claim she may have had on the property.” Of Duffy’s mental state, Mr Peet said: “He wasn’t unstable through mental illness, he was perfectly stable, perfectly rational.” Judge Stokes said: “This was a very grave offence. “It wasn’t simply a fire lit in frustration that the fire brigade were able to put out. “It was a carefully planned episode where you wanted to do as much damage as you possibly could.  “Your motivation was revenge against your former partner. “Although you were the legal owner of the property, the (county) court decided she had the majority equitable interest in this property. “You were upset about that and sought permission to appeal.  “That permission was refused and you took it to the Court of Appeal and appropriately, for the same reasons, the judges declined your application for permission to appeal and comments were made that the time had come for you to comply with the order of the court.  “A purchaser had been found and you remained in the property. “You refused to leave it, resulting in an application to the court to have you removed from the property.  “Before the court officers could put that into effect, you chose, in a carefully planned endeavour, to destroy the property. “It wasn’t just a spur-of-the moment offence, borne of frustration, but deliberately and carefully planned. “The object being to destroy the property and impoverishing your ex-partner, who also had the benefit of a \u0026pound40,000 costs award against you. “You allowed the buildings insurance to lapse. “You placed those petrol cans inside the property and caused an ignition. “There was an explosion, you say it caused you to be thrown outside the property. “The house was completely and utterly destroyed, as evidenced by photographs. The judge added: “Given your mitigation, I understand relationships that break down can cause immense emotional strain on individuals.” "},{"url":null,"title":"everyday item clothing kate meghan","story":"NewsEveryday item of clothing Kate and Meghan can\u0027t wear in front of the Queen - even though they love themKate Middleton has been photographed wearing them on several occasions, but she can\u0027t wear them to events the Queen will be at\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer16:40, 18 MAY 2018Updated17:45, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKate Middleton and Meghan Markle have very different styles when it comes to fashion.

Bronte Howard says her massive debt is already more than the mortgage her grandparents took out on their three-bedroom home in the 1970s.  And the amount will continue to rise each year due to interest.  The Wales Online reporter discovered she owes \u0026pound53,409.20 after checking her student loan statement for the first time this week.  She says MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis told her to rip up the statement, saying it\u0027s totally irrelevant and shouldn\u0027t be sent.  But she questions whether it is as simple as that. Below, Bronte writes of her shock and the advice she has been given.   Her words first appeared on Wales Online .   I’m 22 years old and I already have a massive debt hanging over me. It’s more than the mortgage my grandparents took out when they bought their three-bed house back in the 70s. I’m not a frivolous shopper, I don’t have gambling debts and it isn’t from buying property. It’s the price I - and millions of others - have paid to continue studying since tuition fees were first introduced in 1998. For those of you who were lucky enough to be able to borrow from Student Finance Wales (which I believe has a slightly better system where the Welsh Government contributes towards tuition fees, meaning students only pay \u0026pound3,000 a year) or were able to pay the fees without needing to take out loans, I’ll briefly explain how the English system worked when I took out my loans in 2013 and 2016.  I paid \u0026pound9,000 a year to study a bachelor\u0027s degree in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Sheffield. This cost me \u0026pound27,000, which I borrowed. I was also given money in the form of loans (which I have to pay back), grants and bursaries to cover things like rent, food and books. I think in total I had around \u0026pound8,000 a year to spend. Some students studying now are even worse off after the Government scrapped grants and introduced a second loan for students whose parents are on a low income. But after added interest, which started being added to the already hefty bill in April 2017, I currently owe \u0026pound42,711.43 for my undergraduate degree - a lot more than my Welsh friends. I then decided to do a master’s degree in journalism at Cardiff University so I took out a \u0026pound10,000 from Student Finance England and it barely covered my tuition fees. So I actually ended up with overdraft debt and had to rely on my parents (thanks mum and dad) and savings.  At the time, Student Finance Wales didn’t offer a postgraduate loan, so in a way, I was better off than some of my coursemates. (Although now Welsh postgraduate students are entitled to borrow up to \u0026pound13,000). I start to pay this back when I earn \u0026pound25,000 and what I pay is based on how much I earn, not how much I borrowed. But after four years of university, I now have a debt that, unless I win the lottery, I doubt I will ever fully pay back. I didn’t really think about how much I owed and I didn’t know the exact figure until a few days ago when I checked my statement online. I’d almost forgotten that I owed money because it’s almost an invisible debt. I thought it would be somewhere in the region of \u0026pound40,000 because naively, I didn’t really understand interest rates when I took out the loan at 18. It’s actually \u0026pound53,409.20 and will continue to go up each year when interest is added.   The interest rate for my postgraduate loan has also been increased to 6.1%, which is higher than the interest rate for a lot of mortgages and is probably going to go up again. So, after seeing the huge figure I asked finance expert and MoneySavingExpert\u0027s Martin what I should do. After all, it’s a huge amount of money but it doesn’t seem like anybody really cares.

A white British teenager, dressed in a sari, injured, distressed, her body covered in cuts and bruises. She had been dumped on the Pennine moors in the middle of the night and told to walk home.  Distraught and terrified, she instead made for the Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team’s office to wait for Sara Rowbotham to arrive at work. That was just one harrowing memory from Sara’s 10 years as an NHS sexual health worker in the town where she uncovered evidence of horrific sex abuse being perpetrated against dozens of girls by older Asian men. Her hard work won Sara and her team a Special Recognition honour at the NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror, which will be screened on Monday.  The Rochdale abuse scandal shone a light on other towns and cities and helped expose other child grooming rings in Telford and Aylesbury. But while Sara is pleased victims are now taken seriously, she says still more needs to be done. She says: “I think every area in the country now has a strategy, a procedure, a dedicated team, so lots of investment has been put into this. Everyone is more aware. “But at the same time I saw a story in the local paper a few months ago where a 12-year-old girl was walking down the street in a state of distress. “Some people came out to make sure she was okay – she was upset because her boyfriend had finished with her. But her boyfriend was 25 and he had groomed her online. So it hasn’t stopped, has it? And the prevention techniques that have been used haven’t stopped that 12-year-old from becoming involved with that perpetrator.”  Tackling the predators should be the main priority, she says. “All they ever talk about is making children and young women resilient to the pressures. They don’t talk about why the hell aren’t we making these men pack it in? “What are we doing to change their attitude and stop their behaviour? Where is the prevention around that? “I don’t think long sentences are deterrent enough. We are still in an environment where predatory men are seeking out children.” For years, Sara and her team banged on the doors of police and social services trying to get help for the girls and action against the men who preyed on them. In 2012, nine men were finally convicted for grooming young girls after an investigation had found more than 40 girls across Rochdale had been targeted and groomed at takeaways in the area.  Some girls were raped by several men, one after another, or taken in taxis to locations across the North of England, plied with drugs and alcohol, and raped. Some of the girls got pregnant. One, aged just 13, had an abortion. Fighting back tears, Sara says: “Those girls had so much potential. What makes me so upset is that I watched them deteriorate because of the terrible abuse they suffered. They could have achieved whatever they wanted, but they didn’t. “Now some of them have substance addictions, severe mental health problems, have had their own children taken into care. What happened to them impacted on their entire futures.” Sara, now 51, had set up the Crisis Intervention Team in 2003, and very quickly realised that Rochdale had a problem with child sexual exploitation. She says: “The first girl who was referred to the team was described as performing sex acts for free to year 10 boys in school hours. “By the time she was about 14 she started to make disclosures about situations she was involved in, like going to parties, taking other girls, getting really drunk, having sex with multiple people at parties, sometimes she would be given money, sometimes she wouldn’t.  “That group of girls got bigger and we were concerned about all of them. “But then, completely separate to that, we met another group of girls who started to say similar names of men. We started to piece things together. It was very rare that a young person would come in and say they had been sexually assaulted or exploited.” The BBC drama, Three Girls, showed how Sara, who was played by Maxine Peake, and her team compiled lists of names, and started to flag up their concerns to police and social services. But their reports fell on deaf ears, as shown in the drama, which also starred Liv Hill, Lisa Riley and Molly Windsor, who won the Leading Actress TV BAFTA last Sunday for her portrayal of one victim. Sara made more than 180 referrals to police and social services, but little or no action was taken. She says: “It just became a case of batting the ball back and forwards. Sometimes social services would do an initial assessment and that was it, sometimes the police would take information for intelligence, but that was it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"james hewitt prince harry rumours","story":"NewsThe truth behind THOSE James Hewitt rumours as they resurface ahead of Prince Harry\u0027s weddingRumours that James Hewitt fathered Prince Harry during his affair with Princess Diana have persisted for decades - here\u0027s what he\u0027s had to say\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRoss Logan20:21, 18 MAY 2018Updated23:42, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to US actress Meghan Markle dominating the news, the scurrilous rumours about his parentage have surfaced once again. Dozens of social media users each day have pointed out the similarity behind ginger Prince Harry and his late mum\u0027s one-time lover, Major James Hewitt. Mr Hewitt prefers to keep out of the public eye nowadays, but has spoken out twice in the past to categorically deny being the real father of Prince Harry. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Harry\u0027s father. Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not.  Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

It was thought Thomas Markle c ould receive his own family coat of arms as a special wedding gift . While Kensington Palace and the College of Arms declined to comment on the present, courtiers said it is a tradition unlikely not to be followed. The fathers of the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, the Duchess of Wessex, both received the gift when their daughters married into the royal family.  However the decision means Meghan\u0027s relations, who have been outspoken in the lead up to the royal wedding , will not be able to boast their own coat of arms, according to the Daily Mail . A source at the College of Arms told the newspaper: Mr Markle will not have his own coat of arms. We were told it would be too \u0027complicated\u0027.  Instead, the Mail claims Meghan will be given her own coat of arms, following the example of the Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte van Deurs, who married the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, in 1972. For anyone to be given the distinctive heraldic bearing, they need to prove they have an ancestor who was a subject of the Crown. Mr Markle\u0027s ancestors include Mary Smith, a maid who was recorded in 1856 as working at Windsor Castle, where Meghan will be married in May.  After the family receive their coat of arms, Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry, 33, can get their own “conjugal coat of arms.  They are likely to be officially unveiled a few years after they marry. William and Kate’s made its debut in September 2013, just over two years after their April 2011 wedding.

Kensington Palace revealed last month that hundreds of schoolkids would be invited to tomorrow’s wedding. But there was no reason for all the others to miss out on the party. And as wedding fever swept playgrounds today, one school got into the spirit big-time with a performance by their very own “Harry and Meghan”. Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both 10, played the happy couple in Fleetwood, Lancs.  They arrived at church in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by two residents of a nearby care home, who played Prince Philip and the Queen. The youngsters walked down the aisle before being showered with confetti by flag-waving pals from Flakefleet Primary. The mock wedding was intended to teach the children about being proud to be British.  Thousands of pounds were donated in the form of dresses, crowns, suits, bunting, flags and flowers in an event that captured the heart and imagination of the community. Headteacher Dave McPartlin said the event started as a way of creating memories for the children. But it snowballed after sharing videos of a mini-Meghan and Harry on their first date, on their hen and stag dos on social media. Mr McPartlin said: “It exceeded all of our expectations. It went absolutely to plan and the children had a fantastic time. They made memories that they’ll never forget.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum meet maam how meghan","story":"NewsMum, meet Ma\u0027am: How Meghan Markle\u0027s “free-spirited” yoga teacher mum went from humble beginnings to tea with the QueenMeghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland beamed with happiness as they arrived at luxury Cliveden House Hotel to spend the night before the royal wedding together\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachael Bletchly21:37, 18 MAY 2018Updated22:22, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey swept up the long drive in a royal Range Rover with armed bodyguards following in the car behind. Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland beamed with happiness as they arrived at luxury Cliveden House Hotel to spend the night before the royal wedding together. A relaxed Meghan told fans outside she was feeling “wonderful”. And while the proud mother-of-the bride also looked composed, she must have been pinching herself after three whirlwind days that took her from her modest Los Angeles home to the \u0026shygrandeur of Windsor Castle. Doria, 61, a “free-spirited” yoga teacher and social worker had just had tea with the Queen – her future son-in-law’s granny – and Prince Philip.  On Wednesday she met Charles and Camilla at Clarence House before spending some time with William, Kate and children George, Charlotte and Louis. Tomorrow she will watch her only child Meghan, whom she calls “Flower”, marry a prince and become Her Royal \u0026shyHighness. It’s been a fairy tale ride for the mum and daughter who are so close they call themselves “best friends”. And tonight Doria has her daughter to herself one last time. Wearing a cream dress and black jacket with her dreadlocked hair tied back with a scarf, Doria waved to photographers as Cliveden House managers greeted them. Meghan, wearing a \u0026pound1,350 navy Roland Mouret Barwick dress, told waiting royal fans that she felt “wonderful, thank you”.  The pair were accompanied by a small team of trusted helpers who will prepare the bride for her appearance in front of a global television audience of millions this morning. The pair are staying in a wing of the hotel and a small marquee has been erected over the entrance. Rooms there cost upwards of \u0026pound400 a night. As they arrived at the hotel, it was clear mother and daughter share a unique bond that will survive Meghan’s royal transformation. Harry’s mum had a fragile relationship with her own mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, who walked out on her family when Diana was just eight. But after Meghan’s parents split, when she was six, she grew even closer to her African-American mum, becoming kindred spirits. And their relationship was further strengthened by the vile race hate they faced in 1980s Los Angeles. Doria was born there, to an antique dealer father and a mother who was a nurse.  Her great-great-great grandfather was born into slavery and freed at the end of the Civil War in 1865 when he chose the surname “Wisdom”. Doria went to Fairfax High School, where she was remembered as the bright, friendly teenager with the Afro \u0026shyhairstyle who loved listening to Marvin Gaye and eating at a Mexican taco joint with pals. She began working as a make-up artist in \u0026shyHollywood where she met lighting director Thomas Markle. They wed in 1979 and Meghan was born two years later. The family moved into a house in The Valley, LA. But, talking about her background a year before she met Harry, Meghan revealed Doria was regularly mistaken for the hired help. “The neighbourhood was leafy and affordable,” Meghan said.    “What it was not, however, was diverse. And there was my mom, caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny.” When the couple divorced in 1987 Doria took a job as an air stewardess, meaning Meghan was frequently cared for by her father, whom she clearly still adores. Doria later returned to university and got a masters degree in social work after a BA in psychology. In 2003 the royal bride-to-be got her own degree in theatre and international studies. Doria also fostered Meghan’s social conscience – taking her to visit \u0026shydisadvantaged children in Rwanda, see the slums of Jamaica and experience poverty in Mexico when she was just 10. Harry has already grown close to his fun-loving future mother in law. Last September he flew Doria to Canada to join them at the Invictus Games – where he and Meghan made their love public – and was seen laughing with her at the closing ceremony.  He describes Doria as “amazing” and looks set to hit the dance floor with her at their evening reception. For in a post on her former lifestyle blog The Tig in 2014, Meghan summed up her mum’s personality. “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. “If the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it, she will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance... swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. “And you will smile. You won’t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy.” Tomorrow Doria will be the one smiling with joy as she drives to St George’s Chapel, Windsor, in another grand royal car with Meghan. And she will be tapping her foot as a gospel choir sings Ben E King’s hit Stand By Me during the unconventional royal wedding ceremony. Doria will continue to stand by Meghan as she begins her new life. But their special bond means Her Royal Highness will always be “Flower” to her mum.

Wouldn’t it have been wonderful to see Doria Ragland walk her daughter down the aisle of St George’s Chapel? A show of strong solidarity. After all Queen Victoria escorted two of her daughters.  But I am not surprised it’s not the case. I can almost see courtiers frowning at the thought – because that isn’t protocol, that’s not how it is done. Meghan will have to get used to this grinding of the Royal Protocol Machine. Diana knew only too well you can’t fight them. She would have told Meghan, “You can’t win everything. You have to roll with it.”  But it won’t be Charles walking her down the aisle alone. I expect to see a white rose in tribute to Diana in her bouquet. And so Diana will be right there with Meghan too.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself. Yesterday she drove to her wedding rehearsal in \u0026pound7,000 diamond earrings, and how many of those would it take for YOU to be happy as the junior partner in YOUR marriage?

Gospel group The Kingdom Choir will perform the singer’s Stand By Me, along with Etta James’s version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine. And the couple’s modern spin on a royal wedding also takes in very contemporary vows. Meghan will not promise to “obey” when she marries her prince today at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, and the couple will be pronounced as “husband and wife” rather than “man and wife”. They will also refer to each other as “Harry” and “Meghan” as they say their vows, using the names they are known by rather than their given names – and not including middle or surnames. However, there will still be nods to royal tradition, with classical pieces being played while their 600 guests are taking their seats and a rendition of the national anthem at the end.  And there is a poignant tribute to Harry’s tragic mum Princess Diana with the inclusion of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – which was played at her 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included the hymn at their 2011 wedding. A spokesman said Harry and Meghan have “taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service”. He added: “This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle. They have also sought the advice of the Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the service begins.” The five organ pieces and seven orchestral pieces that will be played as guests arrive include Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on Greensleeves, which William and Kate also chose for their big day.  The orchestra, made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia, will also play pieces by Elgar and Holst. The bride will arrive to a fanfare from the trumpeters of the Household Cavalry then walk down the aisle – where she will be met halfway by Prince Charles – to the sound of Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine. An order of service to be given to the 600 guests has an introduction taken from Common Worship, which reads: “A wedding is one of life’s great moments, a time of solemn commitment as well as good wishes, feasting and joy.  “Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children.” The 20-page service was printed before the couple knew Meghan’s dad Thomas would not be able to attend, so his name is included in the order.   The service they have chosen is from the Marriage Service from Common Worship and features contemporary language – using the word “you” instead of “thee” and “thou”, and offering the most flexibility in the choice of readings and prayers. While the couple are signing the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will perform three pieces with the orchestra. Recent royal tradition has been for brides not to pledge to obey their husbands. Kate did not in 2011 and neither did Diana in 1981 when she married Charles. But the Queen and her sister Margaret did, as did the Countess of Wessex in 1999. Harry and Meghan wanted Diana’s family to play a role so her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will deliver a reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love. The service will be led by the Right Reverend David Conner, Dean of Windsor, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will officiate as the couple say their vows.  They will also greet the Royal Family as they arrive at the Galilee Porch from 11.25am. Harry and best man William will arrive at 11.40am and greet charity guests outside before entering the chapel as the congregation stands. The Queen is the last to arrive before the bride and will be taken to her seat in the Quire. The chapel was closed to the public yesterday as last-minute preparations were made. London florist Philippa Craddock and her team were decorating the chapel with white roses, foxgloves and Meghan’s favourite peonies, as well as branches of birch, beech and hornbeam. Meanwhile, Windsor town centre was teaming with tourists and fans of the royals waving flags, many preparing to sleep out on the streets to get the best spots for the big day.  Barriers were in place along the procession route with crowds of up to 100,000 expected. Some 5,000 media workers from around the world will broadcast the celebrations to an estimated billion-strong audience. And police were creating a “ring of steel” around Windsor Castle in one of Thames Valley’s biggest operations to date. Armed officers and sniffer dogs have been patrolling the area. Metal barriers have been put up in the Berkshire town to prevent potential attackers from using vehicles, as in the terrorist atrocities committed on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge in the capital.  Police have even asked people not to throw confetti, tweeting: “Please do not throw confetti or any other items at any time during the day, particularly during the procession. “It poses a potential security risk and it’s a bit of a pain to clean up! We hope everyone enjoys the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding day 2018 live","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding Day 2018: Live updates as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle prepare to finally tie the knotThe couple are just hours away from the biggest day of their lives and hardcore fans are already out in force to welcome the newlyweds\u0026nbspShareByNatalie EvansUpdated05:29, 19 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now The day has finally arrived when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot.

A statement from Kensington Palace said the couple had taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service.

The preface The Dean of Windsor reads: “In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,we have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan, to pray for God’s blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. “Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. “Marriage is a way of life made holy by God and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community. “No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. “Harry and Meghan are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. “We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God’s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together. All stand. Hymn: Lord of all Hopefulness Lord of all Hopefulness, Lord of all joy, Whose trust, ever child-like, no cares could destroy, Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray, Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe, Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray, Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. Jan Struther (1901–53) ‘Slane’, Traditional Irish Melody Declarations All remain standing as the Archbishop leads the Declarations: “First, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the couple: “The vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: “Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?” He answers: “I will.” The Archbishop says to the bride: “Meghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? She answers: “I will”. The Archbishop says to the congregation: “Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?” All answer: “We will”. The collect THE Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he says the Collect: “God our Father, from the beginning you have blessed creation with abundant life. “Pour out your blessings upon Harry and Meghan, that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship, in holiness and commitment to each other. “We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. All sit. Reading From the Song of Solomon, read by The Lady Jane Fellowes from the Nave. “My beloved speaks and says to me: ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. “The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance. “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. “Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. “If one offered for love all the wealth of one’s house, it would be utterly scorned.” If Ye Love Me All remain seated while the Choir of St George’s Chapel sing the Motet, If Ye Love Me. IF ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may ‘bide with you forever, e’en the spirit of truth.

Jerry Leiber (1933–2011), Ben E King (1938–2015) and Mike Stroller (b. 1933) arr. by Mark Delisser (b. 1973) When the night has come, And the land is dark, And the moon is the only light we see. No, I won’t be afraid. Oh, I won’t be afraid, Just as long as you stand, stand by me. So darling, darling, stand by me, Oh, stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me. If the sky that we look upon, Should tumble and fall, Or the mountain should crumble to the sea. I won’t cry, I won’t cry. No, I won’t shed a tear. Just as long as you stand, stand by me, Darling, darling, stand by me... Whenever you’re in trouble, Won’t you stand by me, oh stand by me. Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me. The vows All remain seated as the Archbishop leads the vows: Harry and Meghan, I now invite you to join hands and make your vows, in the presence of God and his people. The Bride and Bridegroom face each other and join hands. The \u0026shyBridegroom says: I Harry, take you, Meghan, to be my wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part according to God’s holy law.

The rings The Archbishop says: Heavenly Father, by your blessing let these rings be to Harry and Meghan a symbol of unending love and \u0026shyfaithfulness, to remind them of the vow and covenant which they have made this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Bridegroom places ring on the fourth finger of the Bride’s left hand and, holding it there, says: Meghan, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage. With my body I honour you, all that I am I give to you, and all that I have I share with you, within the love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They loose hands and the Bride places a ring on fourth finger of Bridegroom’s left hand and, holding it there, says: Harry, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage. With my body I honour you, all that I am I give to you, and all that I have I share with you, within the love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Proclamation The Archbishop addresses the people: In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other. They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I \u0026shytherefore proclaim that they are husband and wife. The Archbishop joins their right hands together and says: Those whom God has joined together let no one put asunder.

Amen. John Rutter (b. 1945) Blessing of the marriage The Archbishop says: Blessed are you, O Lord our God, for you have created joy and gladness, pleasure and delight, love, peace and fellowship.

Amen. All sit or kneel. The prayers Led by Archbishop Angaelos and The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin from the Nave: Faithful God, holy and eternal, source of life and spring of love, we thank and praise you for bringing Harry and Meghan to this day, and we pray for them. Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. May their marriage be life-giving and life-long, enriched by your presence and strengthened by your grace may they bring comfort and confidence to each other in faithfulness and trust.

Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. May they nurture their family with devotion, see their children grow in body, mind and spirit and come at last to the end of their lives with hearts content and in joyful anticipation of heaven.

Lord\u0027s prayer Let us pray with confidence as our Saviour has taught us: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and for ever. Amen. All stand. Hymn: Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer Guide me, O thou great Redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land I am weak, but thou art mighty, Hold me with thy powerful hand: Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more. Open now the crystal fountain Whence the healing stream doth flow Let the fire and cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through: Strong deliverer, Be thou still my strength and shield.

Harry and the Suits actress will tie the knot tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by friends and family. Lucky members of the general public have also been selected to be part of the celebrations, one of the most talked about events of 2018. But who will be part of the royal wedding party? Here are the people who have been chosen to have an important role...   Will William be the best man? Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his best man at his wedding. William is honoured to have been asked and is looking forward to being by his brother\u0027s side. In a statement last month, Kensington Palace said: Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle . The Duke of Cambridge is honoured to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor on May 19. Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.  Prince William, who is President of the Football Association, will miss the 2018 FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s special day. Prince Harry was also best man to his brother when Prince William married Kate Middleton back in 2011. The brothers are close and William was always the obvious choice, but it was not officially confirmed until April 26. Strictly speaking, royals have a supporter rather than a best man, but the brothers appear to have broken this tradition.  Who will give Meghan away? Meghan\u0027s dad will not attend the wedding after suffering a heart scare following a row over staged paparazzi photos.  Thomas Markle, 73, was initially planning to fly to London from his home near Rosarito, Mexico, to perform the honour at his daughter\u0027s wedding. But the axe fell on this plan, with Meghan announcing: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to than everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.  It was later announced Prince Charles would give Meghan away.  She will walk the first part of the aisle with her six bridesmaids and four pageboys before meeting Charles for the rest of the way to the altar.  A statement from Kensington Palace read: Ms. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day. The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way.  Meghan\u0027s mum - Doria Ragland Feminist Meghan has been keen to involve her mother in the proceedings. She will travel past crowds to the church by car with Doria Ragland , and the bride-to-be is said to be delighted. On Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ . She flew to Heathrow in London before engaging on a whirlwind of royal engagements.  These included meals with Charles and Camilla William, Kate, George and Charlotte and an audience with the Queen at Windsor Castle.   Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. Meghan has previously opened up about her mum, crediting her with being one of the actress\u0027s biggest influences in life. She told Glamour magazine: We can just have so much fun together, and yet, I\u0027ll still find so much solace in her support. That duality coexists the same way it would in a best friend.  Bridesmaids It has been announced that Meghan will not have a maid of honour by her side on the big day. She\u0027s actually decided not to have any of her friends in her wedding party at all, and she\u0027s not having any grown-up bridesmaids. However she will be having children bridesmaids, and Prince Harry\u0027s niece Princess Charlotte will be among them.  Her other bridesmaids are: - Florence van Cutsem , three, who is Prince Harry’s goddaughter, and the daughter of his long-standing family friend Major Nicholas van Cutsem and Alice van Cutsem. - Remi Litt, the six-year-old daughter of Meghan’s close friend Benita Litt and her husband Darren Litt. - Rylan Litt, Meghan’s other goddaughter, seven, and Benita Litt’s oldest child. - Ivy Mulroney, the four-year-old youngest child of Meghan’s stylist and best friend Jessica Mulroney. - Zalie Warren, the youngest of the bridesmaids at just two years old. She is another of Harry’s goddaughters and the daughter of one of his best friends, Jake Warren and Mr Warren’s wife Zoe.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said she simply couldn\u0027t decide which of her friends to pick adding She has a very close knit group of friends and did not want to choose one over the other. There was a lot of speculation about who would take up the royal on Meghan\u0027s big day and lots of names have been thrown around in the last few months. Many believed the honour would go to best pal Lindsay Roth, as Meghan was her maid of honour when she married British accountant Gavin Jordan a few years back.  Page boys Of course Prince George, four, will be a page boy. He will be joined by Jasper Dyer, six, a godson of Harry’s and the son of his trusted mentor Mark Dyer and Mr Dyer’s wife Amanda. Former Welsh Guards office Mr Dyer has been a key father figure to the prince since childhood. Also on the list of page boys are Brian and John Mulroney , the seven-year-old fraternal twin sons of Jessica and Ben Mulroney - and older siblings to Ivy Mulroney.  Prince George and Princess Charlotte Prince George and Princess Charlotte already have one page boy and flower girl gig on their CVs - for their aunt Pippa Middleton on her wedding day last May. George did have a bit of a moment, in tears after the ceremony and with a telling off from mum Kate, but he and his little sister are now set to be page boy and flower girl for Meghan.  Princess Diana\u0027s sister - Lady Jayne Fellowes There is one person Prince Harry will probably be thinking about a lot as he prepares to say his vows - his mum. The royal couple have explained exactly how they will celebrate the memory of the late Princess Diana on their special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jayne Fellowes will give a reading during the ceremony.

And for those of you who won’t be at Harry and Meghan’s big bash, our itinerary takes in every special moment so you can feel as though you are. From early sightings of guests arriving and the first glimpses of the prince and his bride all the way through to their carriage ride as newlyweds, you can follow the day’s strict timetable. While toasting their health and happiness with some bubbly, naturally. 9AM Like Charlie’s arrival at the Chocolate Factory, there will be a frenzy as the lucky recipients of Harry and Meghan’s ‘golden tickets’ begin to gather inside the grounds of the 15th century Windsor Castle for their special ringside seats.  These 1,200 members of the public, specially selected because of their community work, or their triumph over adversity, include representatives of Harry’s charities. They will be joined by 200 schoolchildren as well as 1,240 members of the royal household. Although they are golden invites, they don’t quite get these guests all the way to the promised land. But no doubt they will be dolled up in their wedding finery and happy to witness Harry and Meghan’s big day from outside the Chapel’s walls. 9.30am to 11am It’s an early start for the 600 guests, who will begin to arrive at the castle’s Round Tower at 9.30am – so they will have begun preening at the crack of dawn to look their best for the cameras. Guests, rumoured to include the Beckhams and tennis star Serena Williams, will have first met at the Windsor Farm Shop, founded by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2001, where they will have security checks and show IDs.  They will then be put on coaches to go to St George’s Chapel, where they will enter through the South Door. They have been asked not to bring phones and bulky bags – or carry swords! The guest list is smaller than the 1,900 at Westminster Abbey for William and Kate’s big day in 2011. No doubt Harry and Meghan felt they would enjoy a more intimate occasion. Harry’s good pals Barack and Michelle Obama were not invited. It is thought the awkward etiquette of inviting them and not President Trump was behind the decision.  11.20am The royals begin to arrive, some by foot and others by car – expect Rolls-Royces and Bentleys – and will enter by the Galilee Porch. Stand by to gossip about Beatrice and Eugenie’s fashion choices, especially their headgear.  It is also hoped Prince Philip will be able to attend after his recent hip operation. Protocol decrees the Queen is the last guest to arrive, just before the bride herself. Prince Edward married Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in St George’s Chapel in June 1999. And Harry was christened there in 1984.    11.45AM Brace yourself for whoops and applause as Harry and brother Prince William, his best man, arrive on foot at the chapel’s West Steps, purposefully striding past the hordes invited into the castle grounds. At this stage Harry will have the chance to welcome his charity representatives, gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps.  No doubt his usual cheeky grin will belie a few nerves. William will possibly be relieved not to be centre stage this time round, but perhaps a little nervous about delivering his best man’s speech. Harry memorably called him ‘the dude’ in his own best man’s speech on William and Kate’s big day. Hopefully William returns the compliment. Harry’s long-term pals, ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, will welcome them inside.  11.55AM This is the Queen’s moment to arrive at the castle, just minutes before Meghan. There will be the usual jostle to see Her Majesty.  Always stunning in bright outfits, she is likely to be applauded nearly as loudly as the bride. 11.59AM Expect a roar to raise the castle turrets as Ms Markle arrives at the castle’s West Steps with her bridesmaids and pageboys. She will have already journeyed with her mother Doria Ragland along the historic Long Walk, to the delight of crowds glued to its fringes.  When the car stops at the castle Meghan will be joined by her bridesmaids and pageboys before she enters the chapel via the Galilee Porch. Meghan will be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles after her own father, Thomas, was unable to be there after having heart surgery. The bridesmaids and pageboys will include Prince George and Princess Charlotte, plus Ivy Mulroney, four, the daughter of Meghan’s best friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney. 12-1PM St George’s Chapel will gently descend into quiet as the service finally begins. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple. The Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service.  The sermon is due to be delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, 65, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church.  The newly married couple will emerge afterwards on the West Steps, before they set off on their carriage procession through Windsor. 1.05PM The newlyweds may conduct a mini-walkabout with charity representatives before their open-top carriage moves past the crowds, waved off by close family on the chapel’s West Steps.  The procession will then travel along Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and Long Walk for 25 minutes, before it returns to the castle where they will join their guests for the lunch reception at 1.30pm.  3.30PM The lunch and speeches at St George’s Hall are set to end, although 200 guests will remain at the castle to relax and refresh before the second, more intimate, reception hosted by Prince Charles at 7pm for close friends and family. The selection of the evening guests has not been without controversy with Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, reportedly upset not to be included. Even Pippa Middleton failed to get an invite, it is said. 7PM The evening reception will be hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House in the castle grounds.  You could spot Harry and Meghan leave to travel for dinner.

Newbury, in Berkshire, is home to Vodafone’s headquarters and has a higher ‘digital density’ than anywhere else in the UK, as companies seek to expand beyond London. It topped the list ahead of Reading, Basingstoke and Burnley as smaller towns build up skilled workforces to nurture new startups and tech companies. A new tech report described the ‘productivity power path’ travelling along the M4 corridor and spreading to Southampton and Portsmouth. Gerard Grech, chief executive and co-founder of Tech Nation, which compiled the 2018 report said: “This is the first major milestone of Tech Nation, the organisation now working across the country to build networks that support ambitious entrepreneurs and shine a light on the achievements of our tech sector.  “London is the world’s second most connected hub after Silicon Valley. We need to make the most of that, as our new relationship with the EU will undoubtedly force us to be even more adaptive, innovative and ambitious.” As well as the tech towns, eight cities also showed above-average employment in the technology field, with Portsmouth topping the list. It was followed by Bristol, Cambridge, Southampton and Oxford rounding out the top five. The Tech Nation report shows the UK’s digital tech sector is accelerating faster than the rest of the economy. In fact, the sector’s growth from a \u0026pound170bn industry in 2016 to \u0026pound184bn in the most recent report shows that it’s expanding two-and-a-half times faster than the rest of the UK’s economy. It also revealed the digital tech sector’s workforce is both older, and more ethnically diverse, than the average UK workplace. It showed 72 per cent of UK digital tech workers are over 35, challenging the stereotype that jobs in the sector are usually taken by millennials.

Among one of the first stores in the country to take part in the trial is Tesco Extra in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. It means shoppers\u0027 faces now appear on screens above each checkout at the store. A warning in each bagging area states: CCTV recording in operation for the protection of customers, staff and stock. Similar security measures have already been brought in at hundreds of Sainsbury\u0027s stores across the country in a crackdown on shoplifters using self-service tills. Tesco customers have today slammed the extra security.  Mother-of-five Vicky Morrell, aged 38, from Bentilee, told the Stoke Sentinel : I come to Tesco once a week for bits and bobs.    Mothercare closes 50 stores with hundreds of jobs at risk in rescue plan to save as it rehires boss ailing firm sacked 36 days ago  But I don\u0027t use the self-service tills if I can help it because I don\u0027t like them. It seems like something goes wrong with them all the time and that\u0027s quite frustrating. The new CCTV cameras could be dangerous, especially if you are using bank cards and if you have kids as well because you don\u0027t know who is behind the screen watching it. It\u0027s a bit much for me. I can respect the reason for them bringing it in but there are alarms and they could do random checks. I would be much more comfortable with that than seeing yourself on a screen. But if you haven\u0027t done anything wrong you haven\u0027t got anything to hide.

The 51-year-old said he does not blame his half-sister for getting caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle and falling out of touch. In an exclusive interview, Thomas Jnr claims the pair will always be close at heart in a normal extended family that has been pulled in different directions. And he says his father, unable to attend the wedding due to ill health, would be overjoyed Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Ever since it started with Meg dating Prince Harry it has been a media storm nightmare for me and my entire family, Thomas Jnr told . It puts you in a different mind frame and puts a lot of stress, that you don\u0027t even realise, on you. Being photographed and followed, with your private life turned upside down, it\u0027s hard on everybody. So things get done out of frustration and you look back and you know you made a mistake.   Follow our royal wedding countdown live updates here.                The mistake Thomas Jnr refers to is an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry two weeks ago in which he advised the royal to call off his wedding. You feel like an ass about it, the dad-of-two confessed. But my true feelings are that I couldn\u0027t be happier for her. What are the odds. This is every woman\u0027s dream come true - to marry a prince. I couldn\u0027t be more happy for or proud of my sister. She\u0027s incredible. Thomas Jnr, who is in London ahead of the wedding to offer support for his sister, said his fondest memories of Meghan were actually formed during a difficult time for the Markle family. He told how caring and kind she was in the two years that followed their gran Doris\u0027 dementia diagnosis in 2009.  My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two year\u0027s prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time, he said. She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree. It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special. Thomas Jnr also addressed former claims Meghan abandoned her father and forgot about the family when she moved to Canada to play Rachel Zane in legal drama Suits.    When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role, Thomas Jnr said. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, alway from your family and away from contact. And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart. If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phonecall. We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA. Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family. Thomas Jnr and Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle Snr, had surgery on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack. The retired lighting engineer is reported to be awake and alert but will remain in hospital while he recovers.  This afternoon, Kensington Palace confirmed Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, will walk Meghan to the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor. I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there, Thomas Jnr said. As far as tradition goes, he is he obvious choice. And referring to Meghan\u0027s pre-wedding jitters, Thomas Jnr said she\u0027ll be brave no matter what. The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way, he said. It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it. I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters. Being divorced means nothing, I mean, this is the relationship in her life that counts and matters the most. So, this dress will be outstanding. She\u0027s very confident in everything she does. I think she\u0027s going to be nervous, it\u0027s the biggest day of her life. This is the one that she\u0027ll never forget. She\u0027ll be brave no matter what - she\u0027s got that down.  Thomas Jnr, who this week visited St George\u0027s Chapel and Windsor Castle, is remaining tight-lipped about his plans for the big day. But wherever he ends up, he says he will be celebrating. I wish them all the happiness in the world, he said. When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children. She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time.

All are coping with the devastating psychological impact. And while it was music that brought them together in the worst moment of their lives, on the first anniversary of the atrocity, music is helping them heal. Parents and children who were at the Ariana Grande concert, targeted by bomber Salman Abedi, formed the Manchester Survivors Choir, meeting twice a month in a church near the Arena to sing, talk, laugh and cry together. Yasmin Lee, 13, from Stockport, who suffered shrapnel injuries, says: “We were in the foyer when the bomb went off. I was blown over by the force. “It didn’t hit me until we got outside that I was injured. I rang my mum to tell her I was OK and I suddenly felt my leg burning. Shrapnel had gone through the back of my right calf. So I had to have a skin graft and was in hospital for a week.  “I didn’t process what had happened for months. It was coming up to Christmas that I realised I needed help. I’m still having counselling now. “But I’ve made friendships at the choir that I know I will have for ever. If you have had a bad week everyone understands and gives you support.” It’s that sentiment which inspired fellow victims Cath Hill, 45, and Carys Crow, 18, to start the choir. They met on a survivors’ WhatsApp group set up by the police after the attack, which killed 22 people and left hundreds more physically or psychologically injured. Cath, from Lancaster, who had taken her 10-year-old son Jake to his first concert, says: “We left from a different exit, so we did not experience seeing people dead or in great distress. But everyone was screaming and we really did think another attack was imminent.”  Weeks later they were caught up in a second terrorist incident in Cambrils in Spain. Cath says: “Jake has had nightmares, shaky legs, worrying about busy spaces. Time has helped, meeting others who were there has all helped. “We are coming together to support each other and using singing as therapy.” The choir, who star on the Manchester City United single by local band Prose, will sing at a memorial event in Man\u0026shy\u0026shychester’s Albert Square on Tuesday. Manchester Together – With One Voice will also feature Parrs Wood High School’s Harmony Group and a mass 30-minute communal singalong.  Choir co-founder Carys, of Otley, near Leeds, was at the Ariana Grande gig with best friend Ella and recalls: “We were waiting to get out when the bomb went off. Somebody shouted there was a gunman so everyone panicked, we ended up under a pile of people. “I’ve struggled a lot with anxiety. Some days you don’t want to get up because the world can seem like such a bad place. “But there are so many good things in the world, too, like the friendships and kindness that came out of it. The choir has been amazing. Now I have the choir I feel a lot safer and understood. I’m at peace.”  As Carys talks, a buffet table is being set up, with cupcakes decorated with the Manchester bee, once symbolic of the city’s industrial heritage but also a symbol of unity since the bombing. Many of the young choristers have had to cope with losing friends. Georgia Faye was at the gig with her best friend Holly but learned the next day that another pal, Georgina Callander, 18, had died in the attack. Georgia, 19, says: “It has been hard. The choir has really helped though. You never have to explain how you’re feeling. Everybody knows already.” Watching the choir rehearse, that spirit of camaraderie is palpable. Natalie Harrison, 15, of Wigan, was at the concert with her mum Melanie but they were in different parts of the Arena when the bomb went off. Melanie recalls her desperate bid to contact Natalie, saying: “I couldn’t even use my phone, my hands were shaking so much.  “There was a surge of people and after about five minutes Natalie just appeared in front of me. I have never been so relieved in my life.” Natalie says: “I get upset because I think about the people who died all the time.

Merryn Crofts, 21, weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME - an incurable condition that affects 250,000 people in the UK. The youngster was unable to take more than two teaspoons of food before suffering immense gut pain and vomiting, a coroner was told. Merryn, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. today became only the second person in the UK to have ME - myalgic encephalomyelitis - listed on a death certificate. Despite being classed as a real neurological disease, many think the condition is not real - some even within the medical profession. Merryn\u0027s mum, Clare Norton, sobbed as she told Rochdale Coroner\u0027s Court how her beautiful and energetic daughter was left wheelchair-bound and reliant on tube feeding.  She said: As a child, she was a bundle of energy. She didn\u0027t walk anywhere - she would hop, skip and jump. She was the kind of person that people gravitated towards. They wanted to be her friend. She was very social and loved drama. She was a total fashionista, a typical teenager. Her bedroom was a mess of clothes, hairspray and tan. But she was also stubborn and I think that helped her cope with her illness in a lot of ways. She never gave up. In August 2011, Merryn, then 15, was diagnosed with hives and swelling shortly after coming back from a family holiday in Mallorca. Tests in early 2012 revealed that at some point she had contracted glandular fever - a virus which can trigger ME. Despite dozens of medical appointments - including mental health checks for panic attacks - Merryn\u0027s condition deteriorated as she suffered breathing problems, exhaustion and excruciating hypersensitivity to touch, light and sound. She was eventually diagnosed with ME in the summer of 2012. The would-be theatre star, who was forced to wear an eye mask, also suffered from severe migraines, brain fog, slurred speech and persistent infections. Stomach problems, and problems swallowing, meant that her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.  Coroner Katherine McKenna was told that Merryn could take on just 100 calories a day because her gut was in so much pain, and that, by 2015, even two teaspoons of nutrients were intolerable. Merryn was eventually fitted with an intravenous nutrition line but suffered intestinal failure and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2016.. She died on May 23, 2017, just days after her 21st birthday. Mrs McKenna today concluded her cause of death as starvation caused by a withdrawal of supportive nutriition, caused by ME. She described Merryn as someone who bore her suffering with dignity and good grace. She said: Merryn had suffered with ME since 2012 which caused severe fatigue, gastointestinal failure, chronic pain, global hypersensitivity, loss of mobility and function. Despite extensive investigations no reason for her gastrointestinal failure which led to her reliance on supportive nutriton was found and it most likely it was caused by her ME. Mum Clare, who attended the inquest with daughter Amy Williams and Merryn\u0027s stepdad Dave Norton, told of her long-standing belief that ME contributed to her death. She said: With ME the key symptom is post-exertional malaise. That means if someone\u0027s energy is pushed beyond what they can tolerate, it will trigger all of their symptoms. The best advice we were given was for Merryn to do just 50% of what she felt capable of. But Merryn didn\u0027t even have 50% to give. She was always crashing, so everything that happened to her kept pushing her further behind.  Pathologist Daniel DuPlessis said that a post-mortem showed low-grade inflammation of nerve roots. It was suggested that this inflammation could have made her bowel hypersensitive to processing nutrients. Dr DuPlessis pointed out that Merryn had inflammation of the ganglia - gatekeepers to sensations in the brain. A post-mortem into the only other UK death attributed to ME, Sophia Mirza, 32, in 2006, also found ganglionitis. ME expert at Salford Royal hospital, Dr Annice Mukherjee, said she was convinced that the illness was responsible for triggering Merryn\u0027s intestinal failure. She said: I haven\u0027t come across a case of ME with life-threatening malnutrition before but I have come across many patients with severe ME that are bedbound that have global sensitivity issues and severe gut issues. But every single patient with ME is different, so I never see the same case twice. The ME Association is at the forefront of improving access to care, treatment and research and removing the disease\u0027s stigma. The charity today called for Merryn\u0027s death not to be in vain. A spokesman said: Firstly, the sympathies of the ME Association are with Merryn’s family today. We hope the result of this inquest provides some closure and allows them to cherish their memories of Merryn. It is essential that Merryn\u0027s untimely death is not overlooked and the urgent need for proper recognition of, and research into, ME is recognised. In our present state of knowledge, we don\u0027t know if ME can kill directly, but there are various consequences of having the illness that can increase the risk of early death. What we do know is this: ME is real. It’s devastating. It leaves people, at best, struggling to work. At worst, it leaves them enduring a tortuous existence, a living death, where they are unable to take their place in society.  One in four are so severely affected that they are housebound, bedbound, and in some cases unable to shower, clothe, or feed themselves. People are taking their lives because they cannot bear the torture this illness brings. Others describe themselves as rotting behind closed curtains. Despite being recognised as a neurological disease, many doctors still don’t know how to diagnose and manage ME/CFS and lack or research means that we still don’t have any effective forms of treatment. This is a completely unacceptable situation for a disease costing the UK economy around \u0026pound3.5billion in lost taxes, healthcare and benefit costs. There is no cure - and the longer it will take to find one unless funding dramatically increases. How many more people have to suffer before ME merits properly funded medical research? Merryn, who loved acting, had dreams of attending a performing arts school in Liverpool and adored musical theatre like Billy Elliott and Wicked. Mental health expert, Dr Ross Overshott, told the inquest that Merryn did not suffer a psychological illness, such as depression or an eating disorder. He said: She was hopeful for the future, she could speak in a very involved way about her hobbies and interests, particularly musicals and films. Before she died, Merryn revealed that she wanted her brain and spinal column to be donated to ME research. They were donated to the ME Association\u0027s Ramsay Research Fund, which conducts research into the causes of the disease.

His lifeless body was found hanged in his room on September 17, 2001, alongside a note that read: “Suicide. The unknown man, described as tall and dark, had checked using an assumed name and left few identifying clues.  An envelope stuffed with with $160 (\u0026pound118) of cash was also found with a message indicating the money was “for the room.” Media coverage of his death speculated possible links to the 9/11 hijackers, due in part to his ‘Middle Eastern’ appearance. The unusual cold case has be central to numerous online conspiracy theories for over a decade. Some speculated that the “John Doe” was part of a team of 19 hijackers whose suicide attacks on New York\u0027s Twin Towers claimed the lives of 3,000 people.  Some thought that he could be a spy or a cult member – as DNA traces initially failed to determine his identity. Those theories have now proved to be false thanks to painstaking forensic work by the non-profit DNA Doe Project organisation.  A team of 20 volunteers spent hundreds of hours running his DNA through a genealogy database in the hope they could discover close genetic matches. The team was eventually able to narrow down the location of his family to Almeda County, California.  “In the end, all the DNA matches and all the family trees and all the research paid off. This took persistence, good solid genealogy and detective work”, a Facebook post by the organisation said. Users of Redddit were instrumental in solving the case. 4,000 of their members scoured web groups in the hope that they would be able to trigger the memories of at least one person who could help. It was also those members who first notified DNA Doe Project about Stevik.  Sadly, the real name of Stevik will not be released to the public out of respect to the privacy of his grieving family. His relatives had assumed that he was still alive and had been avoiding them for decades until they were informed of his death. The dead man was also not from a Middle Eastern background but was in fact a mix of Hispanic and native American.

New York lawyer Aaron Schlossberg was filmed making vile racist comments at Spanish-speaking staff and customers in Fresh Kitchen, Midtown Manhattan, on Tuesday.  He threatened to get them ejected from my country in a tantrum that has been seen online nearly six million times. Now people are responding by trolling him by sending taco trucks, pi\u0026ntildeatas and mariachi bands wearing \u0027party accessories\u0027 playing a children\u0027s song to his office. A GoFundMe campaign, set up by Mark Goldberg on Wednesday, has raised $1,094 (\u0026pound812), double its original $500 target, and an update on the page says a band has been booked.  Raising $500 to send a Mariachi band to cheer up the staff and attorneys at The Law Office of Aaron M. Schlossberg Esq. P.L.L.C. after a difficult day, the page says. We are requesting the band to sing the famous, endearing, and warm Spanish children song, La Cucaracha, the cockroach.  We are countering hate and racism with the sound of music.   Any leftover money will be used to send a delicious Taco Truck lunch to the staff and a copy of all federal and state statute mentioning undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare.  A series of later updates confirmed the band has been booked and said the performance will be recorded provided building security does not kick them out.  The date and time of the band\u0027s visit has not been confirmed to maintain the element of surprise. There was extra money, so party accessories and pi\u0026ntildeatas have been bought. In the minute-long clip, the lawyer can be seen practically squaring up to a man in the restaurant while saying: If you intend on running a place in Midtown Manhattan, your staff should be speaking English, not Spanish. My guess is they\u0027re not documented. So my next call is to ICE to get them ejected from my country. If they have the balls to come here and live off my money, I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be there - the least they could do is speak English.

Craig Mitchell, from Yoker, Glasgow, drove down to Carlisle in the North of England to get his hands on his favourite Hawksridge Cider. In Scotland, the beverage jumped from \u0026pound2.15 for a two-litre bottle to \u0026pound5.75 following the introduction of the controversial legislation.  Now, a 50p minimum price per unit is in place. The move has effectively banned cheap deals on booze in Scotland.    But Craig, 29, swerved the law by driving to Asda in Carlisle on Monday and purchasing 50 bottles of Hawksridge.  Craig spent about \u0026pound100 and saved \u0026pound180 in a purchase he described as a get it up ye to the new pricing in Scotland. It was more of a ‘get it up ye’ to be honest, he said. They can’t take our alcohol off us. I just got over the border and typed ‘Asda’ into my phone. My mate Peter has said not to worry about room to keep it – I can plonk it in his garage. Of course, the savings above don\u0027t factor in the amount Craig spent on fuel. It looks as though he\u0027s got a 4x4, so chances are he spent a good \u0026pound70 on travel. The controversial minimum alcohol pricing policy was introduced in Scotland at the start of this month after a unanimous vote at the Scottish Parliament.

In the eerie video, shot by Raul Arguello, he walks around the deserted venue in Argentina, looking for where a loud door slamming noise is coming from. The 32-year-old captures the moment he bravely shoves open the banging door to discover no one is in the brightly lit room below the bleachers in the Tom\u0026aacutes Adolfo Duc\u0026oacute Stadium in Buenos Aires. But as he pans his camera around the empty space, he unknowingly captures the fleeting instant a spectre quickly passes along the benches, crossing the video frame from left to right and disappearing through the wall. At the time, the apparition appears to be invisible to the naked eye as Arguello doesn’t react to the movement. He later admitted he hadn’t see it.  He only discovered the unnerving phenomenon hours after, when he viewed the footage and found he had apparently registered the spooky presence in the arena, which is home to Atl\u0026eacutetico Hurac\u0026aacuten, a first division club in the Argentinean championship. At the beginning of the haunted encounter the security guard explains in a voice ladened with fear, that to prove he is ‘telling the truth’, he’s going to record the baffling occurrence of the wooden door being constantly wrenched open and banged shut by an unknown force. “It’s 11 o’clock at night and it’s the third time I’ve heard this banging noise,” the frightened man says looking down into the camera while cursing his bad luck for having to face the ordeal alone. “I don’t know what’s going on but I’m going to film it to show people later on, so they believe it when I tell them because this has never happened to me before. It’s terrrifying.” Pointing his camera towards the narrow staircase leading to the dressing rooms he descends the steps with his flashlight in hand. At first the persistent hammering noise is only in the background and sounds muffled, but as he reaches the bottom it escalates into a thunderous din.

Daredevil Charlie Parker has helped his parents care for the animals at Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, since the moment he was able to walk. Charlie, who has his very own pint-sized ranger uniform, held his first snake when he was one and tackled his very first crocodile just two years later. And now, in and around his time at school, Charlie interacts with the animals more than ever – and has big dreams to become a professional zookeeper like one of his idols, Steve Irwin.  Charlie told Barcroft TV: “When I interact with big animals it makes me feel excited. “I like to play with alligators, snakes, lizards and frogs. “When people see me, they’re amazed because I’m so young.” Despite Charlie being nibbled from time to time, he says that he is never scared of interacting with the biggest animals at the park. He said: “I’ve been bitten by a Blue Tongue, a snake, a crocodile, an alligator, a venomous snake that’s called Copperhead and a Black-Headed python.  “I was three when I interacted with my first alligator. It launched at me, launched at me again and then it did a big jump. It was pretty cool. “I’m not afraid of handling snakes or alligators because I’ve worked with them my whole life and I’ve built up a trust to them.” Charlie’s parents, Julia Leonard and Greg Parker, know how comfortable their son is around the animals, but they would never put him in a situation that they thought was risky. Julia, 45, said: “I certainly wouldn’t put him at risk if I thought he was going to get eaten. “Charlie can interact with most animals here at the park – he enjoys working with the penguins, he enjoys working with the mammals and mainly the reptiles.  “He’s very natural around all of them. He’s like a little David Attenborough really. “He really helps out and I think everybody appreciates how good he is with the animals.” With around 50 species of reptiles and 20 species of mammals at the park, Charlie still has his favourite animal – a giant croc called Crunch who weighs around 110 stone. Charlie said: “I like alligators because they launch out of the water. “But my favourite animal is Crunch the crocodile.”  Charlie’s father, Greg, 65, added: “Crunch is a five meter salt-water crocodile that probably weighs around 700 kilos. “Charlie respects Crunch. You know, he’s a big wild-caught crocodile and quite dangerous. “But Charlie is fairly comfortable with him. He goes in there all the time. “We’ve all got bitten fingers and a few scars over the years and Charlie is accruing a few himself. “But here at Ballarat, we believe passionately in conservation and we believe you cannot promote conservation without people meeting the animals up close.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin unveils underwater poseidon","story":"NewsVladimir Putin unveils underwater Poseidon drone that carries nuclear warheads \u0027capable of causing 300ft tsunamis\u0027President Vladimir Putin revealed the development of the drone in his State of the Nation address\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter00:12, 18 MAY 2018Updated23:57, 18 MAY 2018NewsThe underwater drone is a new project under watchful eye of Vladimir Putin (Image: TASS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nuclear-powered underwater drone capable of destroying enemy naval bases and causing huge tsunamis is under construction in Russia, according to a state news agency. The Poseidon will be able to carry a nuclear warhead with a capacity of up to two megatonnes, a source told TASS. The source said: It will be possible to mount various nuclear charges on the ‘torpedo’ of the Poseidon multipurpose seaborne system, with the thermonuclear single warhead... to have the maximum capacity of up to 2 megatonnes in TNT equivalent. With its nuclear munition, the underwater drone is primarily designed to destroy reinforced naval bases of a potential enemy, the source said. The drone will have a speed of 60-70 knots and will be operational at a depth of more than 1km.  TASS has not been able to confirm the information. Rex Richardson, a physicist, told Business Insider: A well-placed nuclear weapon of yield in the range 20 MT to 50 MT near a sea coast could certainly couple enough energy to equal the 2011 tsunami, and perhaps much more. Taking advantage of the rising-sea-floor amplification effect, tsunami waves reaching 100 meters [330 feet] in height are possible.” The project of developing the Poseidon drone was unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his State of the Nation address to the Federal Assembly on March 1. The Russian leader said that these drones could be armed with both conventional and nuclear munitions and would be capable of destroying enemy infrastructure, carrier-led naval forces and other objectives.  Russia’s president claimed the Poseidon will have “hardly any vulnerabilities” and said it would carry a “massive nuclear ordinance”.

site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first images of a “game-changing” new custody unit to be built in the Hilltown are exclusively revealed in the Tele.The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) held a consultation on its women’s community custodial unit (CCU) at the Maxwell Centre yesterday.These images were on display at the drop-in session, and SPS staff were on hand to answer questions and explain the unit’s purpose.The Dundee CCU will be the second of its kind in Scotland, following a similar unit being built in the Maryhill area of Glasgow.The facility is expected to open by 2020, and will host up to 16 inmates.Tom Fox, of the SPS, said CCUs are a “gamechanger” in the way female offenders are managed.“This will make a real difference to the lives of the women coming into our care,” he added.“There is a consensus that there are too many women in prison in Scotland.“Female offending is different (from males) – the reasons behind it are varied and complex.“A lot of the women in our care have been subjected to significant trauma in their lives, whether domestic, emotional or otherwise.“What we are trying to do is support them in a way that allows them to take control of their own lives and live positive lives on the outside.”Mr Fox explained the facility was deliberately “domestic” in design, to help it blend into the area.He said: “It will not look like a custodial facility. That is deliberate.“There will not be a big fence, but there will be a secure entry – a single way in and out. If anything, the entrance looks like a health centre.“It’s going to be staffed and have security on site 24/7. There will be shielding in the way of existing trees and additional planting. It will look like a domestic environment.”CCUs will house female offenders who are serving shorter sentences, or coming to the end of longer ones.About a third of the inmates – five or six at most – will occasionally go out into the community for work placements or activities.Some of those trips will be accompanied, while others will not but will have licensing conditions attached.Mr Fox made it clear there would be “consequences” for those who breach their conditions.Visitors will also have to abide by prison-style rules on visiting hours at the complex, which will close to the public at night, and locals will be able to call a 24-hour helpline, Prison Watch, should they have any concerns.SPS bosses hope that today’s information event will allay residents’ fears about the CCU, amid concerns about it bringing more crime into the area and denting house prices.Locals have also questioned the wisdom of placing a custodial unit next to a school – in this case, the Coldside Community Campus under construction.However, Mr Fox said that he had seen no issues in the area surrounding Cornton Vale women’s prison in Stirling – the predecessor to the CCUs.He said: “At Cornton Vale we’ve never had any problems with women going out into the community.“I also don’t think there is any evidence of facilities having an impact on house prices.“There has been an expansive range of housing built beside Cornton Vale after it was built. There’s a school beside it, which offenders walk past every day.“Do we recognise that people have concerns? Of course we do.“But letting people see what we are proposing is not what they expect is quite crucial. People get concerned when something new and unknown is proposed to them – that’s perfectly reasonable.“The fact we’re talking with the community, I think, means these concerns can be assuaged.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
