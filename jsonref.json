Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"Vigilantes use metal plate tattoo Por Rata Rat suspected oil thiefs back","story":"    A man suspected of stealing oil from residents near Mexico city was punished by vigilantes who placed a hot metal plate over his upper backThe suspect fuel thief appears in the video laying face down on a street in Ecatepec, a town north of Mexico City, according to Mexican news outlet Criterio Hidalgo. His head is covered with a black hood and his hands are handcuffed.The suspect lets out a loud moan as the vigilante presses the hot metal plate over his upper back for a period of 18 seconds before the video cuts off.Is this Australia\u0027s most bizarre burglary?

Firstly, could we get over feeling sorry for Theresa May?Bruce, who has taken over from David Dimbleby to host the programme, then interrupted her, saying: \u0027Hang on, hang on - do you never feel sorry for her?\u0027And the woman replied: \u0027No, I don\u0027t feel sorry for her. She is the woman who for many, many years has led the hostile environment for migrants in this country - which resulted in the Windrush generation, it\u0027s a disgrace.\u0027She\u0027s the person who created her very specific red lines on immigration in the ECJ which have created the negotiation mess that we\u0027re in.

The woman delivered a forceful 80-second speech which criticised the Prime Minister             Fiona Bruce was hosting her first Question Time after taking over the role from David Dimbleby\u0027And as to criticising the EU on this, there are 27 other countries in the EU. They have been completely united on this.

Brexit was the first and primary topic of discussion and interruption on the first Question Time since the Christmas break, and Bruce was praised for pressing guests on the Brexit deal, Conservative leave strategy, and alleged Labour electioneering over the EU.Bruce took over from Dimbleby who had presented the often-heated debate show for 25 years.The show had received some criticism for recitations of various party lines, and sometimes angry clashes.The new-look show was filmed in the Jeremy Corbyn heartland of Islington, and featured voices from both sides of the isive Brexit debate."},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible moment Chinese rocket carrying countrys new state art satellite takes off","story":"The satellite, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, has entered the preset orbit.The Chinese-made communication and broadcasting satellite will provide transmission services for the country\u0027s radio, television stations and cable television networks.The Zhongxing-2D satellite and Long March-3B carrier rocket were both developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.China launched a record-breaking 39 orbital missions in 2018, and Friday morning\u0027s was the 298th mission of the Long March rocket series.Russian workmen destroy building\u0027s entrance foyer when they...Share this article    China sends Zhongxing-2D satellite into space on a Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province at 1.11am, January 11, 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"No deal Brexit cause GDP shrink 8 cent","story":"Boris Johnson, 54, spends New Year with his new ex-Tory aide...\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...Share this article    Carolyn Fairbairn has urged MPs to back Theresa May (pictured above) and put the country before politics \u0027Businesses would face new costs and tariffs.

She is the woman who for many, many years has led the hostile environment for migrants in this country - which resulted in the Windrush generation, it\u0027s a disgrace.\u0027She\u0027s the person who created her very specific red lines on immigration in the ECJ which have created the negotiation mess that we\u0027re in.

They have been completely united on this.

The photo of wedding at Chawton House is my favourite.\u0027The sheer amount of bridesmaids is extraordinary.

Chawton House - or rather a cottage on the family estate - is where she wrote in the last years of her life.\u0027The album is an important insight because Jane\u0027s family were so important to her, because she had no children of her own. I think the album allows us to learn more about her through her family\u0027s lives.\u0027Mrs Ievers got interested in family history while researching her husband\u0027s ancestry and the history of their home, Mount Ievers Court and bought the album off eBay in November.

When Karen shared some of the photos with me I could hardly believe it.          Historians are currently pouring over the album and experts are hoping to stage an exhibition of the photos in the future\u0027Her nieces were very important to Jane Austen, which gives this album a special significance. She knew them well, not least because she went to stay with them, effectively as the poor relation coming to help look after them.\u0027She often supervised the three girls - Cassandra, Marianne and Louisa - sometimes even doing their mending, listening to their reading, taking Marianne to the theatre and the dentist when she was only twelve, or letting them stay in the room as she discussed her plots with her sister or made notes for her novels. She was part of their lives.\u0027Jane Austen was dead by the time the girls grew up, but they lived out, quite without meaning to, the plots of her novels.\u0027Take Marianne - her life in some ways echoed the plot of Sense and Sensibility. She found herself like Elinor and her namesake Marianne pretty much evicted from the house by her own brother.\u0027And when Cassandra fell in love with Lord George Hill, his mother was less than pleased because she had no money.\u0027Just as in Persuasion, they had to part for eight years until, like Persuasion\u0027s Captain Wentworth, he returned and they could marry.\u0027Lord George\u0027s mother echoed Pride and Prejudice\u0027s Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were, quite uncannily at times, living out the plots of Jane Austen\u0027s novels.\u0027As in the novels, this album shows naval and military men, women who were compelled to marry well or live upon the goodwill of male family members, foolish or devoted clergymen and questions of inheritance or disinheritance.\u0027In the novels, the heroines have often lost a parent at a young age - and we see that time and time again in this album. Cassandra died in childbirth just like her mother. The parallels are there.

She reflected them in her plots, so strangely re-enacted in the lives of her nieces, in this album.\u0027To see these illustrated in the pages of this album underlines the universality of her work. Her work is full of deep profound truths.\u0027To see in these rare photographs the faces of those I have been writing about for so many years is quite extraordinary.\u0027Historians are currently pouring over the album and experts are hoping to stage an exhibition of the photos in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"BMI flight 22 passengers veers Bristol Airport runway","story":"    The BMI plane that had 22 passengers, on the grass after it left the runway at Bristol Airport           The Embraer 145 plane came to a halt with the front wheel embedded in the grassAlthough shaken by the experience, the passengers and crew on board the Embraer 145 plane were unscathed.Audio recordings from inside the cockpit revealed the panic of the captain - who was under training and new to both the aircraft and the airline.The commander - who was mentoring the trainee captain - suggests that the speed brake should be used as the aircraft comes in for landing.Man, 62, dies after being decapitated by a helicopter blade...Economist, 54, who is accused of assault after three cabin...Share this articleThe pilot responds: \u0027It is, oh no it\u0027s not, who closed that?\u0027A synopsis of the incident says the flight crew noticed the nose gear touched down \u0027sharply\u0027 after the main gear before the pilot lost control.The report reads: \u0027The pilot flying was unable to maintain directional control during the landing roll and the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway onto the grass.

Lanchester talks about refugees, Brexit – and optimismDesperate refugees risking their lives crossing the Channel in small boats in the dead of night extreme temperatures forcing people to flee their homes politicians inciting a fear of others, and railing against traitors who “want us to be overrun, to be washed away”. These are not recent news stories, but a glimpse of a possible era after climate catastrophe, or the “Change” as it is known in one of the first big novels of the year, John Lanchester’s The Wall. Lanchester imagines a moment in the future when rising sea levels mean there isn’t a single beach left on the planet, those countries that remain habitable have become fortresses and the young feel bitterly betrayed by the previous generation because of the destroyed world they have inherited. We are barely into 2019 and the future already seems terrifyingly bleak.“I didn’t crack my knuckles and sit down to write a novel about now. I was halfway through another novel. I still am,” Lanchester explains, almost apologetically. “It’s not the future, but it’s a version of a future, and it feels a lot like a version of the future that we are heading for.”With the emphasis on borders, fear of invasion and lines such as: “This country is the best in the world”, and, of course, the wall itself – “a long, low concrete monster” – it is hard not to read the novel as a riff on Brexit and the US under Trump, as well as a chilling ecological dystopia. Post-2016, a wall is surely shorthand for ugly political and ideological ision (as with the grisly punishment wall in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, written in Berlin in 1984). “One of the things about the wall in the book is that it is not a metaphor for anything else,” the author insists. “We had this period when walls were coming down around the world and now, just as an empirical fact, they are springing up all over the place.” And he hasn’t been following Brexit obsessively – “a gigantic waste of emotional energy. Danny Dyer seems like a deathless genius of political science for asking: ‘What is it?’”Lanchester is one of Britain’s most celebrated essayists, with a canny journalistic instinct as a novelist, from his award-winning 1996 debut The Debt to Pleasure, a balsamic-black foodie satire written at a moment of peak gastro-porn during a stint as the Observer’s restaurant critic, to his last novel Capital, a Dickensian saga of the London property bubble, published in 2012. He distinguishes his non-fiction and fiction in terms of subjects that interest him, “things happening in the world” and “the things that won’t leave you alone”. For novels, he says: “There’s this sort of psychic charge, there’s something unresolved, that’s why the images keep coming back.” And for this, his fifth, the image was of a person standing guard on a wall. It initially came to him in the form of a recurring dream. The author tells himself “sort of half-conscious” stories to help get to sleep: “It works, by the way, I sleep really well.” The dream first began in 2016 “and it wouldn’t quite go away. Then I started thinking about who the person was and what the world was. It didn’t exactly write itself but it came much more quickly than my other books,” he says. “It was much more than a metaphor. It was an image, a country with a wall round it.”The son of a South African-born banker and an Irish mother (the troubling story of his parents’ marriage is affectingly recounted in Family Romance, 2007), Lanchester describes himself as “a well-disguised semi-immigrant” he was born in Germany in 1962 had lived in seven different countries by the time he was four and spent much of his childhood in Hong Kong (the inspiration for his 2002 novel Fragrant Harbour). For him, the image of the wall is a “comforting” rather than a disturbing one. Growing up, he was very aware that “Hong Kong was safe and that just over the border there was a place where people were desperate to escape from, and that people died trying to get over the border, people drowned swimming. There was a street called Boundary Street, and if you got to Boundary Street you could stay, you weren’t repatriated. For a child’s imagination there was something very vivid about that, and the thing which stuck with me is that you are in the place that is safe.” For this reason, he struggles to understand fears over immigration, of “being swamped or overrun or threatened in some way. If people want to get to the place where you are, that means you are in a safe place.”Witty and softly spoken, he has been described as resembling “an off-duty bank manager”, partly because he is unafraid of nerdy subjects (only Lanchester could make the Vix Index of market volatility interesting, as he did in How to Speak Money) so that there are few genres he hasn’t tackled. “You make me sound like Meryl Streep: ‘She does Polish, she does Jewish, she does Wasp, she does funny!’” he grumbles.Although he seems too rooted in the here and now, too interested in the intricacies of systems from the London tube to the FTSE, to contemplate science fiction, it should be no surprise that he has now taken on the most urgent issue of our times in this slim yet devastating work of speculative fiction. He chafes slightly at the label, recalling JG Ballard asking him not to mention SF in an interview he was writing, “because he felt you automatically lose half the readers”. While that has undoubtedly changed, he argues that, as a subject, global warming is already scientific fact. If any novelist is going to make real the nightmare scenarios we are storing up, it is Lanchester. He began Capital in 2006, after all. “Any fool could see that there was a crash coming,” he says now. Is there going to be another recession? “Yes, I’d have thought so, but heaven only knows what form it will take.”Quoting the German economist Rudi Dornbusch in a  piece on the TV adaptation of Capital in 2015, Lanchester wrote: “In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.” Substitute the environment for economics and the consequences are catastrophic.“I think, unfortunately, that is the way that change happens,” Lanchester says. “There’s a bitter truth in Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises. ‘How did you go broke?’ ‘Two ways. Gradually then suddenly.’ Lots of things happen like that.”He is deliberately opaque about the timeframe in which The Wall is set: “There are all sorts of feedback effects of climate, which means we don’t know how fast it is going to happen.” Researching an essay for the London Review of Books back in 2007 (which begins by anticipating the radical civil disobedience of groups such as Extinction Rebellion), he was haunted by the idea of “climate departure”– a point in the future when the coldest average day “is warmer than the warmest average day in the past”, he summarises. As he says, it’s best not to think about it too hard. But the powerful “psychological resistance” and “denial” that he identified as characterising our response to climate change are an indulgence no longer available to us, as the extreme weather, not to mention the dire warnings of the IPCC report, last year made clear.He has two children, now 20 and 16, with his wife the writer Miranda Carter, and is acutely aware of the legacy we are leaving behind. “It will be wonderful for it not to be the thing that fundamentally alters the texture of human existence, but the evidence doesn’t suggest that,” he says. “Just ask a gardener. I was talking to a wine person about English grapes. Part of the reason we have all this sparkling wine now is that 30 years ago they were harvesting champagne in mid-to-late October, now it’s in August. That’s not a metaphor for anything.”It is a commonplace that all dystopias are versions of the present, and Lanchester quotes William Gibson’s famous line: “The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed.” In the novel, a young “Defender” reflects on the old world: “The produce you could get before the Change,” she said. “Everything, all the time. Tomatoes and fruits, hams from you name it, meat whenever you liked it, all of it all the year around … it’s like science fiction, where they have a machine that just makes stuff … Where does it all end? I mean, the idea is amazing ... and yet it’s weird and it’s wrong too.”Lanchester came of age in the early 1980s, when “things were pretty grim”. “People have always been frightened about the end of the world – that’s the nature of who we are,” he says, recalling how as a teenager the threat of nuclear war created similar feelings of inidual impotence and impending doom. But what makes the current moment “particularly desperate”, he believes, “is the absence of a will to do anything about it … Trump gives a sort of autonomy for the forces that are actively lying.”Along with our capacity for “selective amnesia”, as a species “we have an amazing talent for being oblivious, we are really, really good at it,” he marvels. “Maybe … how unbearable it is if you are not. Because the alternative is back on the smartphones and the constant firehose of bad news. I’m not sure we innately have the tools to deal with that. We haven’t worked out what to do about these,” he says picking up my mobile as if it had just dropped from space.The novel’s blockbuster ending is appropriately uncertain. Is there any room for hope? As he says, climate change is a story in which we deeply don’t want to believe. “Well, I’m not sure,” he replies, rather crushingly. “I don’t think there’s going to be a Live Aid style reunification concert five years later.”How do you follow a novel about the destruction of the planet as we know it? “If history shows us anything, it’s a school for wizards, or a novel about bunny rabbits or something.”While a Hogwarts for rabbits seems unlikely, his next novel is bound to be something completely different. He likes to use a metaphor of a hall with a series of rooms off it to describe the writing process: “You know there’s something in that room, you are attracted by it but frightened at the same time. You stay in the room for as long as it takes to write it, it’s a day-in, day-out thing. And then at the end of it, that door’s opened out. Why would you go back?”He has a strict word count per day: 500 for fiction, 1,000 for non-fiction and 1,500 for journalism. And he never fails to hit it. “The thing is,” he quavers in his best Alan Bennett impression, “you feel ill if you don’t!” (as Bennett once told him when asked how he did it). “It’s true. Then what are you for? That’s your job.” (Although, reassuringly, he “not infrequently” goes back to bed of a morning, following Hilary Mantel’s advice that it’s crucial to get enough sleep before writing. “If I start the day too early, I can’t.”) And when he finally clocks off, he’s a big fan of the TV box set: writers can only hope their novels are “as well written as very good telly”, he says.He plans to return to the novel abandoned before The Wall, “but it’s been putting up quite a good fight”. He also wants to complete a collection of short stories, having recently had one, the first he has written, published in the New Yorker. “Seriously! I don’t want to boast but I was very proud of that,” he admits endearingly. “There are not many things that happen in your mid 50s that give you a genuine rush.”For the immediate future, he hopes 2019 “is easier on all of us than the last couple of years”. And in the long term? “My main ambition, my main hope for the book, is that I’m wrong.”• The Wall is published by Faber on 17 January.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you’ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates:Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):Vikram Seth - A Suitable BoyRichard Powers - The OverstoryDavid Park - Travelling in a Strange LandGraham Greene - The Quiet AmericanMargaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s TaleJL Carr - A Month in the CountryJohn le Carré - The Spy Who Came in from the ColdSomerset Maugham - Of Human BondageLima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo QuaresmaEdward St Aubyn - Never MindTatiana Salem Levy - The House at SmyrnaPenelope Lively - Moon TigerLooking at my reading this year, I learned three things:1. It’s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.2. Having a perception of an author’s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn’t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carré, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren’t for you folks’ advocacy. So thank you so much.Here’s another 2018 summary, from interwar:Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 ‘most rewarding reads’ of 2018 include fiction only, and I’m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others’ judgements. Note that by ‘most rewarding’ I don’t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.Four were re-reads:Wilkie Collins, The MoonstoneE M Forster, A Passage to IndiaR K Narayan, The World of NagarajOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayTen were translations:Shusako Endo, VolcanoWolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering PlantIsmaiil Kadare, The Traitor’s NicheWalter Kempowski, HomelandLaszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes OnAyiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the RuinsOrhan Pamuk, SnowAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in BaghdadJose Saramago, The Elephant’s JourneyMario Vargas Llosa, The StorytellerAnd the rest:Elizabeth Bowen, The Last SeptemberRoland Camberton, Rain on the PavementsGabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in BarnesPhilip Larkin, A Girl in WinterWilliam Maxwell, The Folded LeafAlex Pheby, LuciaI could have included dozens more lists of similar quality – although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn’t catalogue their reading or didn’t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts – and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart:I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I’m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton’s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I’m not yet in love with this series but I’m too invested in the characters to drop out.Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:It’s a “punk” book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman’s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a “child abuser”. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he’s tried anything physical).Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It’s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading.Ellie Rose has also just “devoured” Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman:I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I’d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think!Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a “re-re-reading” of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations:I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping.

I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.”Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he’s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess.His requirements are specific – he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can’t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep.He doesn’t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were removed by the city’s transport department.His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown.“There was one time on south side of Chicago. This cop gets out and walks up to me and says, ‘Are you that pothole guy?’“‘Yeah,’ I said.“He goes, ‘That is so fucking cool.’”Find more of Jim Bachor’s art on his website.

The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, is far from alone in circling the carcass of Theresa May’s premiership – although quite how a remainer is to triumph in a vote of the Ukip-ised Tory grassroots is difficult to answer – and her speech today, appropriately in a jobcentre, certainly represents positioning.As well as suggesting the benefits freeze may, possibly, end next year, her heavily trailed announcement is that the retrospective implementation of the two-child limit on universal credit won’t happen. The newly born third child of a supermarket worker, nurse or admin assistant – from the “just about managing” families May claimed to champion – will still have their support taken away.Bear in mind that most families in poverty are actually working families, earning their poverty. And because of deliberate government policy, we’ve just had the biggest annual jump in child poverty in Britain since 1988. That the benefits freeze remains in place means real-terms cuts to the incomes of many of those struggling the most.In classic Tory style, this raid on the poorer sections of society is accompanied by continued cuts on the taxes paid by big business who, just coincidentally, bankroll the Conservative party. That Rudd’s spinners believe cancelling a retrospective raid on desperately needed support for children provides a compassionate gloss on this class war – let’s call it what it is – must be treated as a calculated insult and nothing else.There is positive news among all this. In the Cameron-Osborne era, benefits claimants had become so utterly demonised by government and media (and many senior Labour politicians) alike, that the war on the welfare state was met with widespread public indifference or even enthusiasm. There were relentless attempts to turn the resentment of low-paid workers against the unemployed: the logic being, don’t be angry at the boss slashing your wage, or the government cutting your in-work benefits, but at the “scrounger” living a supposed luxurious lifestyle down the road.Osborne himself infamously played the “shift-worker” against the neighbour with their “closed blinds” who slept “off a life on benefits”. A Tory ide-and-rule strategy claimed it was “strivers” versus “shirkers”. And let us not forget that, after the 2015 general election, Labour’s transient leadership scandalously backed the Tories’ two-child benefits policy. Without Labour’s shift in political direction under Jeremy Corbyn, don’t dare to imagine the depths the party would have sunk to in a race to the bottom with the Tories.That the Tories are being forced to shift their rhetoric shows public attitudes have moved. The cuts to social security have now hurt too many and Labour’s redirecting of popular anger away to the vested interests at the top has reframed the debate.That doesn’t mean Labour isn’t deserving of criticism. Although the party is committed to reversing many of the benefits cuts, the risk is too many would still remain in place. Their tax hikes on big business and the well-off should be hiked further to reverse all cuts to social security in full. But so long as the Tories remain in power, the class war from above will continue.May claimed austerity would come to an end: the truth is, those at the top never endured it, and for the majority, austerity is set to continue indefinitely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b1eeae113d9c505498446707a531119f7fce46/285_78_4268_2561/master/4268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e9cb4c8b9f939f94f471f4104a0876","title":"brexit theresa may prime minister deal","story":"Whatever else happens with Brexit, no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable. The pressure of the article 50 clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs. She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs, hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan. Earlier this week, in an act of parliamentary jujitsu, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May, securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses.Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions. So far that hasn’t worked. Instead, the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space, which, in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics, raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up.May has been holding the lid, keeping the pressure on. It is her deal that MPs will almost certainly reject, and hers alone. Brexit itself does not depend on this particular prime minister. It is easy to forget that, when the whole business has felt like a Shakespearean tragedy with May at its centre: the hostage to pitiless circumstance undone by her own flaws, consumed by a megalomaniacal sense of duty – a monstrous hybrid of piety and arrogance.But next week begins the great disentanglement, when threads of what parliament might endorse will be separated and sorted, regardless of what May wants. Brexit law has now been amended and re-amended so many ways that power lies neither with the government nor with MPs. Parliament gets to say what it thinks should happen – the prime minister isn’t bound by law to do it, but would surely not survive long in office if she flatly refused.And so the race is on to form some cross-party coalition that can agree on some kind of plan: any plan that is not May’s one, and doesn’t involve flying off the no-deal cliff edge. As one cabinet minister put it to me recently: once that coalition is found, “it is then effectively the government”. It is premature to say that discussions are under way to form some national unity administration, but the idea is being seriously kicked around among pro-European Tories who imagine that disaffected moderate Labour MPs, worn down by dissidence in Jeremy Corbyn’s regime, can be recruited to a temporary arrangement that gets the country safely through the next few months.In my experience, remain-leaning Conservatives underestimate the gravitational force of Labour tribalism, regardless of who is leader, but it is certainly true that dismay over Brexit has created some surprising friendships that cross partisan lines.The two main propositions competing to prove their viability are the second referendum (under the banner of a people’s vote), and a Brexit model that keeps the UK inside the single market and the customs union, once characterised as Norway plus and now rebranded “common market 2.0”.Neither camp can yet muster a majority. The “Norwegians” say their numbers are artificially low because many Tories who support them, including cabinet ministers, have to pretend to back May’s deal right up until the moment it fails. But Tory people’s vote supporters also claim to have sleeper cells of ministerial endorsement. Labour MPs on both sides argue that their leader will eventually come to see the logic of their preferred option.It is a peculiar rivalry between factions who agree with each other about most of what is wrong with Brexit. They would almost certainly back each other’s proposal if their own were eliminated. The people’s vote side would prefer common market 2.0 to May’s deal. Many of the common market 2.0 brigade would go for a referendum if they were more confident that public opinion had shifted so far that the result would be a slam dunk for remain. Meanwhile, each side has to manage the awkward geometry of coalition-building across the floor of the Commons. When a Tory declares for a people’s vote, it makes it harder for the left to sign up. When former remainers back common market 2.0, it is harder to sell it to leavers as a bona fide Brexit. It is the classic Rubik’s Cube conundrum – lining up the colours on one face ruins another one.The one thing all can agree on – the only proposition for which a Commons majority has already been demonstrated this year – is that Britain should not crash out of the EU without a deal. The problem is that no deal is the scenario that requires the least action. It is what happens if everyone just carries on being pretty much as they have done, failing to organise around any one goal. MPs can rail against the idea of no deal, but that doesn’t prove it can’t happen.Many things were unthinkable before they started to look feasible, then suddenly became inevitable. Brexit was one. A second referendum might be another. May somehow bulldozing her deal through parliament cannot be ruled out completely.She has said many times that the UK leaves the EU on 29 March – but many officials believe that an extension to the article 50 period is inevitable. Even if parliament approves a deal, there isn’t much time to pass the subsequent enabling legislation. We are at the stage of the Brexit drama where every possible outcome has been ruled out at some point. The final act has to involve some shift in perceptions of what is possible. Birnam Wood is on its way to Dunsinane. The Brexit tragedy that was all about Theresa May’s ambition and misjudgments is coming to an end.The sequel is a story of rebel bands in parliament competing for power as it flies from the prime minister’s hands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239181261ca47e51d2da90d2c87621d2aad5ca87/0_1540_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=790e61ce079e2f8f3338c8e5b24b7240","title":"horror scene the man who found the sidmouth fatberg","story":"Charlie Ewart discovered the 64-metre lump and will be part of the team breaking it up Charlie Ewart, a 51-year-old father of two from Plymouth, has been battling blockages in the sewers of south-west England for 15 years.But even he was not prepared for the dreadful sight, and smell, of what he found lurking beneath the elegant seafront in the regency town of Sidmouth when he scrambled through a small manhole.“I saw it and thought: ‘What on earth?’ It was completely unexpected,” Ewart said. “It’s really eerie in that bit of the sewer and it does look like something out of a horror scene, all congealed and glossy and matted together with all kinds of things.”Happily for Ewart, it was not a monster risen from the depths or from outer space but rather a fatberg – a mass of congealed oils, grease wet wipes and other nasties measuring the size of six double-decker buses.Sidmouth’s fatberg, which has been gathering beneath beneath the Esplanade for years, has provoked interest around the world. Visitors have arrived in Sidmouth to examine the spot and try to pick up a whiff. South West Water is opening a pop-up shop to explain what is happening and warn people of the dangers of dropping things they shouldn’t down the toilet and sink.Meanwhile, Ewart and his hardy colleagues have the job of getting rid of the 64-metre-long object.“The sewer will be active while we carry out the removal, so depending on the flows, we could be wading through a lot of muck,” said Ewart.“We are going to be using small shovels and something called a mattock – this is like a lighter version of a pickaxe so we won’t tire as quickly. We also have special high-pressure sewer jetting equipment and something to suck it out in bits.“I think this fatberg is going to be soft on the outside but hard in the middle. I’m not too sure what is within it yet, there’s a lot of wet wipes and sanitary wrappers, but I’ve tried not to look at it too closely yet, especially as I’m going to be staring at it for eight weeks.”The team will have to wear breathing apparatus when they are underground. The smell is not pleasant, a heady combination of rotting meat mixed with the odour of an unclean toilet. Yet despite admitting to having a phobia of rats, Ewart said he was relishing the challenge.“It’s not a job for everyone but I take a huge amount of pride in what I do. People don’t think about it when they put things down the loo or sink, but someone has to deal with the consequences.”The tale of the Sidmouth fatberg provides an insight into the changing nature, good as well as bad, of the UK’s attitude to sewage – and the nation’s toilet habits.It nestles in what was a large holding tank built in Victorian or regency times. In those days, the town’s raw sewage would be held in the tank and simply released on an outgoing tide. After the privatisation of the water industry in 1989, South West Water introduced its £1.5bn Clean Sweep programme designed to improve the quality of sea water for bathers.As part of the project, a large pumping station was built at the end of the Esplanade. Sewage now flows through the holding tank where the fatberg resides and is pumped up to a treatment works inland at Sidford. After being treated it is piped back down to the sea and treated effluent is discharged into an offshore outfall. It is now safe and enjoyable to bathe off Sidmouth.So far, so good. But in recent years some people have begun to put more and more objects down the toilet and continued to pour oil and fat down the sink.South West Water’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said the industry had become accustomed to dealing with condoms, nappies and sanitary products. But then came the wet wipe.“The proliferation of wet wipe-type products has started to generate a real problem,” said Roantree. “The wet wipes tend to create a matrix that all these other things get caught up in.” In a kind of snowball effect, the wet wipes congeal with fats, oil and grease, gradually forming a hard mass.But why did nobody notice the Sidmouth monster forming? For a start, the network is huge – South West Water looks after more than 10,000 miles of sewer pipes. And the size of the tank under the Esplanade, up to three metres high in places and as wide as the street, meant that sewage and discharged water was not blocked by its mass. The waste carried on reaching the pumping station at the end of the Esplanade and no alarm bells were sounded.The fatberg is estimated to have had two years to develop before Ewart found it, close to the yacht club and RNLI lifeboat station. Its removal is expected to cost £100,000 and some south-west residents have questioned why they should have to pay for a Sidmouth problem.But Roantree said the company spends about £5m a year on clearing blockages of all shapes and sizes from across its region. “We have 8,500 blockages a year. It happens right across our region.”South West Water is keen to get over the message that only the “three Ps” – poo, pee and paper – should end up in a toilet.The last word should surely go to the heroic finder and, hopefully, vanquisher, of the fatberg.“I’m married and have two girls,” he said. “I have made sure to educate my family on what they put down the loo and sink. My elder daughter loves makeup, but she knows not to put wipes of any kind down the toilet.“We even use cheap toilet roll, which goes down the loo much easier than the thicker stuff. When you see the consequences like I do, you make sure to do all you can, even if it’s just so you don’t block up your own pipes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38a97eb7e6bdd31f9bd304ce1a54638655c7f59/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5ef15384b6ec7801e96f72b1c1ba34","title":"frozen history climate change greenland ice sheet in pictures","story":"Buried deep under the Greenland ice sheet is a unique archive of life on Earth 40,000 years ago.

Smart-cold doesn’t get printed in invitations, but it is an unspoken dress code with which you will almost certainly have to grapple over the next two months. One can’t neglect standards just because the mercury dips.

But if you abandon all sartorial coordinates and dress only for warmth, piling on random layers and hats and scarves and gloves, you end up lumpy and bundled and chaotic. Snowman-who-got-dressed-in-the-dark is not a good look, and streamlining your outfit can help you feel more in control of your battle with the elements.Third: colour. There is plenty of gloom and darkness at this time of year. Black can be chic, but when dark scarves and coats and boots are layered together, the overall effect becomes unhelpfully apocalyptic.

And Politico tweeted: “How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux – written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?” And so on.Ironically, in 2016, Warren was perceived as “infinitely more likable than Hillary”. But now she has thrown her hat into the ring, commentators are lining up to remind us how uncomfortable they are with powerful women, and also how uncomfortable they are with admitting it – since their doubts are invariably couched in terms such as “there have been questions about …” In other words: “Many people say …”It got me wondering about what makes a character in the movies likable or unlikable. After all, an entire screenwriting manual, Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, is named after “the scene where we meet the hero and the hero does something – like saving a cat – that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him”. And no, I don’t think Lt Ellen Ripley would be nearly as popular a character if she had left Jones behind in the Nostromo to get blown up. But on GamesRadar’s list of 50 Most Likable Movie Characters, only seven are women, and of those seven, only Fargo’s Marge Gunderson strikes me as a genuinely likable person, as opposed to irritant, doormat or nanny. Yes, Mary Poppins has many fine qualities, but being likable isn’t one of them.Recently, we have been seeing a new wave of unlikable female protagonists. It kicked off with 2016’s highly isive Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams as a character who was “not easily likable”, in the words of film critic Barry Wurst. And not everyone, it turns out, is a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite. Sure enough, reasons given include (and I didn’t have to dig deep for these examples) “Not liking any of the characters” “wholly unlikable female characters” and “everyone in this film is a varying shade of unlikable”.Yet I would contend that The Favourite’s three leading characters are likable – in small and volatile doses. None of them saves a cat, but we start off by automatically siding with Abigail (Emma Stone) because she is an underdog, and, from Oliver Twist to The Karate Kid to Harry Potter, we have learned to root for underdogs. Abigail’s likability is only confirmed when palace servants (with whom she is billeted) play a vile trick on her – we’re used to sympathising with victims. We are on safe ground here: Abigail is shaping up to be a traditional heroine. And we like her even more as she finds cunning ways to insinuate herself into the queen’s favours, because, from Elizabeth Bennett to Jo March to Hermione Granger, we are accustomed to siding with heroines who are clever.Yet that cleverness eventually curdles, until we are faced with the possibility that Abigail may not be so likable after all. Similarly, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) veers between likability (she seems genuinely fond of the Queen) and steely-eyed ambition – a quality perceived as anything but likable in a woman, as Clinton and Warren have discovered.Even Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), initially depicted as capricious, self-absorbed and ridiculous, is shown to have suffered devastating heartbreak – and just like that, we find ourselves liking her more. In the end, much of The Favourite’s deliciousness as an entertainment stems from our emotional allegiances being tugged this way and that by women who are not simply good or evil but flawed, multifaceted human beings. Just like real people.If you think Abigail, Anne and Sarah are unlikable, get a load of Erin Bell in Karyn Kusama’s Destroyer. Our first view of Bell is pink-rimmed bloodshot eyes squinting out of sun-damaged skin. She is a Los Angeles detective ravaged by alcohol, cigarettes and traumatic memories of an undercover assignment gone horribly wrong, and Nicole Kidman plays her with the sort of fearlessness (and help from makeup designer Bill Corso) that makes her Oscar-winning fake nose for The Hours look like a party trick. The days of Jane Fonda being able to pass as an alcoholic in The Morning After (1986) just by mussing her hair are long gone. “You look terrible,” says a colleague of Erin’s, and so she does. And Kidman’s transformation is more than just grandstanding – her ruined face reflects her character’s story.In Destroyer, Kidman sacrifices one of the strongest weapons in a film star’s arsenal – her good looks (deemed more essential for actresses than actors), and with it a shortcut to securing our sympathies. According to innumerable studies, including this 2011 Harvard-related one, we are conditioned to see beautiful people as more likable and for every Hunchback of Notre Dame or Small Soldiers (1998), making your good guys ugly still amounts to a subversive act. Still, we think, Bell may look like a wreck, but surely she will win us over with her caustic wit, or by saving a cat? Nope. The kindest thing she does is give a handjob to a terminally ill man, and even then it is not an act of charity but a peculiarly sordid way of wringing a name out of him.While Melissa McCarthy isn’t as conventionally glam as Kidman, she brushes up nicely for chatshows and red carpets. So it is a little disconcerting to see her in a dowdy wig and unflattering specs in Can You Ever Forgive Me? She plays the real-life writer Lee Israel, whose career had slumped so much by 1992 that she began to support herself by forging literary letters and selling them to dealers. Even before the opening credits are over, this prickly, self-pitying alcoholic has already told a work colleague to “fuck off”, and stolen an overcoat and two rolls of toilet paper at her agent’s party.While Israel doesn’t save a cat, she does share her apartment with one her criminal career is launched when the animal gets sick and she needs money to pay the vet. This definitely makes her more relatable, and it is hard not to sneakily admire her refusal to clean up her act and play the literary game (unlike Tom Clancy, whom she dismisses as a “jackass”). McCarthy makes us feel for her without softening her anti-social abrasiveness, but likable? Hell, no.Like Destroyer, Can You Ever Forgive Me? was directed by a woman – Marielle Heller. “Lee was flawed and complicated and fascinating,” Heller told Variety. “If she were a male character, nobody would bat an eye, but because she’s female, it feels radical.” The screenplay was co-written by Nicole Holofcener, while The Favourite was co-written by Deborah Davis. Many people say (see what I did there?) that one result of getting women’s voices out there, making more movies, means that audiences will get used to seeing female characters who are less likable, more human. And who knows? Maybe one day they will stop expecting female politicians to be likable, too.Destroyer is released on 25 January Can You Ever Forgive Me? on 1 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15220ba2ae5bbb660ebcaaa52a2d1d42273c856b/395_206_4735_2841/master/4735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0599c672fbae29b87737ca094770633","title":"jannik vestergaard interview southampton hasenhuttl staying up going down","story":"The Southampton defender talks about the ‘indescribable’ pleasure of surviving the drop, life under Ralph Hasenhüttl and his grandfather’s time at West HamJannik Vestergaard describes it as a worry that never goes away, the heaviest of responsibilities, a shadow, something that gnaws at relationships, testing them, redefining them. The Denmark centre-half has stared into the abyss of relegation at two of his previous clubs, Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen, and now he must wrestle with the same emotions at Southampton. Yes, football is a sport, a job, he tells himself. But he knows it is so much more.“Staying up or going down – it affects your life, hundreds of people who work for the club and the fans at the stadiums,” Vestergaard says. “I have met only a few players who can leave it all in the dressing room.“So a bad game, a series of bad results – it has an effect on your personal life and it is tough to be around us. I’m sure my family and my wife could sign that. I mean, what Werder Bremen is to the city of Bremen – it is everything. When I’d be out walking my dog, the importance for the whole area, you could feel it. And it’s the same here in Southampton.“There are a lot of emotions other people’s emotions, too. You put it in a backpack and you carry it around with you. Am I doing it at the moment? Everyone is, I think. The players and staff would be lying if they said that they didn’t.”Vestergaard, who joined Southampton from Borussia Mönchengladbach last July for £18m, speaks in flawless English – his third language, behind Danish and German – and has a perspective and conviction that belie his 26 years. Like every football fan in Denmark, Vestergaard grew up watching the Premier League and he dreamed of playing in it. The reality has been bracing. Vestergaard now has a new manager in Ralph Hasenhüttl and 17 games to haul Southampton on to the right side of the relegation cut-off. The mission resumes at Leicester on Saturday.By Vestergaard’s own admission, he has yet to show his best form. Dropped by the previous manager, Mark Hughes, in early October for seven weeks, he started Hasenhüttl’s first game at Cardiff on 8 December and made the error that led to the only goal. Yet Hasenhüttl kept faith in him for the next match at home to Arsenal and Vestergaard played well in the 3-2 win. There have since been further flickers from him, most notably in the 0-0 draw at Chelsea. Vestergaard senses that things are picking up.“What I was most happy with was the trust that the manager put in me after Cardiff,” Vestergaard says. “He let me play against Arsenal and it’s those moments when you really have to pay it back and I think I did. I have been struggling, along with the team, to find that level I know I can produce but, especially since Cardiff, I have found a good rhythm. Hopefully, I can build on that.”Vestergaard played for Bremen and Mönchengladbach against Hasenhüttl’s Ingolstadt and RB Leipzig teams and, in six Bundesliga meetings, he drew two and lost four. It is not necessary to mention the head-to-head. Vestergaard already knows it because he has a laser-like memory for match detail.Vestergaard says that the keys to winning a relegation battle are “balls and keeping calm”. He speaks from a position of authority, having been a part of two dramatic escapes, the first of which came at Hoffenheim in 2013. Vestergaard’s team had needed to win at Borussia Dortmund on the final day and hope that Fortuna Düsseldorf did not in order to reach a two-legged relegation play-off and nobody gave them a prayer.Jürgen Klopp, the then Dortmund manager, started with the same XI he would use in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich the following weekend and they went 1-0 up early. Remarkably, Hoffenheim turned it around with two late penalties but Dortmund looked to have sent them down with a last-gasp equaliser. The referee gave the goal only for his assistant to then disallow it for offside.Düsseldorf lost at Hannover and Hoffenheim advanced to the play-off where they would beat Kaiserslautern, with Vestergaard heading the clinching goal in the second leg. Three seasons later, he was involved in another last-day showdown, when his Bremen team had to beat Eintracht Frankfurt to stay up. Draw and they would have entered the play-off lose and they might have gone down. They won 1-0 with an 88th-minute goal.“My goal against Kaiserslautern is probably still the best moment of my career,” Vestergaard says. “I said that I didn’t know how it was to win a championship, the World Cup or a Champions League but I would have a hard time thinking it could be a better feeling than the one we had then. Staying up is indescribable but I’d rather not go through the buildup.”Vestergaard has a Danish father, a German mother and football in his genes. His mother’s father and brother played at a high level in Germany, with the former, Hannes Schröers, also turning out briefly for West Ham’s youth team. “It was the mid-1950s and he did it in connection with becoming an English teacher in Germany,” Vestergaard says. “He came to England for a year to learn the language. At that time, football wasn’t really paying. He was a left-back and when he didn’t know what to do, he would play it in deep and the striker, after a couple of long balls, would rip his head off because he didn’t want to run all the time. He’s got stories like that.”Vestergaard has been similarly unafraid to make bold moves. At 15, after falling from favour in the Copenhagen junior ranks, he joined their rivals Brøndby. A growth spurt was cited as the reason for him stalling. He now stands at 6ft 6in and is the tallest outfield player in the Premier League.Vestergaard got back in sync at Brøndby and was offered terms by Hoffenheim, which he accepted, even though it meant moving to Germany and living alone at 17. The club was the making of him and he reflects with fondness on his four and a half years there, despite a falling out towards the end with the manager, Markus Gisdol.Vestergaard’s ambition has always burned fiercely. “I was part of the Denmark World Cup squad last summer but I didn’t play and I was angry,” he says. “Had you told me when I was a kid that I’d do this, this and this, maybe I would have taken it but your goals move as you reach them. The World Cup was amazing and horrible. You always want more.”Now what Vestergaard wants more than anything is Premier League survival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5744d8d0e43c1fa94689868d363db0ec486a52d5/926_70_1757_1054/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c99afbf589343545887ab5bfaf949c72","title":"premier league team news transfer updates tottenham manchester united live","story":"Get your West Ham v Arsenal team news here! What kind of reception will Marko Arnautović get from the home fans after his agent said he wants to be allowed to leave andNot surprisingly, Jürgen Klopp has been named Premier League manager of the month for December and Virgil Van Dijk has gobbled up the player-of-the-month gong. A defender has not won the player-of-the-month award since March 2013, when Jan Vertonghen took it home. Look at Virgil, making defending cool again.“Today’s spying row is tremendous fun of course,” writes David Hopkins. “However, how much more fun would it have been had these still been the days of the Clough v Revie rivalry? I’m sure Frank Lampard can raise his voice when he needs to, but imagine what fun Mr Clough would have had with it.” I expect Clough would have stormed into the Leeds dressing room with a stepladder and checked for bugs before throttling Bielsa had he been in charge of Derby . Over to Spain now, where Real Madrid are in danger of not qualifying for the Champions League. It’s unthinkable, right? Well, it would be if they were playing well, but as our Spanish football correspondent Sid Lowe detailed recently, they’re just not very good. Madrid, in fifth, play sixth-placed Real Betis away tomorrow. Betis are breathing down their neck. Solari will probably be grateful that the game is away as the atmosphere at the Bernabéu in recent games has been one of resignation. Madrid beat Leganes 3-0 in the first leg of the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday. But there was still no starting place for Isco despite injuries to key players. Here’s what he had to say about that:“There’s 24 players and my duty is to pick the players. It’s not the most pleasant duty. Why Isco didn’t play today as starter? Today we made a big game.The Betis match is bigger, so we can probably expect Isco to sit on the bench again for that one.Back in 2013, Italian side Genoa suspended one of their coaches after he was found spying on a training session held by city rivals Sampdoria. Luca De Pra, a youth-team coach, was said to be hiding in bushes while dressed in camouflage gear. In a statement, Sampdoria said De Pra was hiding like “Rambo under a tree”. Genoa, who denied any knowledge of De Pra’s activities, won the ensuing match 3-0.A man was arrested ahead of England’s World Cup semi-final against Croatia last summer, suspected of spying on Gareth Southgate’s side. The man was accused of acting suspiciously on a roof, 180 metres away from England’s training base. He was asked to delete panorama photos and then released without charge.Honduras accused Australia of spying on their training session before the second leg of their World Cup 2018 playoff match. “Australia spy on the official training of the Honduras team from a drone this caused discontent amongst the team and its representatives” said a tweet from the Honduran Football Federation. It’s was not the first time Honduras had been spooked by drones. According to Honduran newspaper La Prensa, the national team flew defence drones of their own in 2016 to ensure their training sessions were not spied on. Team news alert! Rafael Benítez has a depleted Newcastle squad as his side prepare to face one of his former clubs. It’s all right Rafa, you’ll have loads of money to sp … oh! Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking about the Leeds-Derby spy row. He said spying on opponents was common in Argentina when he was a young player there: And if you haven’t read Paul Doyle’s defence of Wilfried Zaha over ing accusations, it has quite the intro. Marco Silva is feeling the heat at Everton. Having been told by chairman Farhad Moshiri at the AGM that the club’s position in the league is “just not good enough”, he then had to listen to Everton’s CEO Denise Barrett-Baxendale spell out that the ultimate ambition is to win the Premier League. So is he feeling the pressure then?They have a tough game at home against Bournemouth on Sunday. He also played down rumours that the club was considering a bid for Chelsea’s Michy Batshuayil, who has been underwhelming on loan at Valencia. For us to do something in this moment it would mean another player would leave the club and it is not something in our mind. If you do something it because something has happened in our squad.”Quiz time! Mo Salah was crowned African player of the year this week. Who else won the award while playing for Liverpool? If you know the answer to this, then you’ll get at least 110 in the sports quiz of the week. Will Derby be checking the away dressing room at Leeds for bugs and cameras tonight? In December, Spanish second-tier club Granada were accused of spying on opponents after a number of cameras were found hidden in smoke detectors in their stadium. According to El Mundo, the club blamed their former director of operations for planting them. Like Leeds, Granada are top of the second ision. Hmmm. Thanks to @maxbluer for pointing me in the direction of this.The EFL have released a statement about spygate saying, well, not very much really.  We are aware of the reports in relation to an incident at the training ground of Derby County. It is, of course, up to Derby County as to how they progress this matter but as of yet we have received no complaint or contact from the club.Confirmed transfer move alert! As David Hytner reported on Wednesday, Manolo Gabbiadini has joined Sampdoria for £10.8m after successfully coughing for the doctor. Come and get your team news! Especially if you want an idea of how Liverpool will line up at the back against Brighton (spoiler alert: Sturridge probably isn’t going to play alongside Van Dijk unfortunately). Back to the Leeds-Derby spy row. We know Marcelo Bielsa has a ridiculous level of attention to detail, but does he, or his team of coaches, have a history of spying? According to this piece in The National, as a young coach Bielsa had a teenager scramble up trees to gather information on opponents for him. Thanks James. So Maurizio Sarri has had a lot to say this afternoon. Away from his beef with Bayern over Callum Hudson-Odoi, he has spoken about more possible transfer ins and outs at Chelsea. Sarri declined to comment on persistent links with his former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain, who is on loan at Milan from Juventus. He did say if Alvaro Morata leaves, with loan moves to Sevilla and Atletico Madrid mooted, Chelsea would need a replacement.Of course, if Morata will go to another club we need a replacement. It’s normal. At the moment Morata is here, so I think he has to think only to play. Because in this moment in Europe there are 300 players involved in the market and they need to think only to the next match otherwise it’s impossible to play.”And on Willian, who was on Thursday linked with Barcelona, he said:Willian for us is really very important. I think it’s impossible to lose him in January.Sarri added Cesc Fabregas was not in a psychological condition to play, with his move to Monaco yet to be completed. Ruben Loftus-Cheek (back) is out and Morata (hamstring) is doubtful for the match with Newcastle.And with that largely unedifying slice of transfer non-news, I shall pass you back to Gregg Bakowski for your afternoon session. Cheers!Not to underrate or undermine Ralph Hasenhüttl’s scouting but, given his limited time at Southampton, it’s fair to say any new signings arriving at St Mary’s this month are likely to be Bundesliga based. One player Saints have been linked with his Borussia Monchengladbach winger Patrick Herrmann exactly the sort of fast, dynamic footballer Hasenhüttl likes in a team with not much width and has only made three league starts this season. Anyway, the 27-year-old’s not for sale, according to ‘Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl. Patrick stays. It’s too late for a transfer now, considering how early the second half of the season starts. Additionally, in Ibrahima Traoré and Fabian Johnson, we have two players on the wings who both have minor injuries.More from Maurizio Sarri, who wants Chelsea to sign two players this month but hasn’t stated which positions. Think it’s fair to say at least one of them is a striker... As you know very well I am not involved in the market. I spoke with the club and the club knows very well my opinion. In my opinion we need two players. Then it depends on the club decision. I don’t know anything about the market day by day or minute by minute.Some further detail from the Press Association on the spying row which, while all very serious, makes for a brilliant tale...Derbyshire Police attended County’s training ground on Thursday after a man was seen at the perimeter fence of the Moor Farm complex.A Derby statement read: “Derby County Football Club can confirm that officers from the Derbyshire Constabulary were called to the Derby County training centre at around 11:20am on Thursday 10th January 2019 following reports of a man acting suspiciously outside the premises. “It has since been confirmed to Derby County that the inidual concerned is an employee of the footballing staff at Leeds United Football Club. “The club is now in discussion with Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident. At this time no further comment will be made.” Earlier a Derbyshire Police statement had confirmed a man was removed from a position near the club’s training ground. It read: “A man was found at the perimeter fence of Moor Farm training ground and spoken to. Officers conducted routine checks which were all above board. “Despite media reports, no damage to the fence was found, and the man was stopped outside the grounds. No arrests were made and the man was sent on his way.” Maurizio Sarri doesn’t look an overtly happy man at the best of times but the Chelsea manager appears to been left truly cheesed off by Bayern Munich’s pursuit of Callum Hudson-Odoi. Bayern’s offers for the teenager winger have extended to £35m with sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic admitting on Wednesday that: “He has qualities that fit our game. He can dribble, he is fast, he moves well towards the goal. He is a young player who has great potential to evolve.”I think that it’s not professional, because they are talking about a player under contract with Chelsea. So they didn’t respect our club, I think.Stephen Ganavas was our man at the Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum Stadium in Dubai as Australia beat Palestine 3-0.Returning to Spygate, it *seems* Leeds, or at least the city of, has previous with this sort of thing. Ian Fleming’s inspiration for James Bond was drawn from four real-life spooks, three of which had strong links with Yorkshire. As this piece in the Yorkshire Evening Post details: “Geoffrey Appleyard and Graham Hayes came from Linton on Wharfe, near Wetherby, while Gus March-Phillipps was educated at Ampleforth College, near York.” Burnley fans! Fulham fans! Fantasy Football fans looking for some team news! Any fans! Here is a match preview for you...And the big ol’ lad that is Southampton defender Jannik Vestergaard in conversation with David Hytner on the implications, beyond just being a bit rubbish, of Premier League relegationJürgen Klopp has also been discussing Liverpool’s FA Cup exit to WolvesAfternoon all, and thanks Greg. Some housekeeping to kick off with as Australia have just beaten Palestine 3-0 in the Asian Cup having lost their first game of the tournament to Jordan. The Socceroos play Syria in their final group match on Tuesday. I’m heading for some lunch now. So I’ll leave you in the capable hands of James Piercy for 30 minutes or so. According to reports, the “spy” escorted away from the perimeter of Derby’s training ground by police had binoculars, a change of clothes and pliers. But no bucket. That’s a lot of effort to find out whether Harry Wilson is injured or not. The spy row rumbles on. Derby have claimed a man escorted from the perimeter of their training ground by police on Thursday after “acting suspiciously” was an employee of tonight’s Championship opponents Leeds. “The club is now in discussion with Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident,” said a Derby statement. Perhaps having seen Manchester City beat Liverpool after Pep Guardiola lavished praise on the league-leaders, Chris Hughton has decided to try a similar glowing-tribute tactic before Brighton take on Jürgen Klopp’s side.Brighton will be without midfielder Bernardo (hamstring) and winger Jose Izquierdo (knee), while goalkeeper Mat Ryan and winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh are on international duty at the Asian Cup.What about Alessio Da Cruz’s loan move from Parma to Spezia huh? You can keep up to speed with hipster transfer moves like this one, as well as mainstream offerings, in our shiny transfer interactive here. Philippe Coutinho scored his first goal – from the spot – for Barcelona since October in a 2-1 Copa del Rey first-leg defeat at Levante on Thursday night. He has fallen out of favour in recent La Liga games with Ernesto Valverde preferring Ousmane Dembélé as a left-sided attacking midfielderforward. This has caused much chuntering from Barcelona fans about how much value they are getting out of Coutinho for the £142m Barça lavished on him. It doesnt sound like he’s immediatly going to be sold, mind. Here’s Valverde speaking about him after the match: When Dembélé wasn’t playing, everyone was asking me about him. Now Dembélé’s playing and Coutinho isn’t and the reverse is happening. When you do not play and you are not happy, you have to fight to change the situation. Today was a match for that. Coutinho is a great player who has given us a lot and will give us a lot. I will say the same about Dembélé. It’s a repetitive question with interchangeable names.”Here’s Paul Wilson on why David Wagner still believes Huddersfield can stay up: Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has said he “wouldn’t sell” Callum Wilson “at any price”. The striker has been linked with a £50m move to Chelsea but Howe doesn’t even want to entertain the idea of his top scorer leaving for Stamford Bridge, even if he was offered the moon on a stick for him.  I’ve been told about the speculation, it’s not something I seek to read. It’s a waste of time for me to do so. It’s business as normal, Callum has been bright and bubbly this week so no problems there. In my opinion, and it’s just my opinion I wouldn’t sell at any price but I’m the manager of the team trying to create the best team that I can. We desperately want to take the team forward and to do that we have got to keep our best players. Nathaniel Clyne could make his league debut for the Bournemouth against Everton on Sunday but £19m signing Dominic Solanke is still recovering from a hamstring injury. Wilson, Joshua King and Ryan Fraser will undergo late fitness tests.It’s officially lunchtime (in the UK). So here’s something for you to read while you chomp on that sandwich. The general gist is that Ole Gunnar Solskjær will have to up his tactical game to get one over Spurs.After every major tournament it appears that Carlos Queiroz has flirted with the idea of leaving Iran due to meddling from the Iranian FA, but after the Asian Cup it seems like he really will be calling it a day. He said before the tournament “we must be protected from crocodiles”, which suggests he’s either not very happy with the background noise at Iran or that there was an unexpected influx of aquatic reptiles into UAE. Anyway, according to reports in Spain, he’s set to take the Colombia job. It’ll be interesting to see what he can do with that squad given how well he has done with players who have limited ability at Iran. Here’s Jürgen Klopp on his defensive options. He seems a little more optimistic about Matip’s fitness than I thought he might be: Robert Huth has taken a large jug of cold water and poured it all over speculation that he may be about to return to competitive football. He also found room in a short tweet for a what I think is a sly dig at Andy Murray:A blow for West Bromwich Albion’s promotion push! Leicester have recalled Harvey Barnes from his loan deal. Puel had intended to leave Barnes on loan all season but he has been impressed by the forward’s nine goals in 28 games and with Puel’s job seemingly in the balance, he might need Barnes to bring some of that form into Leicester’s forward play.I’m sure people on the internet would have nothing to say about that Hubert. Surely hiring Mauricio Pochettino would be evidence that Ed Woodward has finally twigged that Manchester United need a manager with a long-term plan. As for Solskjær, if he continues as he is doing, he will probably not be managing Molde next season. But I doubt he will get the United job either. Lovren’s absence leaves Liverpool in a little bit of a pickle defensively before they face Brighton. Joel Matip trained for the first time yesterday so is unlikely to be fit enough to start alongside Virgil van Dijk. The likelihood of Jürgen Klopp throwing 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever into the centre of his defence is unlikely, despite his impressive debut against Wolves. So, that probably leaves Fabinho as the most sensible choice in a back four. Liverpool had a similar crisis before their match against Brighton last season, when Klopp reverted to three at the back with Emre Can, Gini Wijnaldum and Dejan Lovren. Liverpool won 5-1 that day despite Wijnaldum admitting he “didn’t know hat to do”. It won’t be as easy as for Liverpool this time. Brighton are hard to beat at home. They’ve only lost to Spurs and Chelsea in the league at the Amex. The decision to let Nathaniel Clyne leave on loan appears a bit hasty now. A couple of bits of news about Dejan Lovren now. Firstly, he won’t be fit for Liverpool’s match at Brighton this weekend because his hamstring is still twanging. And secondly, he has been banned by Uefa for one international match for being a bit gobby on Instagram.Here’s the story from Reuters: Dejan Lovren has been banned for one international match over comments he made on social media about opponents Spain following his side’s 3-2 Nations League win in November. Lovren posted a video on Instagram where he appeared to brag about elbowing Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and made insulting comments about the Spain team following the game on March 15. He also told reporters after the match that Spain were “rude on the pitch” and bad losers. Uefa said that Lovren had fallen foul of a clause in its disciplinary rules which penalises anyone “whose conduct is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rule s of decent conduct.” He was suspended from Croatia’s next Uefa competition match, which is the Euro 2020 qualifiers at home to Azerbaijan in March. Despite the win, Croatia finished bottom of Group A4 after losing their final game to England and were relegated to League B of Uefa’s new competition. Ben Fisher has written this piece on Sheffield United captain Billy Sharp who, on New Year’s Day, scored his 220th league goal in 496 matches. That’s some record. Here’s the interview:It’s fair to say Neil Warnock finds the January transfer window bloody annoying. Actually, he finds everything bloody annoying. In his press conference to preview the Huddersfield game he said he doesn’t blame Nathaniel Clyne for joining Eddie Howe and Bournemouth ahead of Cardiff as he would have done the same. But he would have liked a phone call so that he could have had a few other irons in the fire. The latest players who look likely to slip from his grasp are Nice midfielder Adrien Tameze Marseille winger Clinton N’Jie. He came out with this zinger a few moments ago: The transfer window is like climbing a mountain with butter on your hands. One day you think you are there and then you slide back down. LLLLLLLLL. That’s Huddersfield’s sorry form, right there. They’re on a club-record run of nine consecutive defeats and face Cardiff on Saturday. With Manchester City following their trip to Wales, they need a result or that run will stretch to 11 losses by next weekend. But David Wagner says he doesn’t fear the sack. David Wagner does not fear for his job despite Huddersfield starting the new year rooted to the foot of the Premier League table.It’s not about fear, it’s about that I’m not happy, which is how I should be after all these results. It’s about how I feel responsibility. I like to put smiles on people’s faces like we have done over the last three years and a couple of months. I’m not able to deliver this and this is nothing that satisfies me and this is what I meant when I said I know and I feel the responsibility for it. I can’t ask for more support than I have had from the board, especially from Dean our chairman.” Huddersfield are right to back their manager aren’t they? No other manager in the Premier League could have got Huddersfield promoted as Wagner did. If they go down, which they probably will, they will have the best man in charge to attempt to get them back up.as they most probably will do, go down.They can’t score goals. that’s why the forward Jason Puncheon has joined on loan from Crystal Palace and is expected to make his debut against Cardiff. But Wagner refused to comment on speculation that Leicester have turned down a bid for striker Shinji Okazaki.Midfielders Aaron Mooy, Danny Williams (both knee) and Abdelhamid Sabiri (collarbone), plus defender Tommy Smith (hamstring) are still out.It is 10 years to the day since “the next Zidane” Yoann Gourcuff appeared to have the ball on a string as he scored this beautiful goal for Bordeaux in a 4-0 win over a PSG team that were yet to be fuelled by Qatari cash. Just look at his feet!“The next Zidane” is at Dijon now, where he has’t played a game all season. Guess, who’s back, back again? Paul Pogba, that’s who. He’s recovered from having Jonjo Shelvey’s studs introduced to the back of his leg and he is fit to face Spurs. The Frenchman missed last weekend’s FA Cup win over Reading but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes the midfielder is bang up for a return to United’s midfield at Wembley on Sunday.In other United injury news, Marcos Rojo has returned to his native Argentina as his injury is taking longer to heal than anticipated, while Chris Smalling (foot) is a doubt and Eric Bailly completes a three-match suspension.If you want some live football on a Friday morning (in the UK), look no further than Palestine v Australia in the Asian Cup. Our man Down Under, Jonathan Howcroft, is liveblogging it. The Socceroos lost their opener to Jordan, so it’s a crunch game for them. Where’s Scott Chipperfield when you need him? You can follow it here: Predicting what Leicester will do from week to week is nigh on impossible. They’re seventh in the Premier League, which is exactly where they should hope to be, but fans – and the Leicester hierarchy – do not appear overly enamoured with Puel’s style of football or the fluctuating results. They will be grateful to have a home game against Southampton this weekend who, despite having an upturn in fortunes since Ralph Hasenhüttl took charge, have no senior strikers available. Danny Ings and Michael Obafemi have hamstring problems, while Charlie Austin has been given a two-match suspension for flicking the V sign at Manchester City fans, which must have really, really hurt their feelings.Thomas Müller has been banned for both legs of Bayern Munich’s last-16 Champions League tie with Liverpool after doing a fine impression of Bruce Lee in a challenge with Ajax’s Nico Tagliafico. Funnily enough, he was shown a straight red card. Müller claimed he didn’t mean it. He may be right – but just look at the state of this picture: So who will be the next Nottingham Forest manager then? Here’s are the odds: Jokanovic is the clear favourite, and his recent experience of taking Fulham up to the Premier League last season is clearly the reason why. With Forest only four points off Derby in sixth, promotion is still very much on the table this season. But he turned down the chance to speak to Stoke about the job there this week – so might he not be ready to take on another challenge yet? Forest fans, who would you go for?The Premier League weekend kicks off on Saturday with a tasty London derby as Arsenal travel to West Ham. The Gunners are in much ruder health than their hosts, though. Arsenal manager Unai Emery has six players back in contention for the match. The Gunners can call on fit-again Mesut Özil (knee), Laurent Koscielny (back), Hector Bellerin (calf), Konstantinos Mavropanos (groin), Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal (both hamstring) if required at the London Stadium.As for West Ham, well Fabian Balbuena is the latest addition to Manuel Pellegrini’s lengthening long-term injury list. The Paraguayan defender resumed training this week after a knee problem but suffered a setback and has now undergone surgery which will rule him out for up to eight weeks. And will Marko Arnautovic play after his agent (who happens to be his brother) claimed the striker wants to move to China to “win titles”. Jack Wilshere, Manuel Lanzini, Carlos Sánchez, Andriy Yarmolenko, Winston Reid, Javier Hernández and Ryan Fredericks are all still injured, although the latter pair are due back in training next week.If you like John le Carré novels and Championship football then this story will be right up your street. Derbyshire police believe they may have helped Frank Lampard’s team in their efforts to beat league-leading Leeds by stopping a suspicious person (who may or may not have been reading a newspaper with two holes cut into it) from spying on a Derby training session. Here’s the Press Association story:Derby’s preparations for Friday night’s Sky Bet Championship showdown with Leeds were disrupted by a suspected spy. Police say they attended County’s training ground on Thursday after a man was seen at the perimeter fence of the Moor Farm complex.Derbyshire Police tweeted to say they had located and removed the man amid suspicion he was attempting to spy on Frank Lampard’s squad. The tweet from the Derby Response Unit of Derbyshire Constabulary read: “Officers have just attended the Training Ground for @dcfcofficial after a suspicious male was seen at the perimeter fence.“Excellent searching conducted and male was located. All checks above board! Keeping the team safe to bring home a win against #LUFC on 11th! #SpyingIsCheating.”The big match this weekend is undoubtedly Tottenham v Manchester United at Wembley, where Mauricio Pochettino will get to have a good look at the team he reportedly could inherit if he wants the job at Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskjær can understand why the Spurs boss is being heavily linked with the United job – “The speculation is there for a reason, because he’s done well” – but could another resounding win for Spurs over United convince Pochettino that his long-term future still lies at White Hart Lane (if the stadium is ever finished, that is)? Our columnist Eni Aluko believes Pochettino should stay at Spurs and try to make history. Do you agree with her? One thing for certain is that United are a much more vibrant team than the Spurs side they thrashed 3-0 at Old Trafford in September, and it will be interesting to see how Solskjær’s rampant side – they have won five from five since he took charge – fair in their first real test since he took over. Is Willian off to Barcelona in exchange for Malcolm and some cash? Here’s the Rumour Mill on the latest attempt by the Spanish champions to prise the Brazilian away from Stamford Bridge: It’s Friday and another feastrudimentary meal of football awaits us this weekend. With Spurs playing Manchester United on Sunday and Manchester City taking on Wolves this Monday, Liverpool can extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points if they beat Brighton at the Amex on Saturday. As ever, we’ll bring you the choice quotes from the pre-match press conferences for the Premier League games, team news, the latest transfer tittle-tattle as it lands and more. Here’s the weekend’s fixtures in the English top flight:And there has been some breaking news in the Championship this morning, where Aitor Karanka, who has been under pressure for some time, has asked to be released from his contract at Nottingham Forest. Forest are seventh in the league and their last league outing was a 4-2 home win over leaders Leeds.

Many of the detainees have been cleared for transfer for years.Opened in the weeks following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the prison, which once housed almost 250 inmates, has long been a source of controversy.Although Barack Obama promised to close it while in office, reducing the number of inmates from hundreds to a few dozen, it has remained in operation since Donald Trump, his successor as US president, signed an executive order to keep it open.Obama had argued that maintenance of an detention facility beyond the reach of US law undermined the country’s global leadership on human rights, but Trump overturned that policy in January 2018, saying that he expected new captives would be sent to the prison.Among these is Toffiq al-Bihani, who was tortured by the CIA before he was sent to Guantánamo in 2003. He has been cleared for transfer since 2010.“Seventeen years of detention without charge for many of the men who remain there and a dubious military commissions process at best have resulted in the detention camps at Guantánamo becoming the very symbol of arbitrary detention in the world,” said Dr Asim Qureshi, research director at the UK rights organisation Cage, which counts several former Guantánamo detainees among its campaigners.“As long iniduals continue to be detained there, any calls for human rights by the US will ring hollow.”Daphne Eviatar,director of security with human rights for Amnesty International US, said: “Guantánamo continues to operate as a symbol of Islamophobia that embodies the fear-mongering and xenophobia that defines Trump’s presidency.“Those who are cleared must be transferred immediately, and all other prisoners should either be charged and fairly tried or released, to allow this shameful institution to close permanently.”As part of its efforts to clear the camp, the Obama administration transferred 200 inmates to other countries. However, 40 remain in the prison complex on a small US-run enclave on the southern coast of Cuba, following resistance from the Pentagon and the reluctance of foreign governments to accept the remaining detainees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde6fa7ba60d660afaa6082445c5883738d9bbd8/0_336_5153_3093/master/5153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ea550866b95458a7100bdd004c9d82c","title":"adult milestone survived first year driving coco khan","story":"It’s nothing short of a miracle, given the anger all around meWhere’s a fanfare when you need one? Or, better still, a town crier, because I have reached my biggest adult milestone yet: “Hear ye, hear ye! I have earned my one-year no-claims discount.”It’s been a year since I passed my driving test and I’ve managed to survive without major incident. It’s nothing short of a miracle, given my driving and the nature of Britain’s roads, which serve as both crucial infrastructure and a free forum for acting out anger-related dysfunction.To drive is to travel through a playground of disproportionate rage. I once saw a man become so irate at the car in front for failing to indicate that he lobbed a packet of biscuits at it, screaming: “I should break your neck!”A mixed message, the threat of death and the offer of biscuits. Where, I wonder, did that man go next? Did he slot back into his regular life? Would a camera have followed him as he drove to his job, slipped on some scrubs and then (surprise!) went to work as a surgeon? To think that one day my life might be saved by a Hobnob flinger.Even the most mild-mannered succumb to road rage. I see it in my own gentle partner. Faced by a minor irritant – someone driving slightly too slowly or, even worse, a considerate driver who lets other cars out – the metamorphosis begins. Knuckles whiten on the wheel, cheeks redden, his lips ready to explode.“Imagine if I just ran that car off the road,” he’ll say. “It would be so good.”And I nod and smile, but shudder.Still, I survived my first year. You might even say I excelled at it. Most adult milestones – home ownership, parenthood, financial stability – seem impossible to me. But this model of adulthood, where you’re rewarded by virtue of not screwing up? Now, that I can get behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b989f63333e5b31cd0cbd473873dc8eb472fbe/0_29_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e22287431482c14554d172362eb2ae4","title":"podcast future of education","story":"Submit your questions and ideas to our panel of experts who will discuss what can be learnt from different approaches to educationJoin our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, says:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?On a macro level, should we be trying new methods to engage leaders? Are there aspects of schools and teaching that you believe are outdated? Are there any good alternatives to excessive tests and exams? How can we plan long term or indeed collaboratively within education? How can we better prepare our children for life in the modern world? How can we incentivise more people to teach, and have the space to adopt more creative techniques in their teaching? Looking more locally, what can communities do to change how schools are run in their area – to create a level playing field for children and improve access for those from poorer backgrounds?As Beard eloquently puts it: “In general, I think people don’t fundamentally understand what it means to learn – and to teach. Most policymakers don’t, and I certainly don’t think that people outside of education really do. Our society imagines that teaching means standing at the front of a classroom and talking about ideas. If we want to begin to create a better system, we all need a much deeper understanding of the nature of learning: the science of learning.”To contribute, you can fill in our encrypted form below.

And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit.Hunt insisted there was only one issue causing the deadlock over May’s deal and that was the backstop mechanism, designed to ensure there was no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.He said the deadlock could be broken if the UK gained legally binding assurances from the EU that the backstop would be a temporary arrangement.“Theresa May has said she doesn’t just want words. She want something with legal force.”Hunt joined other senior Conservatives in criticising the Speaker, John Bercow, for allowing MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve’s Brexit amendment in what could ultimately change the course of Brexit.Bercow had been “willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity”, he said.Hunt was speaking after his cabinet colleague, Amber Rudd, said she was committed to ensuring the UK did not leave the EU without a deal.The work and pensions secretary declined three times to say whether she would remain a member of the government if it opted for a no-deal Brexit.Rudd was speaking as MPs prepared for the third day of debate in the House of Commons before the vote on the withdrawal agreement next Tuesday. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, will open proceedings, which are expected to be dominated by the issue of migration.Asked whether she believed the UK could thrive after a no-deal Brexit, Rudd said: “This is a strong and great country, we will find a way to succeed, but I do not think that no deal would be good for this country and I’m committed to making sure we find an alternative.”She said it was right for the government to make preparations for no deal, comparing it with wearing a seatbelt when driving a fast car.But, she said: “I intend to work with colleagues to make sure we avoid it. I am committed to getting the best outcome for this country, which is supporting the prime minister’s deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02d66033ec91b08037359a7e138d74e61e831c5/23_110_3655_2194/master/3655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f27afe021bef5c5afdde86603213cf64","title":"what is going on in brexit and what might happen next","story":"Your no-frills primer to the UK’s departure from the European UnionConfused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part orce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it – or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament – to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d58235381ad139db68270ce8f41b54409d122703/0_41_5169_3103/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07cf66ee27eb00de2ccbd03218a638d6","title":"brexit latest news debate commons jeremy hunt claims commons votes this week have made staying in eu more likely p","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including day three of the Brexit debateThe BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a useful Twitter thread on what the EU might, or might not, do to help Theresa May get her deal through the Commons. It starts here.The Commons debate is now over.Hunt says leave-voting Labour voters will never forgive the party if it uses parliamentary procedures to stop Brexit.Holding a second referendum would undermine trust in politics, he says.Labour’s Jo Stevens intervenes. She asks Hunt if he accepts that the false claims and cheating by the leave campaign in the referendum undermined trust.Hunt says the allegations about broken rules are a matter for the Electoral Commission. But there were false claims on both sides of the campaign, he says.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is speaking now.He says Thornberry confirmed that Labour wants to end free movement. But he says Labour also wants frictionless trade, as if it were still in the single market. Both of those will not be possible, he says.Hunt intervenes again: does Labour want end free movement?Thornberry says, when the UK leaves the EU, free movement will end. What Labour wants after that is a fair migration system and managed migration, she says.In the Commons we’re now on the frontbench winding up speeches. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is speaking for Labour.She says Jeremy Hunt told the Today programme this morning that the government wanted assurances from the EU on the backstop with legal force. She challenges Hunt to confirm this when he speaks after her, and says, if there are legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement, the government should be tabling amendments to the EU Withdrawal Act.But there won’t be legally binding changes to the agreement, she says.She says at various times Hunt has appeared to dismiss a no-deal Brexit as unaccepable, and at other times he has said it might be necessary.Hunt intervenes. He says he has always been consistent. He says he does not want no deal, but he thinks that in the end, even if there were one, the UK would be able to prosper.And Dominic Grieve, one of the few Conservatives publicly calling for a second referendum on Brexit, is also urging Theresa May to delay Brexit, the BBC reports. Grieve was one one of the speakers at the second referendum convention this morning also addressed by Caroline Lucas. (See 1.37pm.)Some cabinet ministers think it is increasingly likely that Brexit will have to be delayed, Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil report in the Evening Standard, because there is not enough time to pass all the legislation required by 29 March. Their report goes on:A backlog of at least six essential bills that must be passed before Britain leaves the European Union has left ministers convinced the timetable will be extended.They include the much-delayed immigration bill.Even asking MPs to sit at weekends and cancel their half-term holiday in February may not provide enough time to avoid asking for a delay, several sources have disclosed.In an interview for the ’s Brexit podcast, the pro-European Conservative Nicky Morgan says Theresa May should give up trying to win the supporter of hardline Tory Brexiters and the DUP and instead try to get Labour MPs to support her deal. According to Christopher Hope’s write-up (paywall), Morgan said:The prime minister will have to decide – and some of us have been urging her for months – she either carries on trying to win over the DUP and some of the hardest Brexiteers in the Conservative party, or she builds a cross party consensus ...Brexit should be a non-party political issue … At the end of the day if we want to deliver this and get the right result for the country then it should be a cross party effort.What we have seen in the past few months is backbenchers talking to each other, that is now in the open because amendments are being signed on a cross party basis.Anti-Brexit campaigners have been speaking in London at an event called The Convention: Another Vote is Possible. One of the highlights was a speech from Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, who began with a tribute to the 17.4m people who voted to leave - “I also want to say a genuine thank you to the 17.4m people who gave the establishment such a well-deserved kicking in 2016” - and who went on to set out a blueprint for running a radical, remain campaign in a second referendum. The full speech is here, and it is well worth reading. Here are the key points.Many people took the question they were being asked to mean “Should the country go on being run in the way that it is?’And they voted “NO!” with a collective howl of rage.That response was justified then - and it’s justified now.For some, it might have been mixed up with fear, even bigotry, and an impossible longing for the past.But there was - and is - a core message at the heart of the Brexit vote.That the status quo in this country is intolerable for huge numbers of people. That the social contract is broken and the power game is rigged.It is right and reasonable to be furious.Changing the Brexit conversation means proudly celebrating free movement - and the opportunities it’s given to iniduals and to our country. It was not just a political failure, but a moral failure, that saw the Remain campaign hide away from talking about migration in 2016 - preferring instead to bandy about economic threats, rather than engage in a serious debate on this pressing issue.It also means making those opportunities of free movement genuinely available to all - when for vast swathes of people today they’re not even imaginable.As inequality spins out of control, people in all classes feel helpless. That’s why the slogan “Take back control” had such resonance.It promised agency in a system in which the rich and powerful, who clearly do have agency, were telling us that the market rules, and there’s nothing anyone can do.In short, this is a country where what dictates your success isn’t how hard you work, or how much you care. It’s not your passion or your commitment.No. This is a country where your success is dictated by your postcode, the income of your parents, the year in which you were born.The 2016 result should tell us that “project fear” won’t win people over.They want hope ...To stand any chance of winning a People’s Vote, we have to abandon all association with a vapid centrism that has failed to deliver for so many people, and would fail again.We have to think and act anew.To start using the ideas and language now that will set the tone for a very different kind of referendum campaign.One that’s hopeful, inclusive, energetic and radical. One we can all feel part of and one that appeals to our hearts as well as our heads.One of the best ways to “take back control” is to rid ourselves of a winner takes all politics, and an outdated electoral system that systematically shuts people out ...And let’s seriously explore ideas like parliament moving out of London to a city such as Leeds or Manchester – with the chance to rebalance our economy as well as our politics.The Palace of Westminster, Gothic, rat-infested, and crumbling into the Thames, has become a powerful symbol of political decay.If we mean what we say about changing this country for good, then why not make moving parliament out of London the first in a series of changes which turn the UK into a 21st century democracy?Let’s learn from the inspiring way in which citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland, for example, to facilitate informed debate on contentious topics and build deep consensus and understanding.And let’s ensure that democracy can no longer be undermined by fake news and post-truth advertising by introducing new ground-breaking digital democracy laws.Here is Channel 4 News’ Michael Crick on what the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey is saying about his telephone call with Theresa May about Brexit yesterday.On a visit to Romania, which currently has the presidency of the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said the EU would be offering the UK “clarifications” relating to the Brexit deal, but not a renegotiation. He said:We are checking with Downing Street what the clarifications could amount to. They should not be confused with a renegotiation.I don’t like the prospect of a no-deal. It would be a catastrophe.Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, has sidestepped a question about whether the party would be for or against Brexit in a general election camapaign. On the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland this morning, he was asked directly about what the party’s stance would be if a general election was to be called. He replied:It’s not a matter of campaigning for or against Brexit. There has been a referendum in which people overall decided that we should leave the European Union and I have said repeatedly that I think the job of elected politicians is to look at the best way of extracting the best deal under those circumstances.Our policy on Brexit so far has been to try to secure the best deal. The manifesto of the Labour party will be decided by the Labour Party and we’ve got a process for determining that. My view is that we had a referendum in 2016, our job has been to try to get the best deal.In response the SNP deputy leader Keith Brown described Labour’s position on Brexit as “laughable”. He said:Labour have proved that they are gearing up, once again, to sell-out the people of Scotland - this time on Brexit. Their members must be in despair. Demanding a general election without a position on the biggest political issue of the day is the height of incompetence. In fact, it’s laughable. Downing Street has responded to Jeremy Hunt’s remarks on Today this morning. (See 9.35am.) A spokeswoman insisted to journalists at the lobby briefing that the foreign secretary had not said parliament would block no deal - but that it would “try very hard” to do so.The default position is that if the deal is not voted for, the UK will leave without one, and the only way to avoid that is to vote for her deal, she added.Asked whether article 50 might have to be extended to allow time to pass all the necessary legislation, either in the event of Theresa May’s deal being passed, or a no deal, the spokeswoman said:We are obviously making progress with the legislation required in either scenario, and we will ensure that either way, we will have passed the necessary legislation - we will make sure the time is made available.Pressed on an extension, she said: “It’s government policy that that’s not something we’re going to do.”The spokeswoman added that MPs could still expect to hear from the EU27 before next Tuesday’s meaningful vote.

The probe is shown adjusting its altitude, speed and pitch as it seeks to avoid obstacles on the ground.Researchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and the birth of the universe’s first stars.The terrain has been observed many times from lunar orbits but never explored on the surface. It is popularly known as the “dark side” because it cannot be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.The pioneering landing highlights China’s ambitions to rival the US, Russia and Europe with its space programme, through manned flights and the planned construction of a permanent space station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da798cb27786230386af3c25dbcf22fa0ba1cab/125_216_2981_1790/master/2981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8540e005d8f317d23364857342e17d45","title":"andy murray tennis world sport tribute","story":"Everyone from Billie Jean King and Greg Rusedski to golfer Justin Rose and Hibs boss Neil Lennon has sent well wishesThe world of sport – from tennis to golf and even a Bundesliga club – have been offering up words of support for Andy Murray after the three-time grand slam winner admitted he will retire this year and possibly even this month.Speaking in the build-up to his first-round match at the Australian Open, Murray said: “In December I spoke to my team and I told them: ‘I cannot keep doing this.

But also look at what he’s achieved, not just the wins but the way he goes about it, his humour, his support for equality, the way he shot down reporters for their comments.”Murray’s sense of humour, most vivid in his Instagram account, is notoriously dry and, at times, has been so understated as to be missed by commentators unfamiliar with this peculiarly Scottish seam of wit. But Murray’s trademark understatement is also what endears him, especially so in Dunblane, a town too familiar with extremes. Both Murray brothers were pupils at Dunblane primary school and in class the day that Thomas Hamilton shot 16 children and one teacher on 13 March 1996.Likewise, in a town that has come to expect some degree of misrepresentation, locals appreciate his authenticity: Murray’s passion on the court is real, as are his tears and his mammoth sulks.“He’s an idol,” says Thomson. “He’s left an amazing legacy and he’s done everything he can to help younger players.”Nicola Wishart is playing practice doubles under Josh’s instruction. Her two children, who attend Dunblane primary, also play at the club. “They found out this morning and they were really upset. It’s so sad to see him having to stop before he wants to.”For Wishart, Murray’s impact on the next generation is inestimable: “There’s a really strong coaching programme at the club here and the kids all love it. But across the country now there’s a whole generation thinking they can be great sportspeople, watching Andy and Jamie and feeling that anything is possible.”As the morning coaching sessions draw to a close, Brian Melville, a semi-professional coach who first encountered Murray as a four-year-old, describes the boy he trained regularly at the club from the age of seven: “He was just a winner. He didn’t want to be second, he wanted to win, even at that age. I called it grit and determination.”Murray’s legacy is this: “When you think about Dunblane, you think about Andy Murray.” What is unsaid is the particular resonance of this achievement for a town that was previously synonymous with tragedy.Along Dunblane high street, which curves down the hill from the golden postbox that commemorates Murray’s London 2012 Olympic victory, the affection and appreciation for Murray the man – as much as the player – is evident. “He’s got to look after his health,” says Mairi Ross, serving behind the counter at Fresh As A Daisy laundry. “He’s got to do it for himself and his family.”“He’ll have other opportunities,” says her colleague Lizanne Richards. “He can go into commentating, and there are all these other things he can do. He’s got plenty of time ahead of him.” She pauses: “We just couldn’t imagine it happening to a local boy.”Val Mutch, a volunteer at the Sue Ryder shop, is pragmatic: “Enough is enough. He looked in so much pain and he’s done everything he can. He’ll be sadly missed but I don’t see him disappearing. He still has so much to give.”“He’s been inspirational for the town,” agrees Ellen Hughes, who is organising raffle tickets. “The excitement here when he won Wimbledon, got married, had children, was incredible. He brought so much to Dunblane.”“I also like how he’s championed women in sport,” adds Mutch. “He’s such a fair, good person. He stands up for fairness because he knows he’s got a voice now.”Ellen agrees: “We’ve seen him develop from this wee shy person. He was so awkward at first, especially in front of the media. He’s had to grow up in public.”BBC Scotland’s morning phone-in show posed one question on Friday: “What is your message for Andy Murray?” Callers from Elgin to Eyemouth filled the airwaves with voices choked with emotion, offering fond iterations of the same basic message: “Thank you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c8816690b9e8f93217c9df8a52f77d3884658a/0_50_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bd431ccfa6ea15f83724bbe2da4ae65","title":"johanna konta fit injury brits australian open tennis","story":"Konta and Kyle Edmund lead British hopes in Melbourne but the draw has not been kind and hopes of any second-week involvement do not look particularly strongAs the thin red line of British tennis thickened to a modest eight players in Melbourne on Friday, Johanna Konta, who plays in the first round on Tuesday, was at least favoured to be still standing as long as any of the others.If that is unduly pessimistic, it remains an obvious fact that these are precarious times in an era that has post-Murray written all over it, if the retirement-bound Andy does not get past Roberto Bautista Agut on Monday.Konta, whose path has wavered since she reached the Wimbledon semi-finals two years ago, gives the impression she is better prepared here than she was in the latter stages of her decline towards the end of 2018.The Sydney-born Konta begins her campaign against adopted Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, the world No 45 who beat her last week in Brisbane, after Konta’s encouraging upset of the 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens.“I generally play a handful of players per year and then we do a rotation,” she smiled. “I’m not really surprised. I think it’s a great opportunity for me to play someone I’ve just lost to – who played very well – and for me to try to do better, to immediately learn from how that match went, the things that I could have done better.“She finished her career-high end of last year. So she’s playing some of her best tennis.”Konta, seven places ahead of Tomljanovic in the rankings, says she has recovered from a curious neck injury that forced her retirement in Sydney.“I was warming up and my neck just seized up. I couldn’t turn left and I couldn’t look up so that made it particularly difficult to hit normal strokes and also serve. But I can look up now! It’s pretty much almost completely normal. I can live with this. You don’t realise how much you use your neck until you can’t use it.”More immediately, Heather Watson has a tough assignment on Monday on the other side of the draw against the 31st seed, Petra Martic. Watson gets very few breaks on tour and this match is no exception – although she is in an upbeat frame of mind.Also in her half of the draw are Katie Boulter, who will have to be at her best to get past the experienced Russian Ekaterina Makarova, and Harriet Dart, who came through qualifying in fine form – only to draw Maria Sharapova in the first round. Only an optimist would back any of that trio to advance to the second round.Of the other British players in the men’s draw, Kyle Edmund should be best favoured to advance, although he will find a resurgent Tomas Berdych a formidable obstacle.Like Konta, Edmund had injury problems before arriving in Melbourne, but says his troublesome knee “is just fine” and takes comfort from the fact this tournament announced his arrival at the top of the game a year ago when, despite injury, he reached the semi-finals.Dan Evans has impressed in qualifying and should have enough left to get past the Japanese player Tatsuma Ito – although he will need to play the game of his life to advance any further – unless Denis Istomin pulls off the shock of the tournament by beating Roger Federer.Cameron Norrie carries most form into the draw, reaching the Auckland final by beating Jan-Lennard Struff on Friday after a superb run in the city where he grew up before he opted to play for Great Britain, through his Scottish father and Welsh mother. He reacquaints himself with the young American Taylor Fritz, whom he beat in the quarter-finals in New Zealand – but in his path thereafter, most likely, will be Gaël Monfils … and Federer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c059c653f4f79a9f163dfad606fb51d58254708/0_0_3001_1800/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7b8ff54972706d457f3a5c03be3330","title":"nfl divisional round predictions cowboys saints eagles rams patriots chiefs chargers colts","story":"The NFL’s top seeds make their postseason debuts, and one of last weekend’s winners is more than capable of making an upsetWhat the Colts need to do to win: The Colts aren’t going to be able to stop Patrick Mahomes from scoring touchdowns, so they need to take advantage of the Chiefs’ defense and score on as many drives as possible. Andrew Luck, the comeback player of the year, is quite capable of keeping pace.What the Chiefs need to do to win: Their defense needs to step up. The Chiefs had the second-worst passing defense in the league over the regular season, which could be quite a problem against Indianapolis, who have won 10 of their last 11 games.Key player: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs. In his first full year as a starting quarterback, Mahomes had a season for the ages, hitting marks that only the likes of Tom Brady and Peyton Manning have reached. Now we get to see how he fares in his first playoff game.What the Cowboys need to do to win: Pretend it’s a home game. The Cowboys have lost their last seven road games in the playoffs. The good news? It’s not going to be difficult for them to imagine they’re playing in front of a friendly crowd. The Rams have yet to fully capture LA’s imagination since their move from St Louis and Cowboys fans, notoriously, travel well. There’s a good chance that the crowd’s loyalties will be evenly split.What the Rams need to do to win: Jared Goff has to return to form. The Rams QB had a fantastic start to the season, and his success translated to team success, but he came down to earth later in the season, throwing a career-high four picks in an early December game against the Chicago Bears, and struggling against the Philadelphia Eagles. He won’t be able to afford many mistakes on Saturday.Key player: Todd Gurley, RB, Los Angeles Rams. One of the best running backs in the league, Gurley is still recovering from a knee injury. The Rams expect to balance both him and CJ Anderson during their matchup against Dallas, but if Gurley has recovered, expect him to make a game-changing play or two.What the Chargers need to do to win: Get to the quarterback. While he ended the season with one of his finest efforts of the season, Tom Brady has looked human of late and more vulnerable to pressure. Meanwhile, the Chargers may have the best all-around defense of the teams remaining in the playoffs.What the Patriots need to do to win: Keep doing what they’re doing at home. The Patriots have a perfect 8-0 record at Gillette Stadium this season and no team will have benefitted more from the bye week, what with Brady showing some surprising signs of age. Oh, and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has never won a game against Brady.Key player: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots. The Patriots’ playoff success has depended on the health of Gronkowski, maybe the greatest tight end in NFL history. Expect Brady to look for him when his team need to pick up big-time yardage, even though Gronkowski has not had a vintage season by his standards.What the Eagles need to do to win: Once again rely on Nick Foles’s magic. When the Bears’ Cody Parkey clanged the ball off the uprights twice last Sunday, it became tough to deny the fates. What the Saints need to do to win: Take an early lead. How do you protect yourself from a last-minute collapse like the one suffered by the Chicago Bears on Sunday? You throw a few unanswered touchdowns early and give your solid defense a chance to hold the line. Drew Brees can do just that.Key player: Cam Jordan, DE, Saints. Jordan is arguably the Saints’ best defensive player, certainly their most reliable one in terms of staying on the field. He leads the team in sacks and getting to the quarterback could be a major deal this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d1fe8b0aea53902855f83a6ed02f5d82017fae/0_102_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d37853506f9ade4eff690ed29f46e8c0","title":"hamilton musical puerto rico joyful homecoming but complicated","story":"Musical is iding residents on island where creator Lin-Manuel Miranda spent childhood summersJavier Ortiz likes to look on the bright side in San Juan, the pretty and gritty capital of Puerto Rico. “I’m an optimist,” he says. “I’m the owner of a bookstore, so I have to be.”Ortiz has survived not only the onslaught of Amazon but also Hurricane Maria, which forced him to close for 10 days then manage the store without electricity – running a cash machine off a battery – for two months. Now, as the debt-ridden island finally gets an event to celebrate, the 50-year-old has one of the golden tickets.The mega-hit musical Hamilton opens in San Juan on Friday night. Ortiz’s wife, Huarali, queued for 10 hours to get $150 tickets for them and their Hamilton-mad sons: Alejandro, 12, and nine-year-old Nicolas. “It is expensive: we’re having to make a sacrifice,” says Ortiz. “We will keep working hard and make a better island and better country. Hamilton’s a good sign but the hard work we will have to do ourselves.”With a score mixing hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R\u0026ampB and Broadway, the show dramatises the life of Alexander Hamilton, a Caribbean immigrant who becomes an American founding father and the first treasury secretary, only to be wounded by scandal and die in a duel. It has swept awards shows and conquered cities across the US as well as London, but its arrival in the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico was always going to be special because of its composer, lyricist and star.Lin-Manuel Miranda, born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, spent his childhood summers on the island. For the two-week San Juan run, which is raising money for arts communities on the island, the 38-year-old dynamo will reprise the title role for the first time since Broadway in July 2016. It will be a joyful and poignant homecoming a moment to savour Miranda’s global success, and a symbol of the island’s slow return to normality after the September 2017 hurricane that killed nearly 3,000 people and caused what is thought to be the biggest  blackout in US history.And yet, this being Puerto Rico, it is also complicated, multi-layered and politically charged. There has been controversy over a last-minute change of performance venue. Some are also reluctant to regard Miranda, born and raised in New York, as one of their own. They are unhappy about his association with Barack Obama and a debt restructuring plan that imposed harsh austerity measures on the territory of 3.3 million people.About 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan, traces of Miranda are inescapable in Vega Alta, an unglamorous town of 39,000 people where his extended family still lives. Its theatre was torn down in the 1970s to make way for a car park, but a small new plaza built by his father includes a bakery, bar, cafe, souvenir shop – hats, mugs, T-shirts, postcards, lifesize cardboard cutouts of Miranda – and a small museum showing off artwork, awards, cast recordings, family photos and theatre programmes. On the walls there are colourful tile mosaics that include Miranda’s face, the Hamilton logo and the Puerto Rican flag. Salsa music plays as tourists snap photos.A short walk away, on a cul-de-sac of single-storey houses where the quiet is punctuated by squawks from tropical birds, is the home where the young Miranda and his sister would while away summers with their grandparents. He would often run over to see his neighbour Margo Rodriguez and enjoy her homemade limbers – a local treat that resembles a popsicle frozen in a plastic cup. “He spent a lot of time with me here, singing, drawing and making jokes,” says Rodriguez, now 85. “I would pretend to play guitar with a broomstick and he would sing. He was a good kid. He was priceless.”She is not alone in her pride. Elliot Knight Nater, a music director, says: “This town loves him. When they know he’s coming here, you can see 200 to 300 people waiting: people who used to see him as a kid running in the streets.” He added: “I hope he never gets into politics because people change as soon as they get in that position.”And yet Miranda’s family is steeped in politics. His great-uncle, Gilberto Concepción de Gracia, was the founder of the Puerto Rican Independence party. His father, Luis Miranda, is a Democratic party consultant who left the island at 18 to chase the American dream and, despite speaking little English, found that New York “fit like a glove”. He settled in a Latino neighbourhood in Washington Heights – the inspiration for Miranda’s breakthrough musical In the Heights, which he brought to Puerto Rico in 2010. Luis Miranda was a special adviser to the New York mayor Ed Koch in the 1980s and helped manage Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand’s successful campaigns for the US Senate.His son has taken on the baton. Accepting a Tony award in 2008 for In the Heights, he waved a small Puerto Rican flag. Hamilton, which celebrates ersity by casting people of colour as the founding fathers of the US, was hailed by New Yorker magazine as “the Obama-era musical”. Its cast delivered a pointed statement to the vice-president, Mike Pence, after one performance, while Miranda has tweeted that Donald Trump will go to hell for criticising the mayor of San Juan after the hurricane. He has also gone to Washington to plead with Congress to help Puerto Rico with its economic crisis and appeared on the comedian John Oliver’s HBO show to rap: “Paul Ryan, I’ll come sing Hamilton at your house.  I’ll do-si-do with Pelosi, I’ll wear my Hamilton blouse.  Your citizens are suffering, stop the bleeding, stop the loss.  Help Puerto Rico, it’s just a hundred miles across.”Amid the Spanish colonial buildings, cobbled streets and ornate balconies of old San Juan, where tourists disgorged by giant cruise ships wander among cats and pigeons, many are expressing their gratitude before opening night. Javier Santiago, 59, the director of the National Foundation for Popular Culture, has a small shrine to Miranda, including the red shirt he wore for the Broadway run of In the Heights, and invites young visitors to try on Miranda’s cap. Some burst into tears. “That’s something they will never forget,” he says.“We feel very proud of the work he did in In the Heights. He showed the soul of our community: the getting together, the importance of family. This is a side that West Side Story never showed. Hamilton coming here is symbolic of the Puerto Rican soul that will never die. He’s in the diaspora that left Puerto Rico to go to the United States his parents brought him back every year and he never lost contact with his roots. The idiosyncrasy, the Latin way of being, is in him, pumping in his heart.”But in Puerto Rico, neither a nation nor a state, where people can vote in US primaries but not in presidential elections, nothing is simple or straightforward. Hamilton was due to be performed at the University of Puerto Rico, where its producers spent $1m upgrading the theatre. Then, late last month, the show was abruptly switched to the Luis A Ferré Performing Arts Center because of concerns about student protests over budget cuts enforced by Washington. The Hamilton set was taken down, shuttled across town and hastily rebuilt.Luis, 64, a former student at the university, was disappointed by the move but endorsed it. “There’s many things that you could compromise but security is not one of them,” he says. “If there is a minimum possibility that anything can happen, that should be enough for the production to move.”But Nelson Rivera, a retired art history professor at the university, accuses the producers of losing their nerve. “I think the government threw shade at the students: ‘Oh, they’re a bunch of terrorists, get out of there.’ They fell for it. They should have won over the community, the university, and nothing would have happened. We’re very nice people.”Rivera, 65, is sharply critical of Obama’s solution to Puerto Rico’s $70bn (£55bn) public debt load, a law known as Promesa that established a non-elected financial oversight and management board – supported at the time by Miranda but disparaged by many as “la junta”. He says: “We don’t really have a government of our own we’re governed by this junta and they’re basically dismantling the country. One of the first things that they started to do was eliminate public education. A lot of public schools have been closed and the university has been really hit hard.“So Hamilton has been used to strengthen the idea that the university is a difficult place that has to be eliminated or at least toned down. That’s exactly what they did when they moved the play instead of keeping it at the university. What is interesting about Hamilton is the way it’s been used for politics.”Rivera, a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, continues: “They call it the Obama-era musical. Give me a break. If Hamilton is anti-Trump, we’re also anti-Obama. For Puerto Ricans, there’s no difference at all between Obama and Trump. So I understand that Obama looks nicer and speaks better but his policies were as terrible to Puerto Rico as Trump’s are. Obama gave us the junta and Trump sent us paper towels. What is the difference?”Ten thousand tickets are being sold for $10 each to residents of Puerto Rico via lottery but Rivera has no intention of trying to see the musical. “There’s a lot of mixed feelings for us. For artists, we have a strong theatre tradition here in Puerto Rico and American musicals are not really our thing. The subtitle of Hamilton is ‘An American musical’ and that’s as American as you can get. So for us, this is not a play that’s meaningful in terms of our culture. It really has nothing to do with us.“Lin-Manuel was raised in the United States. He identifies as an American and when he chooses to do a play it’s about the American experience, not about the Puerto Rican experience. We work with Puerto Rican history and issues and things that Lin-Manuel cannot really know about because he does not live here, he was not raised here nor educated here, so I don’t see how you can talk about something that you don’t really know.”Miranda’s father is aware of the identity politics and does not shy away from them. “The forever debate is who is Puerto Rican,” Luis Miranda says in an interview with the  in the theatre foyer, hours before the first dress rehearsal. “You hear the debate among normal people: ‘But he’s not Puerto Rican, he’s from New York, he’s from Puerto Rican parents.’ But what we do know is that there is enormous pride in him, particularly since he’s so proud of being Puerto Rican. He has said many times that he is using the megaphone and the spotlight that he has gotten thanks to Hamilton to push forward things like the recovery of Puerto Rico.”Luis Miranda also appears to embrace the complexities of his son’s forays into politics, having fought many such battles himself. “I hate Trump and anything I could do to defeat Republicans, even now my friends who are Republicans, I would do because they have allowed the party to be hijacked by this orange nut. When you do that, you know people are going to be with you and people are going to be against you. It’s no different in Puerto Rico, but the important part that I hope I taught my kids is that you make decisions and you take stands and some will applaud you and some will criticise you, but you take the stand you believe is right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

From the spectacular to the controversial – as well as some total tosh – here are 10 of the most memorable products unveiled at CES 2019 last week.After years of promises, the world’s first truly rollable telly is LG’s 65in Signature OLED TV R9. Forget the clunky name, LG finally has a TV that rolls up and out of the way when not in use.Turn it on and the TV extends upwards from the base to offer everything a top-class 4K HDR OLED TV should. There is even a “line view” mode that allows just the top of the television to peak out of the base to show a clock and other bits. The TV supports Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Apple’s AirPlay 2.Expect an eye-watering price tag later this year.Have you ever wished your toilet was able to talk to you? Probably not. But not content with a Japanese-style heated seat and auto cleaning and drying systems, the US toilet maker Kohler has shoved Amazon’s Alexa into its new loo, too.The Numi 2.0 Intelligent Toilet promises a “fully immersive experience” with fancy “dynamic and interactive multicoloured ambient and surround lighting”, built-in speakers and voice control. A snip at about $7,000 – or $9,000 if you want it in black.“Alexa, flush for me.” What could possibly go wrong?What if your smartwatch used you as a human battery so it never needs charging? That’s precisely what the Matrix PowerWatch 2 promises, sucking heat from the wearer’s skin to generate electricity, alongside a hidden solar panel for good measure.Electronic gadgets come in many forms, including tools for pleasure. Although not, apparently, at CES when developed by an almost all-female team using patent-pending technology in micro-robotics, biomimicry and engineering.Osé, an intimate massager that “mimics all of the sensations of a human mouth, tongue and fingers” to feel “just like a real partner”, was originally selected as a CES 2019 Innovation Award honouree but was then dumped and banned from the show for being “immoral, obscene, indecent, profane”.CES’s organisers are now facing accusations of gender bias, given sex dolls for men were launched at the event last year and pornography has been featured in its virtual reality booths for years.Apple, notorious for blocking others from using its technology, has not only started licensing its AirPlay 2 media streaming system to TV manufacturers including Sony, LG and Vizio, but has also announced that an iTunes app will be available on its arch-rival Samsung’s smart TVs.Expect an Apple TV streaming service to launch this year, then.The Korean car company Hyundai has unveiled a car that can walk. The Elevate is capable of both “mammalian and reptilian walking gaits” using four articulated robotic legs that extend out from traditional wheel arches but that can fold back down and drive like a regular car.At least that’s the theory. Experts are sceptical that Hyundai’s “limitless” design will actually work. But if it does, the car that “can climb a 5ft wall, step over a 5ft gap, walk over erse terrain and achieve a 15ft wide track width” will apparently be brilliant for emergency services and rescue vehicles. Not everything at CES requires electricity. Impossible Food launched the second iteration of its meat-free Impossible Burger. It claims its soy-based meat substitute looks, tastes and feels like a beef patty it even “bleeds” and was convincing enough to make one vegetarian reviewer heave.The Impossible Burger 2.0 “delivers all the taste meat lovers crave – without compromise to nutrition or the planet”, according to the company’s COO, David Lee. It is now on sale in a few fast food restaurants in Las Vegas, with a US rollout scheduled for later in the year.Have you ever wished for a Nespresso machine but for beer? LG’s HomeBrew might be the answer to your prayers.Pop in one big and three smaller Nespresso-esque capsules and hit the button. The HomeBrew will then produce five litres of beer from a choice of American IPA, American pale ale, stout, pilsner and Belgian witbier. It even cleans itself at the end.The catch? It takes two weeks to brew ...Bose, maker of world-class noise cancelling headphones, wants to make car journeys silent, using the vehicle’s speakers. Its QuietComfort Road Noise Control system aims to suppress road noise, using a series of accelerometers and microphones to cancel out unwanted sound waves using the vehicle’s sound system.Conventional systems simply pack the doors and floor with insulation but the problem is much bigger for electric cars, which lack the ambient sound of a combustion engine to mask the irritating roar of rubber on road.Science fiction has long been filled with gadgets that automatically apply makeup. At CES, Procter \u0026amp Gamble turned sci-fi into reality with a wand that scans the face and then precisely applies makeup.The Opté Precision Skincare System detects the colour and pigment of skin using a camera, detects blemishes and then covers them with the exact amount of makeup needed to seamlessly erase them. The system prints makeup on to the skin using tiny inkjet-like nozzles.

At our peak, we were highly successful I had a team of 35 people, a £3m turnover and a Covent Garden office. When the agency folded, I decided to invest in bitcoin.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a type of electronic cash that allows people to spend or trade via a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of banks or other intermediaries. It is a cheap, efficient way of transferring funds or holding value, which can be converted back into sterling at any time. I had used it before to buy treatment online for my mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. I had also dabbled with investing in it in 2013, and made and lost some money: bitcoin is prone to sudden fluctuations in value. But the market seemed to have moved on, and I decided it could be a good way to make some profit on my savings.At first I deposited £5,000 at the time, January 2017, bitcoins were about $600, so I bought seven or eight and spent the rest on other cryptocurrencies. But over the next few weeks I became hooked and ploughed in a large chunk of money – £23,000 in all. I remember telling people, “I really think the value of bitcoin could rise to $2,000 this year.” I could never have predicted it would peak at 10 times that. By the middle of spring 2017, my investment had risen to about $300,000, and by the summer it was at half a million. Media interest in bitcoin was growing and friends kept asking how they could get into it, so I started a Facebook group, then a website and finally a podcast devoted to the subject. As excitement built, more and more people got involved, forming the conditions for a bubble but many of us were too caught up in the hype to exercise caution.At the end of 2017, bitcoin had reached almost $20,000 and my portfolio had ballooned to about $1.2m. That is when I got a little out of control. I have always been an entrepreneur, and since I was a kid I had dreamed of buying my local football club, Bedford Town, becoming chairman and getting them into the league. I thought the project might cost £5m, so that was the figure I decided to aim for. I estimated I could get there within six months.By this time I was travelling the world doing interviews for my podcast, taking friends out to expensive restaurants and buying extravagant gifts for my family. I am not the kind of person who puts everything away for the future, and though I donated £6,000 to my local hospital, much of my spending was quite frivolous. It might have been more sensible to buy a couple of houses, but I became overambitious. This felt like my one shot at achieving that childhood dream.At the end of January 2018 the bubble burst and bitcoin’s value suddenly fell. There had been a few drops during 2017 but it had bounced back, so I was not too worried. But over the rest of the year, I watched it sink lower and lower, along with the other cryptocurrencies I had invested in, all the time thinking, “Well, there’s no point selling now…” That was my attitude throughout last year, as bitcoin’s value continued to fall. Pretty much everything I had built up was wiped out.There are many who invested a lot more than I did and ended up with far greater losses. I wish I had taken everything out before the bubble burst, but I do not waste too much time on regret. I have earned money in the past through hard work and enjoyed it more. At the moment, I am enjoying making my podcast, which provides more than enough money to live on. I have sold most of my bitcoin, which is currently worth about $4,000 apiece, to give me a cushion in case the business has a bad month. But if I had to choose between the $1.2m and the podcast, I would let the money go again – I love what I do now.I still believe that bitcoin is a force for good. I recently interviewed Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, who was explaining how it helps people living in authoritarian regimes to prosper – for example, women in Afghanistan who are not allowed to open bank accounts can still work and get paid in bitcoin. It is a step in the right direction. My main focus now is exploring how bitcoin could help stabilise an increasingly volatile world.• As told to Chris Broughton.

But if you can’t get to the internet, there are ways of bringing it physically to you.It’s known as “el paquete semanal” or “the weekly packet”, an external drive loaded with thousands of hours of media content that is delivered to customers by enterprising ‘suppliers’ like Alberto Jorge.“With el paquete you choose what to watch and when to watch it,” says Jorge, 34, as he walks the cracked paving slabs of west Havana delivering the drives.This week’s edition features showbiz news from Spain, Big Brother from the US, and an episode of Celebrity Masterchef broadcast just days earlier on BBC One.Alberto hands a one-terabyte drive to each household to copy, before returning the next day to collect it. He charges the equivalent of two US dollars a week for the service.Upon connecting the hard disk, subscribers are presented with more than 50 folders. There are Spanish-language editions of magazines such as Forbes and GQ, scanned in pdf format, apps that users can copy to their phones, and a file giving offline access to “Revolico”, the island’s main classified website which is intermittently blocked online.While tolerated by the authorities, it is unclear who heads up this hazy enterprise. Rumour has it that a network of entrepreneurs pay database administrators to download content using fast internet connections in their state jobs.On the other side of Havana, Elena Llera, 52, plugs a memory stick with The Bride of Istanbul, a Turkish soap opera, into her television. El paquete is now her main source of home entertainment, and she only switches to state TV for the evening news.Despite having a public wifi park just 100 metres from her apartment – one of more than 700 to have opened since 2015 – she connects only twice a week to video call her aunt in Miami. It costs the equivalent of one dollar an hour to use the internet, around the same as a day’s wage.“If I could, then I’d use the internet for all its functions, to learn about politics and culture. But I can’t. It’s very expensive,” she says.Alejandro Pol, 28, a dentist visiting Elena’s flatmate, uses el paquete to watch Vice News and reviews of the latest iPhones.“We know it doesn’t work like this in the capitalist world,” he says, “but it’s a way we have of staying connected.” For the first time in history, more than half of the world\u0027s population is online. But this source of information is not the same for everyone. When you consider the ways the internet shapes the way we see the world how it affects our idea of reality, these differences are more than digital window dressing — they have the power to influence what we think is true. These illustrations are intended to show how the experience of being online can vary from country to country. They are just a handful of examples. Diverse economic, political and technological conditions mean there is huge range in the quality and freedom of internet access across the world.

Trailing his series This Week, which has to wait to get on air until Bruce’s show is over at 11.45pm, Neil concluded a metaphor about traffic jams with the words, “Honk if you hate Question Time,” an apparent resumption of the bad blood between the Thursday night rivals, for which Neil has been ticked off by BBC bosses in the past.Bruce’s opening link, in which she declared “it’s lovely to be here!”, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show. But her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists - James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - were as brisk and persistent as Dimbleby’s.Bruce could do nothing, though, about the fact that it was a case of new year, new presenter, but same old format and subject matter.The only sign of a tweak to the usual proceedings was that Bruce seemed slightly keener to include the people. “Let’s hear from the audience!” made an early bid to become her catchphrase, those interludes introduced by a firm “Wait a minute!” to the panellists. And wearing distinctive clothing seems to be the trick to catching her eye. She called on “the man in the hat”, and members of the public wearing a yellow scarf and jacket respectively. She was so keen to be inclusive that her pen, waving invitingly at the audience, often intruded in the corner of the shot.But, if the public is going to be more involved in the discussion, there surely need to be fewer than five panellists. Comedian Nish Kumar spent the first 22 minutes draining his water glass, before being invited to make the first of only three contributions in the hour. The other non-Westminster presence – journalist Melanie Phillips – was also called on so rarely that the camera caught her at one point with her head in her hands on the desk.Too many guests faced too few topics. One consequence of Theresa May delaying the Commons Brexit vote from early December was that Bruce was stuck with exactly the same questions as Dimbleby had fielded in his farewell show: Could the PM win and was there a plan B if she didn’t? Kumar lamented that, on his three Question Time appearances in the last year, the questions had been the same each time: “I’m stuck in an endless loop!”The fate of May’s deal occupied 40 of the available 60 minutes, leaving time for only one other matter: the rise in knife crime in London, the city in which Bruce’s debut was taking place.The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.As she moves on to Derby and Winchester in the next two weeks, the problem for the host of Antiques Roadshow may be that she has been handed what was sold as a priceless television treasure but which, on close inspection, looks like a rather faded and wobbly relic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b722c946badc22bc320e9f36fab48f2927581f0c/109_0_3281_1970/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99616885d44dae5e46b1ab08af4f94ec","title":"canada and australia in talks with un to accept saudi asylum seeker rahaf mohammed al qunun","story":"Thai police say several states considering accepting woman who fled alleged family abuseSeveral countries including Canada and Australia are in talks with the UN refugee agency to accept the Saudi asylum seeker Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun who fled alleged abuse by her family, police in Thailand have said.The immigration police chief said on Friday that the UN was accelerating Qunun’s case, but he gave no indication of when the process would be completed.Qunun, 18, was stopped at a Bangkok airport on Saturday and said her passport was seized.

Both TransCanada, which is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline and Kinder Morgan, which was pushing the TransMountain pipeline, have faced fierce opposition from indigenous groups.Much of the current uncertainty surrounds who companies should consult with when they begin to plans projects which would enter indigenous lands.While elected indigenous officials from communities along the route of the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline have signed benefit agreements with TransCanada, five Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs oppose the plan. The chiefs, who are unelected, argue they retain authority over the sprawling 22,000 sq km of the band’s traditional territory.Christie agreed, saying the hereditary chiefs legal claim to rightful control is “airtight”.“The goal has always been the same for Canada and indigenous people: it’s to remove us from our land and have access to the resources,” said Jennifer Wickham, a member of the Gitdumden, one of five clans making up the Wet’suwet’en nation. “That storyline has never changed.”TransCanada says it has had more than 15,000 “interactions and engagements” with indigenous groups as part of the consultation process. The outcome between protesters and police was “not the one we wanted”, the company in a statement.The events of the past week have cast a shadow over the Trudeau’s image of a political leader seeking reconciliation with Canada’s marginalized and often mistreated First Nations. While he lamented the arrests, his government will maintain its course, arguing the resource projects must be built.“Justin Trudeau has said that reconciliation is a priority for him. I would have to say to him, is this what reconciliation looks like?” said Wickham, whose sister Molly was arrested on Monday when police raided the protest camp.The site was first occupied by indigenous protesters in 2009 and now hosts a complex of buildings, including a traditional healing lodge.Freda Huson, who has lived there for nearly a decade said that for generations the community has lost land to farming and resource development and now fears that the pipeline could taint the only available drinking water in the area.“I shouldn’t have to be dragged into the courts to prove that I own land that I know is ours. Our people owned these territories since time immemorial,” she said. Trudeau pledged to overhaul the framework guiding relations with indigenous communities nearly a year ago. But in areas where no treaties were signed, the courts have often become the arbiter of land claims. In 2014, the Tsilhqot’in people in British Columbia won a longstanding battle over title rights at the country’s highest court – but at a cost of more than $10m.Both Huson and Wickham believe Canadian law is inadequately equipped to handle land claims fights with the government.In 1997 the supreme court put an end to one of the longest-running legal battles in Canadian history, ruling that the Wet’suwet’en had effectively demonstrated clear title to their land.The plaintiffs exhausted more than an estimated $25m on legal fees – only to have a retrial called, leaving uncertainty around their claim.“It doesn’t matter which route we take. We took this to the highest court in the Canada and it was ruled in our favour,” said Wickham. “Even when we follow their western law, it doesn’t do us any good.”Both the federal government and British Columbia have pledged to implement the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNdrip).But Christie argues that until there is a fundamental shift in government attitudes, similar feuds will continue erupt.Huson said: “We’re in the right. We’re not doing anything wrong. This is my home. This is my land. They want to break down my door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca1f5ac1921c198cc9ce4d757e1eea07cbb38ea/0_57_3572_2143/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c612a9ffff8e11593c8cb7a25b41ea","title":"syria troop withdrawal under way says us led coalition","story":"Combined Joint Task Force spokesman confirms pullout has begun but gives no detailsThe US-led coalition in Syria has begun withdrawing troops, a military official has said, after days of back and forth over Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a rapid drawdown of the US presence in the country.Col Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said the process of deliberate withdrawal from Syria had started, but declined to comment on specific timetables or movements“Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements,” the Baghdad-based official said in a statement.There were no other details, and it was not immediately clear how many vehicles or whether any troop units had withdrawn.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said the withdrawal began on Thursday night. It said a convoy of about 10 armoured vehicles, in addition to some trucks, moved from Syria’s north-eastern town of Rmelan into Iraq.Confirmation of the first withdrawals comes at a time of confusion over plans to implement Trump’s pullout order and threats from Turkey to attack the Kurds, who have been America’s partners on the ground in the war against Islamic State in Syria. The Syrian Kurdish official Badran Ciya Kurd declined to comment about the withdrawal. Others were not immediately available for comment.There are 2,000 US troops in Syria. Trump’s abrupt decision in December to pull them out, declaring in a tweet the defeat of Isis, sent shockwaves across the region and a flurry of criticism from some of his generals and national security advisers. It led to the resignation of US defence secretary, James Mattis, and the top US envoy to the anti-Isis coalition. It also led to major criticism that the US was abandoning its Kurdish allies while Turkey threatened an imminent attack.On Sunday, the US national security adviser, John Bolton, said American troops would not leave north-eastern Syria until Isis was defeated and that US-allied Kurdish fighters were protected, signalling a slowdown in Trump’s initial order for a rapid withdrawal. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who is on a tour of the region, has also reassured the Kurds that they would be safe after US troops withdrew from the country.“These have been folks that have fought with us and it’s important that we do everything we can to ensure that those folks that fought with us are protected,” Pompeo said of the Kurds while visiting Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, after talks in Baghdad.Having tweeted in December about the decision to bring back US troops “now”, Trump said this week: “We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight Isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary.”Kurdish officials, meanwhile, have demanded clarifications from the US over its intentions. A US troop pullout leaves the Kurds exposed to Turkish attacks from one side and Syrian on the other. The withdrawal benefits the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and his international backers, Russia and Iran, who are primed to move into the region to fill the vacuum left by the US.Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the US was not serious about withdrawing from Syria.She said it appeared to Moscow that the US was “looking for a reason to stay”. Zakharova said Russia had not seen public statements laying out the US strategy in Syria and so could not be sure that the US was serious about leaving.US troops have been involved in Syria’s war since 2014 when the first elite force arrived in the country to advise Kurdish-led fighters in their battles against Isis."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ship held about 150km off west coast by Naval ServiceBird, once a soundtrack to the early summer, now confined to limited number of areasUK and EU had committed to retaining, up to 2027, North\u0026rsquos funding streams first established in the 1990sMinisters respond to concerns that EU exit could lead to dramatic increase in costsToo early to say when hotel on Leitrim-Roscommon border can open, says MinisterBoI will not say how many cards have been restrictedFormer basketball coach accused of 171 counts of sexual assault dating back to 1980sJames Maloney (24) showed woman working at petrol station a wad of cash before opening his trousersEnsuring better intestine absorption key to improvement, according to exhibitionWe are looking for reader pictures of Ireland\u0026rsquos mild winterTemperatures for the winter to date have been well above normalImelda Leahy took money from dead woman\u0026rsquos estate and forged documents, judge notesDawn Croke dies in incident outside school in DungloeDeirdre O\u0026rsquoFlaherty\u0026rsquos car was found at an Inishowen peninsula beach on the day she vanishedDwyer claimed data gathered from his phone should not have been used at his trialExploration of far side of moon hailed as triumph for missionDublin council study finds teens feel excluded from public placesTaoiseach says money on Irish Aid is being \u0026lsquowell spent\u0026rsquoPsychiatric nurses\u0026rsquo union says it will join wave of strikes by nurses next monthDatabase tracking insurance claims will be running by end of year, says Minister"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754689.1547206078!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s so unfair dublin teenagers tell council they just want somewhere to hang out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“When teenagers meet in playgrounds they are accused of loitering, of taking over and of rowdiness.” Photograph: GettyNearly all teenagers want more places where they can hang out with their friends and hardly any of them want more sports facilities in their community, according to a report from South Dublin County Council.The survey shows that more than 90 per cent of teenagers want areas for hanging out and unstructured activity while only 5 per cent asked for more sports facilities.“The results are clear: that providing more organised activities for teenagers is not what they want,” the report states. “Hanging out is seen as a desirable activity in itself and is not a result of having nothing to do.”The report says South Dublin Council Council is proposing a provision of €500,000 in 2019 and a similar provision over the following two years to provide hang out facilities for teenagers.The survey of about 500 teenagers, carried out by the council, found that young people feel excluded from many public places.“When teenagers meet in playgrounds they are accused of loitering, of taking over and of rowdiness. A congregation of teenagers is frequently described as being anti-social when in fact it is usually just normal social interaction. Parents of younger children often see groups of teenagers using playgrounds in a very negative light,” the report states.It adds that teenagers often feel harassed by adults wherever they go and that they feel fast-food outlets and shopping centres provide somewhere they can go to see and be seen and socialise with their friends. The report notes that teenagers have “ample opportunities” to engage in sports across south Dublin. But it goes on to say that what they really want is areas where they can play in a casual manner or casually engage in physical activity.The report recommends creating a series of hangoutmeeting places for teenagers. “The most popular suggestions from the survey were for places to sit and chat and access play facilities such as swings, climbing and zip lines,” the report says. “Teenagers require more vigorous play than younger children so swinging, spinning and anything that thrills is always popular,” it adds.It also recommended creating areas for unstructured physical activity such as all-weather pitches, skate parks and basketball courts. “Generally this is self-directed activity rather than organised sport,” the report says.It goes on to suggest placing cafes in parks. “These would provide a service to all park users but would be particularly beneficial to teenagers as a social outlet,” it says.Proposed projects for 2019 include:-A robust area of activity for teenagers in Collinstown Park in Clondalkin with a goal, basketball net and a large play equipment items, provision of WiFi and seating scattered throughout the area at an estimated cost of €120,000.-Sport facilities in Griffeen Park in Lucan as well as a tea shopcoffee-pod at an estimated cost of €110,000. -A formal meeting place for teenagers in Ballycragh Park in Rathfarnham along with a play spaceactivity area at an estimated cost of €110,000.-In Tallaght, a giant bench has been proposed for Kingswood to act as a formal meeting area for teenagers, as well as other large play type equipment for older children and WiFi provision at an estimated €40,000. A multi-use games area is earmarked for Avonbeg at an estimated cost of €80,000."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754883.1547218909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bradley casts doubt on peace project funding in event of no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland secretary of state Karen Bradley (centre) with young people involved with the work of Youth Action NI during a visit to its offices in Belfast on Friday. Photograph: David YoungPA WireNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has cast doubt on whether £300 million (€334 million) of UK government funding for peacebuilding in the North could be delivered if there is a no-deal Brexit. The secretary of state said the proposed withdrawal agreement provided the “legal basis” to offer the financial support to reconciliation initiatives in a joint-funding model with the EU and Irish Government.In the exit deal, the UK and EU have committed to maintaining, up to 2027, funding streams that were first established in the mid-1990s to support projects in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in the Republic.Asked if the £300 million commitment announced by the government on Friday was dependent on the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, she said: “The legal basis upon which this can be delivered is the withdrawal agreement.“It is set out in there and if we leave the European Union without a deal, we will have difficulties in finding a way that the EU and Irish government can spend money jointly with the UK Government in Northern Ireland on these important projects.”The proposed “Peace Plus” scheme will succeed the current peace programme, which was designed to help promote economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border region.The peace programme has been running since 1995 with funding from the UK, Ireland and EU, and will end in 2020.Last May, the EU set out its plan to make £109 million in funding to continue peace projects post-Brexit.The overall funding commitments, if rolled out, will enable work to continue on the construction of almost £1.8 billion worth of projects in both Northern Ireland and Ireland.Among the projects to have received funding to date has been the £14.5 million Peace Bridge in Derry, which was opened in 2011 and links Derry’s communities across the River Foyle.Youth Action NI in Belfast is one of the organisations that has benefited under the existing scheme.The group used the money to set up the Youth Network for Peace, a regional project involving 10,000 young people in a range of social action projects on a cross-community and cross-border basis.Ms Bradley visited Youth Action’s office in the city on Friday.The Northern Ireland secretary did not go so far as to say the government would stop funding the projects in a no-deal scenario, but she stressed that it would be difficult to find a way to do it.“As a government, to spend public money you need to have a legal basis to do so. The withdrawal agreement sets that out.“If we leave without a deal the question will be how do you legally do these things and I am saying to people we have a way of doing it legally – it’s the withdrawal agreement.“That’s why we should vote for the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday in the House of Commons.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson accuses Downing Street of treating Brexit like \u0026#39a plague of boils\u0026#39Thug tells court his girlfriend is pregnant to avoid jail - but she tells judge from public gallery she is notCongo election runner up claims he won 62 per cent of votePolice and crime commissioner reveals \u0026#39embarrassment\u0026#39 as he is conned by fake TV licensing emailBritish tourists on board deadly bus crash in CubaAmber Rudd demands end to benefit freeze in 2020 in direct challenge to Philip HammondComment: At this crucial moment in our history, why is No 10 pursuing the most bafflingly amateurish PR strategy of all time?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  What does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Lost photographs of Jane Austen\u0026#39s nieces discovered on eBay reveal how author foretold their lives in plots of her novelsHow Donald Trump could save face, restore government and still build his wall  Eight-year-old girl dies as Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon hit by extreme winter weatherBurmese Reuters journalists lose appeal against seven year jail term\u0026#39Parliament and the people do not connect anymore\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s top news storiesAustralia Day: Why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryUS withdrawal from Syria begins after contradictory messages from John Bolton and Mike PompeoBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Previous spacecraft have seen the far side of the moon, but nobody had ever landed on it before.After making a soft landing on Jan. 3 at 10:26 am, Chang’e 4 released a lunar rover to roam and survey its surroundings in the Van Karman crater, the moon’s largest, oldest and deepest one, located in the South Pole-Aitken basin.The pictures show the greatest expanse yet of the dark side of the moonUpon initial landing, the probe relayed an image back to Earth, though Friday\u0027s panoramic photos show a greater swathe of the far side of the moon.China’s successful landing on the far side of the moon is considered an important step in efforts to rival Russia and the US by becoming a major space power by 2030. Next year, China plans to launch construction of a manned space station.People on Earth are unable to see the dark side of the moon While Beijing has said its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US has accused it of pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from accessing space-based assets in a crisis.Targeting the far side, or the dark side of the Moon was a riskier and more complex mission than previous ones – direct communication with the spacecraft was not possible, and unlike the near side of the moon with many flat areas to touch down on, the far side is mountainous and rugged.Watch: The first-ever landing on the far side of the moonThe Chang’e 4 is aiming to complete tasks that include astronomical observation, surveying the moon\u0027s terrain, landform and mineral composition, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment on the far side of the moon.Please review our commenting policyThug tells court his girlfriend is pregnant to avoid jail - but she tells judge from public gallery she is notBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson accuses Downing Street of treating Brexit like \u0026#39a plague of boils\u0026#39Congo election runner up claims he won 62 per cent of votePolice and crime commissioner reveals \u0026#39embarrassment\u0026#39 as he is conned by fake TV licensing emailBritish tourists on board deadly bus crash in CubaAmber Rudd demands end to benefit freeze in 2020 in direct challenge to Philip HammondComment: At this crucial moment in our history, why is No 10 pursuing the most bafflingly amateurish PR strategy of all time?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  What does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Lost photographs of Jane Austen\u0026#39s nieces discovered on eBay reveal how author foretold their lives in plots of her novelsHow Donald Trump could save face, restore government and still build his wall  Eight-year-old girl dies as Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon hit by extreme winter weatherBurmese Reuters journalists lose appeal against seven year jail term\u0026#39Parliament and the people do not connect anymore\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s top news storiesAustralia Day: Why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryUS withdrawal from Syria begins after contradictory messages from John Bolton and Mike PompeoBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Kurdish leaders have seen a deal with Damascus as one possible way of staving off a Turkish attack.The USS Kearsage, an amphibious assault ship, is moving into the region with hundreds of US Marines and helicopters to help cover the American withdrawal, according to the Wall Street Journal. It does not appear at this point that the US military has been given a final date for full withdrawal from Syria and the timeline seems to be part of a broader debate about American strategy in the Middle East. CJTF-OIR has begun the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria, said a spokesman for the US-led coalition against Isil. Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements.”Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson accuses Downing Street of treating Brexit like \u0026#39a plague of boils\u0026#39Thug tells court his girlfriend is pregnant to avoid jail - but she tells judge from public gallery she is notCongo election runner up claims he won 62 per cent of votePolice and crime commissioner reveals \u0026#39embarrassment\u0026#39 as he is conned by fake TV licensing emailBritish tourists on board deadly bus crash in CubaAmber Rudd demands end to benefit freeze in 2020 in direct challenge to Philip HammondComment: At this crucial moment in our history, why is No 10 pursuing the most bafflingly amateurish PR strategy of all time?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  What does a \u0026#39no-deal Brexit\u0026#39 mean - and how would it affect the daily life of Britons?Lost photographs of Jane Austen\u0026#39s nieces discovered on eBay reveal how author foretold their lives in plots of her novelsHow Donald Trump could save face, restore government and still build his wall  Eight-year-old girl dies as Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon hit by extreme winter weatherBurmese Reuters journalists lose appeal against seven year jail term\u0026#39Parliament and the people do not connect anymore\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s top news storiesAustralia Day: Why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryBurns Night 2019: How Scottish favourite haggis could have English rootsWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

The probe is shown adjusting its altitude, speed and pitch as it seeks to avoid obstacles on the ground.\u0026nbspResearchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and birth of the universe\u0027s first stars.\u0026nbspThe far side has been observed many times from lunar orbits, but never explored on the surface. It is popularly called the dark side because it can\u0027t be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.\u0026nbspThe pioneering landing highlights China\u0027s ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space through manned flights and the planned construction of a permanent space station.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

App developers share data with Facebook through the Facebook Software Developer Kit (SDK), a set of software development tools that help developers build apps for a specific operating system.Apps found to be sharing data with Facebook included language-learning tool Duolingo, job database Indeed and flight search engine Skyscanner. A spokesperson for Skyscanner\u0026nbspsaid it had updated its data-collecting practices in the wake of the report.Facebook said that sharing data is common practice for many companies and that it did so in a transparent manner.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It\u0027s also studied objects in our own solar system, discovering some of the tiny moons around Pluto, as well as a\u0026nbsp14th\u0026nbspmoon around Neptune. It takes pictures in both visible and ultraviolet light, as well as near infrared.\u0026nbspOrbiting 350 miles (560\u0026nbspkilometers) above Earth, Hubble was launched in 1990 and visited by space shuttle astronauts, for repairs and upgrades, five times.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbspassociate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen\u0026nbspsaid that such problems were to be expected and that they were being looked over by experienced engineers.Last fall, Hubble stopped working altogether for three weeks because of a pointing problem. This is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handle science operations for the telescope.\u0026nbspNASA is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue, Gundy said Wednesday.\u0026nbspWe would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and NASA is making that happen, even with the partial government shutdown, she added.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our new solution gives operators the ability to take action, said Jean Marc Racine, Synamedia\u0027s chief product officer.Many casual users will be happy to pay an additional fee for a premium, shared service with a greater number of concurrent users.

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

People will choose their provider often because of a cheap introductory deal and then stay for the content offering.“However, you shouldn’t accept getting a bad deal, there are potential savings to be made for those who take the time to haggle and even bigger savings for those who switch.”A Sky spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Just like Which?

I am totally in despair, I don’t think Brexit will happen at all.“The problem is when something doesn\u0027t happen for so long you feel less angry about it.”Their warning came as Jeremy Hunt suggested that MPs would have the power to thwart a no-deal Brexit, leaving parliament with a choice between the prime minister’s deal and no Brexit at all.The foreign secretary said rejecting Ms May’s plan would usher in “Brexit paralysis” with the “possibility in sight” of the UK remaining in the EU.“I’m saying this would be an incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain’s reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found that we weren\u0027t able to do it,” he told the Today programme.Meanwhile, Ms May is scrambling to get her deal over the line by reaching out to Labour MPs and trade union leaders in a last-ditch attempt to win support.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In truth the PM was more equivocal on Wednesday at least.\u0026nbspCertainly when she was asked about an extension by ex-chancellor Ken Clarke, she chose to talk about the position of parliament and her deal more broadly, instead of offering a direct answer.\u0026nbspThen you have the Evening Standard today running comments from a senior minister saying: “The legislative timetable is now very, very tight indeed.\u0026nbsp“Certainly, if there was defeat on Tuesday and it took some time before it got resolved, it’s hard to see how we can get all the legislation through by March 29.”\u0026nbspThe reality of the legislative timetable is hard to escape and the practicalities of it do push you towards the inevitable conclusion that an extension will be necessary.\u0026nbspOne senior Tory told me earlier this week that even if the deal\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspvoted through, the UK may need a few extra weeks grace to get the legislation through.\u0026nbspSo we do seem to be heading towards a later Brexit day than March 29. It increasingly feels like the line from Downing Street that in is “not government policy”, is missing the words “at the moment” at the end of the sentence. \u0026nbspRichard Leonard, leader of Scottish Labour, has refused to say whether his party\u0026nbspwould campaign for or against Brexit in a future general election.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn also refused to answer the\u0026nbspquestion yesterday, saying it would be for the party\u0027s policy making process to decide.\u0026nbspMr Leonard told BBC\u0027s Good Morning Scotland:\u0026nbspIt\u0027s not a matter of campaigning for or against Brexit.\u0026nbspThere has been a referendum in which people overall decided that we should leave the European Union and I have said repeatedly that I think the job of elected politicians is to look at the best way of extracting the best deal under those circumstances.\u0026nbspOur policy on Brexit so far has been to try to secure the best deal. The manifesto of the Labour Party will be decided by the Labour Party and we\u0027ve got a process for determining that.\u0026nbspMy view is that we had a referendum in 2016, our job has been to try to get the best deal.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Through membership of this organisation, however, the country is required to accept the EU’s four freedoms –\u0026nbspincluding the free movement of people.This would of course be inconceivable for many Brexiteers and the prime minister consistently referred to ending the free movement of people as one of her “red lines”\u0026nbspduring the negotiations.EU ‘reflecting’ on how it can give Theresa May more help on BrexitRAF unveils stealth fighter for ‘new era’ of defence after BrexitNo-deal Brexit ‘catastrophic’ for UK food supplies, say farmersCorbyn indicates Labour will back Brexit delay During her recent trip to the G20 in Buenos Aires, the prime minister told reporters: “What we are doing as a government as a whole is looking at producing a set of immigration rules which ensure that the thing we are doing is bringing an end to to free movement”.\u0026nbspIt is clear that a Norway-style model\u0026nbspwould make this impossible, but some of those advocating the option (under the banner “Common Market 2.0”),\u0026nbspincluding the Tory MP Robert Halfon and Labour’s Lucy Powell, suggest it could nonetheless gain widespread public support.\u0026nbspOn immigration specifically they claim new controls over free movement in certain circumstances would be available as the EEA allows members to suspend free movement if a country can demonstrate it is experiencing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.\u0026nbspUltimately, though, it’s hard to see how the UK government could\u0026nbspmake\u0026nbspsuch an extreme argument\u0026nbspand in any case, such a move would only be temporary. This is why many MPs\u0026nbspfrom constituencies that voted Leave (on both side of the House)\u0026nbspare uneasy about backing the model.\u0026nbspIndeed,\u0026nbspErna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, recently pointed out that the UK would eventually have to accept the four freedoms under a model similar to her country, and asked: “Should you leave the EU if you’re accepting that?”“You can’t just opt out of one of the freedoms,” she added.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit. Number one, we keep our £billion — the cost of Theresa May’s deal. That is taxpayers’ money that can be used to boost British businesses.We will be free to enter into new trade deals. We are the fth largest economy in the world.

Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear. They won’t listen to the British people.They want to reverse the result of the referendum by almost any means.No one should believe their blinkered view and this country should not be held hostage by it.Britain has always been a world leader.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street.

I knew for certain that I needed him.“You can’t explain these things scientically.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004611001501.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd hints brits on universal credit could get cash more often","story":"The Work and Pensions Secretary announced that she will oversee a new pilot scheme to pay people moving on to the scheme more frequently - in a win for The Sun’s Make Universal Credit Work campaign.If that change was rolled out across the system it could slash the wait desperate Brits face for their first payment down from five weeks.As part of her new approach to the flagship welfare system she revealed a “more flexible” approach to childcare - helping millions of working parents across the country who struggle to claim their costs back.The Sun has demanded that ministers make vital changes to the system before it’s too late.We’ve told heartbreaking tales of how Brits are drowning in thousands of pounds worth of debt waiting for help, and have had to give up work due to the complicated childcare system.So we’ve called on ministers to let Brits keep more of what they earn, get paid faster and get help for childcare upfront.Ms Rudd will also pump £million of extra money into the troubled programme, and announce that the extension of the two child benefit cap will be scrapped because it is “not right”.That will mean Brits on Universal Credit can keep their benefitsthey have three or more kids - helping , families.Anyone with a third child born after April  did not qualy for extra cash.They were due to extend the cap to Brits on Universal Credit to all third children regardless of when they were born - but this will now be ditched.And she also revealed:“But to really get to grips with the problems of universal credit, the government will need to go further. This means investing more in the benefit so people have enough to live on and don’t have to wait five weeks for a first payment, while also making sure it is paid in a way that works for people’s inidual circumstances.”In February single mum Elise, , who lives near Manchester, moved on to UC and immediately her £ Child Tax Credit weekly payments were stopped, leaving her unable to pay nursery bills for -year-old Lexey and Darcy, .Previously the government had covered around  per cent of her £ a week childcare bills, paying this sum directly to the nursery.Elise, who is currently pregnant with her third child, was able to pay the weekly shortfall of £ out of her monthly £ salary.Under the new system parents are able to claim back up to  per cent of childcare costs - but they must do this in arrears, meaning they need the cash up front to pay the nursery bills.Elise struggled to find the money to pay for her daughters childcare, and when she failed to pay her bills in August, Lexey and Darcy lost their nursery places.I was devastated. Lexey in particular was so settled and really enjoyed going to nursery, said Elise. “Now they are at home all the time, missing out, missing their friends. Its awful, I feel so sad for them.Ms Rudd said this morning: “These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only one in place.“So today I can announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two child limit on Universal Credit before children born before April .”She said the welfare system should reflect British values of “fairness and compassion” and help people who have lost their way.But she will still press ahead with plans to pilot , people this year onto the new system, and learn from that approach for the other  million who will be transferred later.“It is there to help a person get through a dficult stage in le – it is not meant to be a mode of long term subsistence for those who can work.“I believe that for the vast majority of people it is ultimately work, not benefits, which provides the route to a better le.”The pilot will begin in July this year and over the next  months Rudd will continue to review the system.But it wasnt enough to cover their bills and buy food so they ended up flogging their stuff and taking out payday loans - and now owe over £,.It made us feel so humiliated, worthless, said Kirsty. “Having worked so hard for everything only then to lose it because of Universal Credit, it’s very damaging to a human being.They never know how much theyll get on Unviersal Credit due to Dales job as a HGV driver due to his unpredictible hours and have been hit by the taper rate.If Dale is lucky enough to secure more shts than usual in a month then the familys Universal Credit payment is taxed at a rate of  pence per pound.“It’s making people vulnerable, knowing they have to wait a certain number of weeks to get a payment, she said.

It gives them hope that one day they may finally find out what happened to their daughter.”He added: “Having more than £ million sitting in fund sounds like a lot of money but Kate and Gerry worry that one day it could be swallowed up in legal fees and a potential libel payout to former Portuguese police officer Mr Amaral.”The seven-and-a-half year Maddie inquiry codenamed Op Grange has been given more funding to keep it going until the end of March. So far it has cost the public £. million.A Home office spokesperson previously said: “We have confirmed that Special Grant funding of £, will be provided to the politan Police Service for the six-month period to  March . This is an ongoing police investigation.”A Yard spokesperson added: “The inquiry has not reached a conclusion and we’re continuing with focus and determination.”Ex police chiefs and some members of public have previously slammed the Maddie inquiry as a waste of public money and officers’ time despite it being drastically scaled down over the past few years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000366712559.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"germany defence minister eu building united army","story":"Germany and France are now the driving forces in European defence and they would stand together in the face of any land assault, said Ursula von der Leyen.The politician also hit back at those who criticise the European Unions PESCO defence scheme - where national military leaders pledge to co-operate with each other.PESCO - which stands for Permanent Structured Cooperation - involves  armies working alongside each other.She insisted the countries had signed up not because we’re following requirements from Brussels but voluntarily because the benefits are obvious and because it’s in Europe’s security interests. She wrote in German newspaper Handelsblat : We are making good progress.

Instead, he took up an apprenticeship in the finance team at water treatment firm ESC Global Ltd, based in Doncaster, Yorkshire, studying AAT Accountancy Qualications. He gets time off to study and his course fees are fully funded by his employer.“Taking the AAT route meant that I could gain valuable experience from professional people in accountancy,” said Ryehan, now .“The apprenticeship offered me a debt-free way to get qualied, as well as earning a salary whilst learning.“At the end of my studies I will have a highly respected qualication behind me, teaching me all the qualities needed to be a successful accountant.”While Ryehan, who lives in Scunthorpe, was at sixth form he was on the lookout for an apprenticeship position, but found that not everyone was so keen.“My college weren’t able to offer me much support when it came to me searching and applying for an apprenticeship.“I felt that, in some quarters, there was a belief that to succeed, you need to go to university.”Tyler Bowers, , travels into London each day from his Essex home to Moore Stephens’ office near Barbican , where he works as a trainee accountant in their outsourcing department.“I always liked the idea of learning and earning,” says Tyler, who is studying AAT’s Advanced and Professional Diplomas in Accounting as part of his apprenticeship programme.“When I was  years old, I attended a careers fair, and an advisor there suggested accountancy. I knew I wanted to avoid the possibility of getting into debt by going into University, and realised I could instead train while being employed by a finance firm.”“I enjoy the studying and the accessibility of my tutors, who are available whenever I need them,” Tyler adds.“As an apprentice, I like the opportunity to work in dferent departments, and I feel like a valuable asset as I can apply my studies directly into my work.”Sixty two per cent of parents said their kids had come to them for advice on what they should do when they leave school.Fty six per cent of parents recommended that their kids continue on to university, and one in seven thought they would benefit from taking part in an apprenticeship.And one in eight parents thought their child would be served best by entering directly into the world of work.Seven per cent of parents had a firm view on what they thought their child should do next after leaving school, while six per cent took a backseat and let their kids make up their own minds.And  per cent thought university might cost more than it was worth to their child, and one in four didn’t think a university degree would ultimately help them to get into the career they wanted to.Seventy two per cent of parents believe apprenticeship schemes and further training courses have become a more viable choice for school leavers in recent years, according to the survey conducted by OnePoll.One in  parents wish they had given their child better guidance with regards to their future, though seven in  are happy with their level of involvement in the decision.Forty per cent said their main priority when advising their child on their future was that they did something which made them happy, and  per cent said it was that their child followed their passion.Rob Alder added: “Many young people are about to submit their UCAS forms to apply for university and that route will get a lot of attention.“Even with rising university fees adding a pressure on household finances, there is still only a minority of parents who are suggesting university alternatives to their children.“It’s essential that each young person is given the right advice for their inidual strengths, to give them the best chance of having a successful career, eventhat means advising them that university might not be the best option for them.“There are other options to explore, including apprenticeships and traineeships, advertised by sources such as the National Apprenticeship Service and Get My First Job.”David Allison, CEO and Founder of GetMyFirstJob said: “In recent years we’ve seen more and more young people and parents question the value they get from a traditional degree.“The fees and associated debt quickly rack up with a full time degree, and owing £, before you get your first job should really encourage all young people to look at the options open to them.“The good news is that there are now more alternatives than ever before to the ‘traditional’ university route with Accountancy and Professional Services leading the way.“We managed over , applications for accountancy and finance related apprenticeship roles last year, many of them with very attractive starting salaries.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words.

Ann Marie Grocott of Silverdale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, had reported her -year-old son, Jordan Taylor, missing on Easter Monday last year when he failed tohome from a weekend with friends. Ms Grocott and other relatives searched an old railway tunnel after receiving no news in three days. They found the teenagers body lying in a tunnel - covered in mud - with his shoes and mobile phones discarded nearby.   Jordans death remained a mystery in between the moment he left a house party on the night of April  - Easter Sunday - and the discovery of his body on April , an inquest heard. Ms Grocott revealed that Jordan had suffered from anxiety and depression since leaving school and had barely left the house for  months, reported StokeonTrent Live . Since being prescribed medication, the youngsters situation had improved and had started to socialise with friends. Its reported that Jordan left his home in Sneyd Terrace, Silverdale, on March , and intending to stay a friends over the weekend. According to Ms Grocott, she received messages from Jordan every day but heard nothing after Sunday lunchtime. She reported him missing on Easter Monday and police sent out helicopters to search for Jordan.   On Thursday, April , Ms Grocott and close family members went to look on land off Pepper Street, where the old railway tunnel is situated. We went on the tracks and walked towards the tunnel, she said.Me and my sister were looking up the sides of the tunnel. I saw his shoe first, up the side of the bridge. Then I heard my name being shouted. I turned and Jordan was there. Staffordshire Police launched an investigation into the death of Jordan as they interviewed people who had been with Jordan over the weekend. However, there was no evidence of third-party involvement in his death. It is believed the teen was last seen alive on Easter Monday when a resident of Coppice Avenue saw a youth thought to be Jordan reclined on top of the tunnel. Pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar concluded Jordan died from hypothermia and there were no evidence showing Jordan had been assaulted upon the post-mortem examination results. A high level of beta hydroxybutyrate was found in Jordans body, which indicated he had a previously undiagnosed problem with his insulin problems. Dr Kolar explained hypothermia can lead to severe confusion and sufferers can undress themselves believing they are feeling hot - which could explain why Jordan was not wearing his shoes. The test also revealed the teen had amphetamine and ecstasy in his system and he had also taken cocaine.   The level of drug was not toxic, but would have been important in whats taken place, Dr Kolar said. Iniduals that have taken drugs are more vulnerable to developing hypothermia - they are more likely to put themselves in situations that are not advisable, and drugs have an effect on the way the body regulates its own temperature. The cause of death was recorded as hypothermia, possibly diabetes-related, with a background of MDMAand amphetamine use. North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith recorded a conclusion of misadventure in Jordans death. He said: “Jordan was a vulnerable, naiumlve young lad in a situation where he did things because others were doing it. I think that’s the reason he took the drugs. “He left the house where he had been on Sunday night. No-one saw him leave. In his drug-affected state he left behind his bag. “He was seen in the area near his home on Monday. Why, oh why, did he not go home  The only explanation is the effect of the drugs and then the hypothermia, which has created this very confused state of mind. He has remained there until his body has given up at some stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"5 universal credit changes announced","story":"News Universal Credit changes announced TODAY - and  injustices that still havent been fixedTory DWP chief Amber Rudd admitted parts of the system are not \"compassionate\" as she unveiled a major shake-up.

Tory Amber Rudd admitted parts of the system are not compassionate as she announced changes to the two-child limit, payments to landlords and the movement of millions of claimants. The Work and Pensions Secretary also promised action in the future on inequalities that its claimed hand all the money - and power - to domestic abusers. But with million people set to be on Universal Credit with no transition payments by Christmas, unions, charities and Labour blasted her for not going far enough. So what has actually been announced today, how will it hit you, and where does it fall short  Heres a guide to five big things that have been announced - and five injustices still in the system.  things that ARE being fixed . A poundm extension of the two child limit is being scrapped  A wicked cut hitting , families a year will be cancelled in a U-turn - three weeks before it was due to take force. Tory welfare chief Amber Rudd announced she is axing an extension of the two-child limit that was set to kick in on February . The policy stops parents claiming Tax Credits or Universal Credit for more than two children - a cut of up to pound, per child. It applies to children born after the cut took effect in April  - but from February was due to apply retrospectively, hitting children born before the cut was dreamed up. That extension has been scrapped, putting poundmillion back in claimants pockets over three years. BUT HERES THE CATCH: Amber Rudd faced fury for keeping the two-child limit overall - claiming it is fair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies - which has warned the policy would hurl , children into poverty - said the long-term impact will be the same because eventually all children will be born after . By the mid-s, the IFS believes it will cut , families benefits. UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The two-child limit is morally wrong and should be scrapped for everyone.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation, said: “These families will still be just as vulnerable to falling into poverty as those who are now being exempted. This policy causes real hardship for thousands of people, and we would urge the Secretary of State to remove the cap altogether. Labour shadow work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “This partial U-turn does not go far enough. She added: The Government must stop the [UC] roll out immediately before more people are pushed into financial hardship.  Changes will be brought in later this year to ensure the UC payment goes directly to a familys main carer more often. Amber Rudd said she had listened to arguments that the one payment per household system punishes women. By paying men in a household, UC can allow domestic abusers to have a financial grip over their partner. Women can never be truly free until they have economic independence, the top Tory said. I am looking at what more we can do to enable the main carer to receive the UC payment. An [I] will begin to make those changes later this year. Womens Aid said it was a step in the right direction to empowering more women to safely escape domestic abuse. BUT HERES THE CATCH: This solution stops short of the automatic split payments that many womens refuge payments have demanded. And Ms Rudd has not actually said what the changes will be, or exactly when theyll be brought in. . More people will have rent paid directly to their landlord  More UC claimants will have their rent paid directly to their landlord out of their benefits through a new online system. It comes after a torrent of complaints that people received too little benefits to pay their rent, and faced eviction. Ms Rudd said: One third of UC claimants in social rented housing have their rent paid direct to the landlord. But in the private sector that numbers only %. People in the private rented sector already face a far higher risk of losing their tenancy. And I know from talking to claimants and landlords that the current system isnt working for some of them. So we need to make it easier for tenants in the private sector to find and keep a good home by giving landlords greater certainty that their rent will be paid. Therefore Ive asked the department to build an online system for private landlords so they can request where necessary for their tenants rent to be paid directly to them. Chris Town, Vice Chair of the Residential Landlords Association hailed the decision. BUT HERES THE CATCH: The online system will only be optional for landlords, we dont know exactly when or how itll launch or what itll be like, and online benefit portals have a history of foul-up and failure. . Youll be able to get paid more than once a month  At the moment, most UC claimants are paid monthly which is meant to mirror the world of work. But after years of complaints, Ms Rudd finally admitted today: For others this approach does not work. Managing their money month to month can be challenging, even impossible. That could cause dficulties for people who are already vulnerable and Im determined to do more to help those claimants. So Jobcentres are now being asked how we can improve the provision of more frequent payments for new claimants, she said. Pilots will start shortly and then rolled out further once we have evidence of what works. BUT HERES THE CATCH: There is, again, no detail of how this help will work. She also referred to new claimants, which raises the question of what happens to people already on UC. . You might not be forced to pay for childcare up-front  UC claimants with childcare costs get % of them funded. But they have to pay up-front - leaving many turning to food banks. Today Ms Rudd admitted: I recognise this can cause financial dficulty, with some claimants struggling to pay up front or report their costs on time. So she has asked Jobcentres to make two changes. First,the first months childcare costs prevent a claimant from starting work, that claimant should be supported through jobcentres Flexible Support Fund. Second, Jobcentres should be flexible when parents are unable to report their childcare costs immediately. BUT HERES THE CATCH: Asking Jobcentres to show flexibility and discretion is a policy thats been fraught with problems in the past. If someones treated more unfairly in Watford than Leicester, could they complain the DWP is being unfair   things that ARENT being fixed . The -week wait for payment ISNT being cut  Amber Rudd rowed back sharply on claims she could cut the five-week wait people face for their first UC payment. She had hoped to cut it back - but today claimed Im satisfied with what weve got. Citing advance loans and run-on payments she said: I think we have addressed some of the key elements. But Im going to keep an eye on it because I recognise the most important thing in Universal Credit is that people have confidence in the system but also they get the money early enough. She added: At the moment Im satisfied with what weve got but Im going to keep it under review to see that we are addressing peoples needs for getting their money as early as possible. . The benefit freeze WONT end early  Ms Rudd said shed like to end the four-year benefit freeze - which has cut almost poundbn a year from families pockets - in spring . But thats just when it was due to end anyway. And she admitted: I havent had any further conversations with the Chancellor so Id better not say anything too definitive at this stage. Campbell Robb, Chief Executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: The benefits freeze continues to be the single biggest policy sweeping families into poverty.If the Government is serious about being on the side of low-income families they will take immediate action to end this freeze one year early. Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: Instead of putting the most vulnerable in society through another  months of misery, Rudd should end the benefits freeze immediately. . Shes insisting UC wont actually be delayed  Amber Rudd confirmed she is delaying a vote by MPs on moving million existing benefit claimants to Universal Credit. MPs will approve only , trial cases for managed migration from this summer, with a full vote to be held at a later date. The Tory welfare chief said: Im not going to be rushed into the mass migration of existing claimants onto Universal Credit. My priority is to ensure the transition is done well. But Ms Rudd has insisted there will be no overall delay.Evenits pushed back, everyone will be moved over by .Secondly, youll STILL move overyou have a change of circumstances - see below... . The number of people on UC will double this year  Therell be million people on UC by Christmas - more than doubling the number on the benefit this year. Of those, hundreds of thousands will be existing benefit claimants who move over because they have a change of circumstances. Unlike the group thats being held back, they wont get any transition payments. Challenged by the Mirror, Ms Rudd was unable to say this decision was compassionate. Instead she said: The overall product that is Universal Credit is absolutely compassionate. . Workers are still being left out of pocket While Ms Rudd was giving her speech, four working single mums won a High Court challenge over Universal Credit. The women argued that a fundamental problem with the scheme means their monthly payments y enormously and they end up out of pocket. Two judges in London announced on Friday that the women - who say they are struggling financially because of the way the system operates - had succeeded in a judicial review action against the Work and Pensions Secretary. The ruling is a huge embarrassment for the government. The women challenged the method used by the Department for Work and Pensionswhen calculating the amount payable when their income changes month to month. Margaret Greenwood, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “It’s a disgrace that four single mothers have had to take the Government to court because of the impact that Universal Credit has had on their lives.“The Tories must stop the roll out of Universal Credit to ensure no more people are plunged into poverty and deprivation.” Asked about the case Ms Rudd said: Youll have to bear with me, Im not going to reply in full to that yet. Im going to have to consider it in the department and then well be coming forward with what our response is going to be.

People who have been targeted by thieves previously pay an average of . per cent more for contents insurance, so it pays to ensure your home is as protected as possible.If you take precautions - such as fitting new door and window locks, installing bar windows where necessary and using security cameras – you can reduce both your contents insurance and your anxiety about getting burgled.Looking for the best deal possible at every renewal will also help keep premiums low.

Photos published by BristolLive show trolleys filled with rubbish, including rolled carpets, piles of bricks and industrial waste.   Local resident Helen Ashley, who reported about  incidents last year, said: Not only does fly-tipping make BS look unwelcoming and dirty, it also creates issues with hygiene and accessibility. I have seen rats and mice in the street around open bin bags which have been dumped, and people are struggling to walk - much less push a pram or use a wheelchair - down the streets.

Millions are suffering symptoms such as a fever, chills and body aches and experts fear that this could put pressure on the already stretched NHS. The virus is now circulating widely across the UK and within the space of a week, cases have risen by  per cent in England and by  per cent in Wales. Meanwhile reports of the flu have risen by  per cent and by  per cent in Northern Ireland. PHE publishes a weekly report showing the number of flu symptoms that have been recorded in GP consultations.   Based on how often flu symptoms are reported per , patients each country sets its own criteria on what it considers to be an epidemic. While none of the home nations have reached the point of being an epidemic yet, England and Wales are in the “low” threshold. This is the second step on a five-point scale towards “very high” which are epidemic levels. Meanwhile in Scotland and Northern Ireland, levels are at the first threshold, which is baseline. The North East, West Midlands, North West England and Yorkshire and Humber have a “medium intensity” of cases, making it the worst affected. London, the South East, East Midlands, South West and East of England are less affected and are at “low intensity”. Regional figures are not available for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Rates are at their worse since monitoring began in September and over three months  people have died of the illness. PHE figures released today revealed that the UK had one average  flu diagnoses per , people last week. And it showed that the HN strainwas the most widespread.  In the previous week there was a  per cent rise, which was the final week of . PHE added that the increase of cases means that the flu is having a “moderate impact” on hospitals and intensive care units. One third of this season’s flu cases that needed treatment intensive care happened last week - which is  of a  total. PHE is advising anyone who is eligible to get the flu jabthey have not already. For the first time this winter, all primary school children are now eligible for a free nasal spray flu vaccine as well as children aged two and three years old on August , . The vaccine is also being offered to staff working in residential care and nursing homes this winter who have regular client contact.   In addition carers, volunteers providing care or providing first aid in organised public events, as well as community first responders, are entitled to the vaccine. And adults who are morbidly obese – with a body mass index of  or more – can also have a jab for free. Those not eligible for a free NHS vaccine – such as healthy adults – can pay for one at their local pharmacy for between pound and pound. To improve effectiveness dferent flu vaccines recommended for dferent age groups are being introduced this year. There are four dferent types in total – one for children , two for adults under  years old, and one for those aged  and above.If you think you have flu, check out the symptom checker at www.nhs.uk conditions flu.

First-time mum Mel Bremner, , bent down to pick up the shampoo in the shower when she saw her guts spill out. She hobbled to the sofa with the help of partner Aidan Johnson, , who covered her with a towel while the paramedics rushed to their home. Mel - who admits she has a high pain threshold - posed for a photo while they waited, before being airlted to hospital.She shared the photo with parenting site ChannelMum in a bid to dispel the myth that c-sections are easy and encourage mums to heed advice to take it easy after the major surgery.  Brave Mel, a hotel waitress from Macduff, Aberdeenshire, said: When I look at that photo I remember sitting there and my stomach and insides were literally in my hands. It was all gurgling around and moving. It was awful. I was sitting there thinking oh my god Im holding my intestines. It was quite creepy. Everyone was asking me what have you been doing  but I wasnt doing anything I shouldnt have - I was just having a shower. People think that c-section is the easy way out. Its really not. Its major surgery, but they dont tell you that at the time. They just tell you take it easy and away you go home.   I think after giving birth you are sort of expected to get up and get on with it. People are always telling you to take it easy but you just say Im fine. Mel had an emergency c-section on December , , after she was overdue, and she wasnt dilating despite medical intervention. The procedure at Dr Grays Hospital in Elgin seemed to go smoothly, and she was soon home with daughter Nadie, and partner Aidan, an off-shore engineering consultant. She said her surgery wound dressing was inspected before she left hospital, and she was deemed well enough to leave. Her partner noticed two white blobs in the middle of the wound four days after the birth - now thought to be fat - but they didnt suspect anything was wrong.   A day later she was in the shower when she bent down and the wound burst. I had only been in for a couple of minutes and I bent down to get the shampoo, she said. I dont rememberI felt it happen or saw it happen first, but my intestines were slipping out of my stomach. I put my hands underneath to catch it. I realisedI shouted out it would put pressure on my stomach, and thatI shout it will all fall out, so I was just trying to call out calmly to Aidan. He calmly led her from the shower to the sofa in the living room, propped up her feet and fetched a towel to cover her while calling for an ambulance. She said the pair contemplated covering her with cling film, but waited for paramedics who then called the air ambulance to take her to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.   I dont think the woman on the end of the phone believed him really, she said. I was sat there holding my insides the whole time. I darent move my hands. She had surgery and after a couple of days in hospital was home again. The couple said the c-section consultant later speculated he had cut the end of the thread too short while stitching her up, or not tied the knot tight enough. Mel later had daughters Allie, now four, and Robyn, now three, by c-section, despite the traumatic experience with Nadie, now seven. She added: If Aidan had panicked I think I would have too, but he was brilliant and calm. A spokesperson for Dr Grays Hospital declined to comment.

John Finnis, a professor of law and legal philosophy for  years, says he has “absolutely” no hatred towards gay people. But the petition claims the professor has “a long record of extremely discriminatory views”. Some also argued his involvement in the university was discriminatory towards those who feel uncomfortable attending his classes. The protest picks up on one of the professor’s papers, published  and again in , in which he states homosexuality is “never a valid, humanly acceptable choice and form of le.”   Prof Finnis, who is emeritus professor of law and legal philosophy at University College, allegedly wrote that homosexuality is “destructive of human character and relationships. “It treats human sexual capacities in a way which is deeply hostile to the self understanding of those members who are willing to commit themselves to real marriage.” But the -year-old Roman Catholic told BBC Radio ’s Today programme that the paper is about “freewheeling heterosexual sex le” such as adultery and premarital sex, which he strongly disagrees with. In the  reprint of the paper he included a summary stating those who “accommodate” wild behaviour of this kind but support restrictions on homosexuality are “morally inconsistent.” “The summary ends by saying that those people who wink at heterosexual lestyles of a free-wheeling kind and on the other hand support restrictions on homosexuals are morally inconsistent, they are discriminatory, they are unfair, and it’s a deplorable view” said Prof Finnis.   Askedhe had hatred towards gay people, the professor said: Absolutely not. I have friends and my family have friends. We benefit from them. “They are good people and hatred is not on the scene. He also said that those who feel uncomfortable in his classes do not have to attend, because they are not compulsory. “No-one has to do that course or go to the seminars that I do with colleagues in the law faculty.” The professor said the allegations were just “a mixture of muddle and misrepresentation”, adding that he is no longer employed by the University and only teaches certain courses when invited to.

Dietitians are urging people across the UK to eat more fibre, which is neglected in around  percent of the populations diet. Eating wholegrain foods which contain dietary fibre could reduce the risk of contracting a range of deadly diseases including diabetes and cancer, a study has concluded. The risk of contracting a wide range of communicable diseases, including heart disease, could fall by as much as a third with a diet containing grains, pulses and wholegrain bread. Experts from the University of Otago in New Zealand and the University of Dundee say people should be eating around g of fibre a day. A team looked at clinical trials and studies conducted over the last four decades involving more than a million people with the findings published in the Lancet.   For every , participants in the  studies and trials, the impact of consuming higher fibre intakes translates into  fewer deaths and six fewer cases of coronary heart disease when compared to those consuming lower fibre diets. Dr Andrew Reynolds, lead author of the study, says the results showed there was clear evidence people should increase their intake of fibre. He said: Our research indicates we should have at least  to  grams of fibre from foods daily, although most of us currently consume less than  grams of fibre daily.  The study was commissioned by the World Health Organisation which is looking at the development of new recommendations for optimal daily fibre intake. Co-author professor Jim Mann said: This study is essential as there is increased public confusion over what to base our meal choices on, and the impact our dietary choices have on our risk of certain diseases.   Researchers also found people who increased the amount of fibre in their diet had lower body weight, and total cholesterol. Prof Mann said: We also found an overwhelmingly positive effect, with high fibre diets being protective against heart disease, diabetes, cancers and measures of mortality.

Heart-stopping CCTV footage from the bus captured Irena Ivics heroic actions as the small girl, who was just -months-old, wandered alone along a pavement just days before Christmas. Ms Ivic had to do a double take when she saw the child - who was dressed only in a onesie and a nappy in the freezing cold - without an adult in sight, but quickly parked the bus and gave chase. The mum and former teacher ran across a busy street, stopped traffic and snatched the crying youngster out of harms way before carrying her back to the bus.   Ms Ivic has been hailed after video of the shocking incident was released by her bosses in the US city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She said shes grateful she was in the right place at the right time. The incident happened just before am on December  last year. Video from the Milwaukee County Transit Systembus shows the girl running back and forth on the flyover as Ms Ivic stops her bus on the opposite side of the road.  She gets out and holds up her hand, signalling an oncoming driver to stop as she runs across the road. She then grabs the girl, who is standing at an intersection near some homes, and carries her back to the bus. Ms Ivic says: Oh my God, oh my God. Im shaking. A passenger tells her: I am, too.  Ms Ivic gets back into her seat at the front of the bus, and cradles the child as a passenger approaches from the back of the vehicle and hands over her jacket to help the child warm up. She strokes the child to keep her calm, and the girl falls asleep in her arms. Ms Ivic called in the rescue and waited for police and firefighters to arrive. Footage from the bus CCTV system shows the girl being carried away by a police officer as a search for her family was under way. The toddler was cold and scared but unharmed.  The baby’s father said his we has a mental illness and she took the baby to a church near the motorway. He told a local Fox TV station that he thinks she forgot about their daughter and the girl wandered off.He said he noticed his daughter was not home when he saw police in the area. The MCTS said of the incident: As Irena called for help, a passenger gave up her coat to help keep the baby warm. The child was cold to the touch after spending time outside in the freezing temperatures.  Irena comforted the terried youngster, who soon fell asleep in her loving arms. Spokesman Matt Sliker said: Authorities eventually reunited the baby with its father. The mother was not charged. At a commendation ceremony on Thursday, Ms Ivic told reporters: Im just grateful I was in the right place at the right time. She added: I absolutely love kids. I used to be a teacher and I have children of my own, so Im so happy I was able to help this sweet, innocent baby.

Kerri Rawsons world came crashing down around her after she discovered her father Dennis Rader was actually the BTKmurderer. A seemingly normal dad, he had spent more than  years prowling the streets of Kansas, US, slaughtering  people - including two children. And horrically, he had hidden mementos from his disgusting crimes at his familys home - including underwear stolen from his murder victims. Kerri, who is releasing a book about her shocking story this month, recalls one particularly stormy, thundery night in , when she was just six. I crawled into bed with Mom. I wouldn’t haveDad was home. Slept on his side of the bed, she writes, according to the New York Post.   She adds: Did that sometimes when he was gone. I only remember that night because our neighbour lady went missing. It would later emerge that the neighbour was among those murdered by Rader, who carried out the Wichita murders between  and . A churchgoer and stamp collector, the serial killer slaughtered his first four victims - two parents and their two little boys - before Kerri was born. He hanged one of the innocent youngsters from a drainage pipe. And in subsequent years, he would go on to secretly kill six more people. As well as keeping some of his victims underwear, Rader also hid a business card at his home, with details of his next kill scribbled on it.   But it was only in  that Kerri, who wouldnt go through her dads things, discovered his unimaginable secret - when he was arrested by police. Then aged , the young woman found an FBI agent standing at her door after her father finally slipped up and revealed himself to be BTK. Everything she had known and loved came crashing down, according to her book, A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming. Scouring the web for information on the previously-unsolved murders, she tumbled into an abyss of despair and terror, the Post reports. Soon, she found herself reflecting on items her dad had once carried or had in their home and wondering whether they were linked to the killings. She also listened to a  call that BTK made after he broke into a young womans home and strangled her with a belt after she ed from work.   A court heard how he masturbated after carrying out the brutal killing. Through the static, in seizing fear, I recognized my dad’s voice — younger, but him, Kerri writes about the emergency call, placed in . ” Rader, now , is serving  consecutive le terms at a Kansas prison. Sickeningly, he gave himself the BTK nickname, which became his infamous signature as he evaded police for more than three decades. He previously admitted having plans to kill an th victim, whom he said he planned to hang upside down in her home before he was caught. His downfall came when he sent a computer disk to a TV station in February  - with an analysis of metadata linking him to the item. Rader pleaded guilty to his crimes, which he recalled in detail in court.   He later worked with Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychology professor at DeSales University, to publish a book about his crimes - Confession of a Serial Killer: The Untold Story of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer - with the proceeds going to a trust fund for the victims families. After his arrest, several grieving relatives sued Rader, securing a settlement that agreed he could never profit from his crimes or coverage of them. Today, Kerri has still not reckoned fully with who her father actually is - viewing him as  per cent her dad and five per cent a stranger. But despite acknowledging he has devastated countless lives, she has experienced forgiveness towards him and they have had correspondence. She writes in her book that on on the days when I’m not wrestling with hard, terrible truths, I will tell you: I love my dad - the one I mainly knew.A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming is published by Nelson Books and will be released on January "},{"url":null,"title":"best pasta sauce world contains","story":"NewsBest pasta sauce in the world contains just three ingredients – and one might surprise youLegendary cookery writer Marcella Hazans celebrated recipe also does away with the need for choppingShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience EditorJoshua Barrie:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror lestyle video best-pasta-sauce-world-contains-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen it comes to quick weeknight dinners theres nothing easier than a bowl of pasta and some tasty tomato sauce. Whether you add extra ingredients to it to make it a bit fancier or have it as it is, its a go-to for people up and down the country. But the jars of ready made sauce many of us have at the back of the cupboard for emergencies can be packed full of sugar, and Dolmio maker Mars Food once insisted its sauces are only eaten once a week. Uncle Bens too. But according to Italian American food writer Marcella Hazan, a good pasta sauce is remarkably simple and economical, too. Much cheaper than buying jars.   Marcella, who died in , was born in Cesenatico, Italy, in  and went on to open a New York cookery school and write hugely respected cookbooks. In one of them, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Marcella advises using only three ingredients in tomato sauce: onion, butter, and tinned tomatoes. Thats it. How much butter, you ask  A generous knob. The  recipe is still revered by food writers and cooks alike. No chopping is required. And pasta and tomato sauce is always a hit round the family dining table. Marcellas precise instructions are to put half a peeled onion into a pot with butter and tinned tomatoes and to leave it all to simmer for  minutes. Food publication Delish dubbed the sauce the best in the world. Her husband Victor talked to Epicurious about her efficient methods: Marcella was a genius when it came to taste. She had an immediate understanding about how flavour affects a dish. Marcella Hazan favoured ease and efficiency   She asked herself, Why chop an onion  Why saute  Im going to put the onion, tomato, and butter together and forget about it. Is it really the best in the world  Its a bold claim and a subjective one. But Italians are famous for their simplicity in cooking. Its all about the produce – tomatoes being one of the most important. No other preparation is more successful in delivering the prodigious satisfactions of Italian cooking than a competently executed sauce with tomatoes, Marcella says in her book. Her sauce is very rich. Others favour dferent techniques. Jamie Oliver adds four cloves of garlic and garnishes with fresh basil. BBC Good Food recommends starting with a classic mirepoix base , and scores of top chefs use ious herbs and oils and other trickery to elevate their dishes. Anchovies are good. The sauce is perfect for home cooks with little time   Food writer Felicity Cloake suggests the more classic use of olive oil in tomato sauce. She also puts in a pinch of sugar and some red wine vinegar. The thing to do is experiment. Garlic or no garlic, parsley or thyme or basil or rosemary, as long as the tinned tomatoes are good and theres parmesan on the table, we imagine people will be well fed. One things for certain, though – Marcellas advice is an ideal time-saver and perfect for amateur cooks with busy families. Andyou do decide to put tomatoes on to cook, remember: - dont boil your sauce, simmer it - add a ladle-full of pasta water to the sauce - lots of salt in the pasta water - no need for oil! If pasta sticks, its overcooked - and always add the pasta to the sauce, not the other way around "},{"url":null,"title":"two heads extra legs kenny","story":"Two heads, extra legs and Kenny the ugly tiger - the worlds most unusual animalsThese are some of the worlds most unusual animals, who were born with extra limbs often due to genetic mutationShareCommentsByNick AshRhian Lubin:,  JAN NewsKenny the tiger is deformed because of inbreeding Two-headed sharkFisherman Christian Johnston discovered this two-headed blue shark off the coast of Australia a few years ago.

JonBenet Ramsey was just six when she was found bludgeoned and strangled o death in the basement of her family home on Boxing Day in . And now convicted paedophile, Gary Olivia, is reported to have confessed to killing the six-year-old. The -year-old is said to have admitted to killing JonBenet by accident in letters to a school friend. The young beauty queen was found by her father the day after the family reported her missing. They had received a two-page ransom note asking for , in exchange for the child’s safe . But, eight hours later, her dad discovered his daughter’s body under a white blanket with a cord twister round her neck in the basement of their family home. Her wrists were bound and she had been gagged with duct tape. She had also suffered a fractured skull. What happened on the days before her death and who were the initial suspects   Christmas Day had been an exciting time for the Ramsey family. Father Christmas had delivered a new bike to delighted JonBenet and she tried out her present that day - it would be the last time she rode it. Along with her dad, John, mum, Patsy, and brother, Burke, who was then nine, JonBenet went for dinner at at family friends. The six-year-old was tired after her day of fun and was carried upstairs, sleeping, by her father when the family ed home later that night. This would be the last time anyone in the family saw her alive. Just eight hours later her tiny body was discovred in the basement of the family home. As the only people known to be in the house at the time of her killing, JonBenet’s parents Patsy and John were soon under suspicion.John, a computer executive, and Patsy, a former Miss West Virginia, went on CNN to insist they had nothing to do with their daughter’s tragic murder. Within two weeks of the girl’s murder, police considered her parents were unlikely to have committed the brutal crime. They were cleared of any involvement in  with the help of DNA technology. The ransom note  The ransom note discovered with JonBenets body was handwritten on pages ripped from a notepad her mother had kept by the telephone. Theories circulated suggesting the ransom note was actually written by the little girl’s mum. The sum asked for was the exact amount JonBenets father had received in his work bonus that year. Experts also claimed there was a connection in handwriting style between Patsy and the note-writer. Cina Wong examined the note for three weeks in , comparing it to examples of Patsy Ramsey’s writing. Wong claimed there were over  similarities. Suspects JonBenet’s older brother Burke was nine at the time of her murder. Theories emerged that he could be the killer and that their parents covered up JonBenet’s death to protect their son. He was cleared by DNA evidence. Around the th anniversary of JonBenets death, her brother spoke out for the first time in  on US talk show Dr. Phil. He said: “I dont know what to say to that, because I know thats not what happened.  Theres been people who have said thats not even physically possible for a nine-year-old to do that,” he said. “Like you wont find any evidence because I didnt do it.” John Ramsey revealed later how he tried to hide the allegations splashed across the papers from his young son. The headlines from a tabloid screamed out that Burke had done it, he said in . She [Patsy] dropped her produce and rushed Burke out but the damage had been done.  In  a jury voted to charge JonBenets parents with child abuse that resulted in the death of their daughter. The charges were never pursued and DNA evidence later also cleared them both. Patsy Ramsey died from oian cancer in ,  years after her daughters murder, aged . Burke Ramsey said he chose to finally speak out about his experience because: I know people think I did it that my parents did it. I know that we were suspects. I want to honour her memory by doing this interview. I dont want anyone to forget. He told Dr Phil that “I kinda always just thought it was a paedophile who saw her at one of the pageants, snuck in, who knows ” The district attorny apologised to JonBenets parents in  and exonerated them of any wrongdoing in relation to their daughters death. What other theories are there   DNA evidence taken from under JonBenets nails at the scene cleared both her parents and her brother. It revealed the little girl had probably clawed at her attacker in the strugle. But the DNA did not come from anyone who had been at the scene, her family or anyone who had handled her body. It was from an unknown male. DNA, believed to be saliva, was also found in her underwear. The intruder theory  With all of JonBenet’s family cleared of her murder, another possible explanation was that an intruder forced entry into their house and carried out the killing without anyone hearing the horric crime take place. The CBS documentary examined a broken window, which could have been used to access the basement where JonBenet was found. JonBenet’s dad said he broke the window some time before the murder when he was locked out of the house. Boulder Police Department initially ruled out anyone gaining entry through this window. But on the other side of that broken window was a suitcase, where police found a footprint.Its thought that an intruder could have possibly stepped on the suitcase to get back out of the window, leaving the footprint behind. The footprint was from a pair of Hi Tec boots, which the familys lawyer insisted that is proof that an intruder got into the house. The lawsuit  Burke Ramsey filed a lawsuit against CBS for a docu-series made in ,  years after his sisters murder.He sued the US broadcaster after their programme suggested he killed his younger sister.CBS officials requested the  million case be thrown out but a judge refused.According to Burke, his reputation was ruined after the two-part show - The case of: JonBenet Ramsey - concluded he was JonBenet’s killer.While CBS argued that the programme included a clear disclaimer which said: “The opinions and conclusions of the investigators who appear on this program about how it may have occurred represent just some of a number of possible scenarios.”However, the judge, Michigan rd Circuit Court District Judge David Groner, said that wasn’t enough to throw out Ramseys case.He added: “This Court does not find that the disclaimer at the beginning and end of the program negate the docu-series potentially defamatory meaning.”According to local paper The Daily Camera, the case has since led to courts in the Ramsey family’s hometown of Boulder, Colorado, to request vast numbers of files from the police investigation.The police are fighting the subpoena on the basis that “disclosure of police investigative files will adversely affect the investigation.The case is still in the pre-trial stage. The confession  Convicted paedophile Gary Olivia has reportedly confessed to the killing in letters sent to a former school friend. He is said to have admitted to killing the child beauty queen by accident. The -year-old is serving a -year sentence for child abuse image charges. In one of the letters, Oliva allegedly wrote: I never loved anyone like I did JonBeneacutet and yet I let her slip and her head bashed in half and I watched her die. It was an accident. Please believe me. She was not like the other kids. In another letter, Oliva is alleged to have said: Yet by accident she died and it was my fault. The Boulder Police Department is investigating.

Nationally the figure is ..And in among the figures are the unlikely success stories of boozers brought back from the brink of extinction.The Tavern, in Whitfield, has proved that new premises are finding their feet in a challenging market.The pub opened its doors at the end of June last year.Manager Elysia Rice said the pub still plays an “important” part in bringing communities together.She said: “I’m not surprised to hear these figures. It can be a dficult market.“Competing with national chains and well-established pubs is a tough task.”Elysia, who has been in the licensed trade for more than six years, said it was harder for city centre pubs to compete.She added: “It would certainly be very challenging for a start-up pub to go into town.“Pubs can still play an important part in the community.“We’ve got a darts team in the pub and are in the process of starting a football team as well.“The older generation maybe lost a bit of that when the Whitfield Club closed its doors.“We now have a Tuesday Club which is mega busy – it’s

visited the VA.“I believe city centre landmarks could have a positive impact on the surrounding areas.”Dale added: “There is a small team here working to make a go of this pub.”David Glass, president of Dundee Licensed Trade Association, said pubs were still a “cornerstone” of local communities.He added: “There is definitely a feel-good factor in Dundee.“People have said there are too many hotels but these companies don’t come into a city on a whim.”David, who has owned Doc Ferry’s in Broughty Ferry since , said: “The pub is still a cornerstone of society, especially in local communities.“There is no denying businesses have maybe had their fingers burned in the past, not realising the scale of what they’ve got themselves into.“The days of someone coming in and owning a pub

Other people will recognise that.”It is understood Premier League side Wolves sent scouts to watch McKenna in action earlier this season.While the Dons were in Dubai this time last year, they rejected a £, bid from Hull City.Having become a first-team regular, signed an extended deal and captained Scotland, his value has rocketed in many multiples since then.But the Dons have not yet settled on an exact number.McInnes said: “There is no figure set.“We value Scott highly and recognise the market that we think he can go into.“I think he can go direct to the English Premier League.“Centre-halves in the Premier League, to perform there as I have no doubt Scott can do – they have a value.”McKenna has been a stalwart of the Dons defence this season, during a time when the squad were rocked by injuries to centre-backs.Mark Reynolds had been out since July having undergone knee surgery for a cruciate ligament injury sustained in a friendly against Cove Rangers.On-loan Watford centre-back Tommie Hoban had been out since late August having undergone shoulder surgery on an injury sustained in scoring in a - draw at Hibs.Centre-back Mikey Devlin had also been out since sustaining a foot ligament injury while training with the Scotland squad in mid November.All three defenders are back in training in Dubai.Winger Gary Mackay-Steven also ed to light training for the first time having been side-lined with concussion.The -year-old was knocked unconscious in the - Betfred Cup final loss to Celtic on December .McInnes said: “It is good to see some of the injured ones coming back, and we also have some of the younger ones out here as well.“Having some of the senior players coming back into things and integrating them onto the pitch is pleasing.“Not all will be available for the Stenhousemuir game but just to get McGinn, Logan, Hoban, Devlin and Mackay-Steven in and around it is really encouraging.“It gives me a huge lt for the second half of the season.”McInnes has  players in Dubai. No new signings made the eight-hour flight out to the United Arab Emirates.Only two were left behind due to injury, with Bruce Andersonand Frank Rossremaining at Pittodrie to continue their rehabilitation.Rising youth stars Ethan Ross and Miko Virtanen took their places on the flight out.McInnes said: “I wanted to bring Frank and Bruce out, but we could only bring  including the two keepers and we’ve already got five or six senior players not able to do anything.“With the potential game here on Sunday we needed to make sure we had enough bodies that were actually able to do work.“Frank is still at a very early stage with his rehab in terms of doing a bit of running and wouldn’t have been able to do any ball work.“Bruce has got a problem not only with his calf, but with his shoulder after Livingston.“Ethan Ross and Miko Virtanen got brought in at the expense of Frank and Bruce because we needed bodies for training and with the game in mind on Sunday.“While we hope there are going to be some boys fit before the game, there’s still a chance they might not be.“Ethan and Miko have been training with the first-team squad for a while now so it was good to get them out here.“We’ve brought younger ones in recent seasons and they’ve always responded well.“So it’s good to have them out here because that enthusiasm from the younger ones can add to the session.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c383f67987497.98695345-124x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day one","story":"With Aberdeen#s training camp in Dubai under way, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on ing faces, an exit and the excellent facilities in the Middle East.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean will be sending video updates daily from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":null,"title":"action over north east travellers site put on hold","story":"Enforcement action against an unauthorised Travellers site will be put on hold until two fresh planning applications have been determined.In , councillors voted overwhelmingly to grant retrospective permission for the creation of an official halting site at North Esk Park in St Cyrus.But the application was called in by Scottish Government when the Scottish Environment Protection Agency objected after revealing the site had flooded in , ,  and .Scottish ministers overturned the retrospective permission and the Travellers were given until July  to clear the site.However, Aberdeenshire Council then agreed to extend the deadline by six months and has since been involved in “continued dialogue” with the North Esk community.A new report, to be considered by councillors on Thursday, states the whole site is the subject of a court order after unauthorised works were carried out, including erecting two chalet buildings.However, it adds that two new planning applications were lodged for the site on December , which could be considered by a meeting of all councillors on April .The report added: “While the planning applications are being processed, the enforcement process in terms of addressing the previous planning and enforcement decisions is effectively put on hold until the conclusion of the application process.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/Balmedie-CCTV-1.jpg ","title":"helicopter and specialist dog unit brought in to help find man last seen at north east beach","story":"Police Scotland#s helicopter and specialist dog units have been brought in to help in the search for missing man Alastair Done who was last seen at a beach in the north-east.Alastair, from Cheshire, was last seen by a dog walker at Balmedie Beach last Saturday.The -year-old was tracked using CCTV leaving Crewe Train Station on Friday January , arriving in Aberdeen at .pm.He was filmed going into Aberdeen Market and was later captured on CCTV at Premier Stores in Balmedie buying food and drink at around pm on Saturday.Since then, the clothes he was last seen wearing have been found on the beach at Balmedie, around one mile north of the car park.Following an appeal yesterday, police now know he stayed at the White Horse Inn in Balmedie on Friday night, and was spotted walking along the dual carriageway in the direction of Balmedie on the same day.Today his devastated family made an emotional appeal for him to come home.Speaking from the family home in Cheshire, his father Nick Done said they “all love him” and are mystied why he would have chosen to travel to the north-east, as he had no links to this region.Alastair is around ftin, has a #buzz# haircut and wears glasses.

Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls astonishing marine pollution captured on camera","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowImmersed in the fast-moving cosmopolitan world of the London photographic scene, it would surely take something special to draw Elizabeth Presland to the chilly west coast of Scotland in winter.Elizabeth is picture desk editor for the Sunday Times.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr.

Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"council-credit-card-spending-secrets-to-be-revealed-in-february","story":"A FAILURE to publish details of credit card spending by top brass at Scottish Borders Council has been blamed on \"changes to staff roles and responsibilities\".The use of credit cards by the Newtown St Boswells-based local authority has stirred controversy in the past with local MP John Lamont obtaining the payment details through Freedom of Information.But after a flurry of disclosures for  and  coupled with a declaration that \"we are committed to regularly publishing details on our credit card spending\" there has been no more bills released for ,  or .A further FOI request recently by retired journalist Bill Chisholm for the backdated information has been met with a response that council chiefs plan to publish three years worth of facts and figures in February.And, they claim, because they have stipulated a specic publication date within  weeks of the FOI request being lodged they do not need to prove details in the response.Mr Chisholm has been a long-standing critic of the council over its lack of transparency.The saga of credit card expenditure at SBC stretches back over almost a decade.Mr Lamonts January  disclosure revealed there had been nearly , transactions over the previous three years with two departments ndash the chief executive and environment  infrastructure ndash emerging as the most prodigious users of plastic cards.Lists of all items and services bought by this method were released by Mr Lamont who claimed Borderers would be ldquostaggered at the level of spending.At that time the Borderreported a council statement which said:ldquoElected members play no part in sanctioning the use of the credit cardhellipThe list provided to Mr Lamont showed that, between April,  and November , the chief executiversquos department made credit card purchases worth pound,, compared to pound, between November,  and March, .A statement from Mr Lamontrsquos office noted: ldquoThe chief executiversquos credit card included several purchases from Amazon totalling hundreds of pounds.ldquoThere were also several purchases from iTunes as well as money spent at bars and restaurants.ldquoMeanwhile, the environment  infrastructure departmental spend was mainly on accommodation and travel, although it did include items such as a womanrsquos jacket and a manrsquos fleece.The subsequent transactions for  and  remain posted on the councils website.Examples included on the chief executives list of purchases include three payments totalling over pound to the Conciliation  Arbitration Service for mediation training accommodation for the  General Election count in June and a foreign exchange fee for a European Commission event .In the same year the Corporate Transformation Service at SBC used its card to pay shipping and insurance costs associated with the acquisition of Mungo Parks trunkand accommodation for seven at the Tomorrows People Awards .But unfortunately the information trail ends in December  with no further details published since then.The recent FOI request by Mr Chisholm to the council asked Unfortunately details of corporate credit card spending for ,  and  have never been published.

I can still play to a level. Not a level that Irsquom happy playing at. But itrsquos not just that. The pain is too much really and I donrsquot want to continue playing that way.ldquoDuring my training blockI spoke to my team and told them I canrsquot keep doing this.

But Irsquom also not certain Irsquom able to do that.Andy Murray during the press conference at the Australian Open After another pause while Murray sat with his head on the desk, he was asked whether this might be his last tournament.ldquoYes I think therersquos a chance of that for sure because Irsquom not sure Irsquom able to play through the pain for another four or five months, he said.\"View this post on InstagramBest way to feel better after a tough day is a big cuddle from your mum # Genuinely been very touched by all of the messages and support from everybody todayhellip It means a lot and has made me feel much more positive than when I woke this morning#Thank you so much. ##A post shared by Andy Murrayon Jan ,  at :am PSTldquoI have an option to have another operation, which is a little bit more severe than what Irsquove had before in having my hip resurfaced, which will allow me to have a better quality of le and be out of pain.ldquoThatrsquos something Irsquom seriously considering right now. Some athletes have had that and gone back to competing but therersquos obviously no guarantees with that and the reason for having an operation like that is not toto professional sport, itrsquos just for a better quality of le.The hip problem first emerged after his French Open semi-final loss to Stan Wawrinka in June , although Murray revealed as he limped through Wimbledon that he had been managing a condition for a number of years.He did not play again for nearly  months but had been relentlessly positive about his progress despite all evidence to the contrary. It was clear, though, as he started this season that something had changed.Andy Murray has been competing in the same era with three GOATS.ndashndash x Grand Slamsndashndash x Olympic gold medalsndashndash ATP Finalsndashndash  world No. ndashndash x Masters  titlesndashndash x Grand Slam finalsndashndash  total ATP titlesLegend # pic wxCxGqOWWmdash #AusOpenJanuary , Despite spending four months focusing on reconditioning ahead of  in an effort to start the year healthy, his movement was still restricted in a loss to Daniil Medvedev in Brisbane and then even more so in a dispiriting practice match against Novak Djokovic in Melbourne on Thursday.After that he headed off to see John OrsquoDonnell, the surgeon who performed the operation last year.ldquoI have a severely damaged right hip, said Murray. ldquoHaving the operation last year was to give it the best possible chance of being better.ldquoI have been playing with hip pain for a number of years, it wasnrsquot asit just started at the French Open after my match against Stan. It got to a level where I didnrsquot recover from that match, pushed it over the edge.ldquoHaving the operation would hopefully make it as good as possible. It didnrsquot help with the pain at all. There are certain things on the court I cannot really do properly now, but the pain is the driving factor.When you search for examples of ldquoemptied the bucket to be as good as they could be there should be a picture of Andy Murray sitting under that quote. Remarkable discipline for training, competition, sacrice, perfection, a little crazy # but a legend of a bloke. Bravo Andy #mdash Darren CahillJanuary , ldquoI can play with limitations, thatrsquos not an issue, itrsquos having the limitations and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis.ldquoI have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, becauseit did, it would be feeling brilliant right now.It is especially cruel that the problem emerged only a few months after Murray ascended to the top of the world rankings, cutting short a career that looked as though it had a lot more to give.But, evenhe does not win another match, he will go down in history as Britainrsquos finest tennis player and one of the countryrsquos greatest sports stars.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led tributes to Murray, describing him as a ldquolegend.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake. They could not have bigger shoes to fill."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs should come back from their constituencies and prepare for coalition","story":"But this New Year theres only one forecast that really matters: what will happen with Brexit  As in a war, Brexit will crowd everything off the political agenda in . Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

Wersquove decided to take a look at the Englishmanrsquos stats to see exactly what Rangers fans can expect from their new man.Defoe has always been seen as a natural goalscorer and with  goals in the English Premier League itrsquos not hard to see why. The ex-Spurs striker is the seventh-highest goalscorer in the competitionrsquos history and has spent almost the entirety of his career in Englandrsquos top flight.The graphic above charts Defoersquos goals per  minutes in league football since the   season and the results make for impressive reading. Even during the forwardrsquos worst season in front of goal, in  , he was still averaging . goals per  mins, or around a goal every four gamesyoursquod prefer. This is hardly prolic, of course, but it isnrsquot a poorin such a demanding league.:The Bulletin: Gerrard Further signings depend on moving players on | Hibernian keen on Lewis MorganPerhaps unsurprisingly, Defoersquos best goalscoring campaign came in the   season when he was playing for MLS side Toronto but of the  seasons hersquos spent in Englandrsquos top flight, Defoe has averaged more than a goal every two games on seven occasions. Even as recently as  , the forward was scoring . goals per  - a figure not to be snfed at.By analysing Defoersquos scoring rate over the last  seasons, we can see that there are peaks and troughs but - much to the encouragement of Rangers fans - there is no sustained period of clear decline. Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season. Gerrard has already asserted that Defoe is ldquoa very young -year-old and that the striker ldquohas a shape to die for in terms of how he looks after himself in response to questions about age creeping up on the forward. The stats suggest that, naturally for a player Defoersquos age, there has been a drop-off in some aspects of his game, but his goalscoring record throughout his career suggests that he wonrsquot struggle to find the net this season. Whether or not Defoe has what it takes to make it in Scotland remains to be seen but there are plenty of reasons for the Rangers support to be optimistic about his arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"photo-exhibition-captures-another-side-to-nick-cave","story":"In London to watch Scottish bands Orange Juice, Aztec Camera, Josef K and The Bluebells, Reekiersquos ersion kick-started a pilgrimage of sorts, as he followed Cave and The Birthday Party around the country.It would be a year or so before the bandrsquos chaotic howl of self-destructive trash-blues sooth-saying made it to Fe-born Reekiersquos adopted home town of Edinburgh when they played The Nite Club, one of the cityrsquos main small venues, situated within the confines of The Playhouse. Having bonded with Cave and guitarist Roland S Howard, this time Reekie made sure he had his camera.More than three decades on, some of the photographs he took that night and over the next few years in London and Berlin can be seen for the first time in Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn, Reekiersquos -page zine-like collection belatedly launched next weekend at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.ldquoLooking at the pictures again brought a lot back to me, says Reekie. ldquoI can remember the chaos and the aggression of the shows, but not any aggression in the people. I was really surprised to find everyone in The Birthday Party was so articulate, well-read and literate, and yet onstage it was almost like everything was stripped away to the most basic bones of absolute nihilism, and almost hatred for the audience. They got into a lot of fights that I witnessed, but after the show once things had calmed down, they relaxed with a bottle of bourbon, and you could chat with them about James Joyce or Dostoyevsky.The idea for Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn came after Reekie put some of his hitherto unseen archive on social media, and was approached to contribute to an exhibition in Los Angeles called Nick Cave Smoking. Reekie submitted four prints, one of which sold for . As Reekie puts it, ldquoIf someone in LArsquos willing to pay that for something Irsquove just got lying in the cupboard, maybe I should think about doing something.ldquoIrsquove always thought of doing an exhibition of my archive, but never got round to it. The book has already travelled as far afield as America, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Scandinavia and Canada. Itrsquos never going to make me a millionaire, but I feel quite validated by that.Reekiersquos images capture an unguarded sense of ease amongst Cave and co, with the band captured backstage making their own mark on the back of a torn-down Sad Cafeacute poster. Despite a strung-out demeanour that foresaw the self-destructive effects that heroin would have on the band, there is a sense of camaraderie at play, with Cave and Howard in particular looking like brothers in arms. It was a bonding perhaps caused by the absence of bassist Tracey Pew, who was serving a prison sentence. This necessitated Howardrsquos brother Harry stepping in.ldquoIt was chaotic, says Reekie. ldquoHarry had never played onstage before, and you could tell that Mick Harvey, as the only non-drug taker in the band, was trying to keep everything together.Later images reveal a haunted-looking Howard captured with his post Birthday Party band, These Immortal Souls. Elsewhere, a now solo Cave looks increasingly messianic. While Pew was dead by the end of  and Howard passed away in , one of Reekiersquos fondest moments is of offering Howard, his then partner Genevieve McGuckin and These Immortal Souls a bed in his flat following an Edinburgh gig.ldquoI went through to take Roland and Genevieve tea in the morning,rsquo says Reekie, ldquoand they were both sitting up wearing matching silk pyjamas, and were so polite in a way that no Birthday Party fan would believe.Sadly, no pictures of this myth-busting incident were taken.While he continued to take photographs, Reekie went on to become a music journalist of note, writing for Esquire, GQ and Loaded after that side of his career was kicked off in s Scottish music magazine Cut. The cover image of Reekiersquos book was taken in the Groucho Club, where Cave held court about his newly published novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel.ldquoThat was my first cover feature for Cut, Reekie remembers. ldquoI wanted to do the photographs for it as well, but they got Gavin Evans to do them.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn is the first in an occasional series of photobooks produced by Stereogram Recordings, which have released albums by the likes of The Eastern Swell, James King and The Lonewolves and The Cathode Ray. It is also the latest example of an ongoing unearthing of photographic archives from a pre-digital age that document often hidden histories of the post-punk era.This came to prominence in  with What Presence!, an exhibition and book of lost images by Glasgow-based former Sounds photographer Harry Papadopoulos. Produced by Street Level, What Presence! featured images of the Sound of Young Scotland era of bands, including Orange Juice, Altered Images and Fire Engines. Revealed! was a similarly styled document of the same era in Liverpool by Francesco Mellina, who photographed the likes of the late Pete Burnsrsquo band, Dead or Alive, and the post-punk scene based around Ericrsquos club.The Scene Inbetween and Untypical Girls are two volumes of DIY images taken of bands and fans in the s and s collated by Sam Knee, and which feature several images by Reekie. In a similar vein, former journalist turned AR man Ronnie Gurrrsquos Hanging Around Books has launched an ongoing series of booklets featuring never before seen seen images of the likes of Simple Minds and the Skids.As the age of the archive runs on, Reekie himself has thousands of photographic negatives in storage. These include shots of Edwyn Collins and Roddy Frame performing at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, and of Sonic Youthrsquos Kim Gordon alongside Lydia Lunch in their short-lived duo, Harry Crews.ldquoI reckon wersquove got enough to do another seven books, Reekie speculates. ldquoI could do one of early s club le in Edinburgh. Thatrsquos more about the people who were there rather than the bands, which might appeal to people of a certain vintage who were around then.It is this sense of empathy that makes Sometimes Severed Heads Must Burn such a crucial document of its era.ldquoItrsquos a step back in time, says Reekie, ldquoand because itrsquos all fly on the wall stuff, you can see therersquos a trust there, which the people in the pictures didnrsquot have with a lot of people at that time. Thatrsquos what I think makes them worthy.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn: The Birthday Party and Beyond - ndash Photographs by Innes Reekie is published by Stereogram, and launches at Street Level Photoworks, Glasgow on January .www.stereogramrecordings.bandcampwww.streetlevelphotoworks.orgends"},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-cleaning-up-the-plot-is-as-daft-as-a-loo-brush-but-sheridan-smith-sparkles","story":"***IT is a tough le being an actress.

Its first presenter was the veteran newsman Robin Day, who filled the chairman role for a decade.Bruce would probably have been cheered to hear that the first question he faced on the very first edition of the programme was bungled by the member of the audience picked to deliver it.Losing the thread, the woman askedit was the one about ldquobeer, before rooting in her handbag for guidance.Sir Robin filled in for her, explaining she should have asked the  what they would like to do on a night out.Next up to fill the presenter role was Peter Sissons, who was replaced in  by David Dimbleby.His time as chairman saw the rise of social media, and the programme embraced the new digital age with both a Facebook  and a Twitter page.Viewers have been encouraged to engage online during the live debates, and the Twitter feed has become the most popular in the UK during the hours Question Time is running.Meanwhile a spoof Twitter account @Dimblebot, that re-imagines the host as a ruthless, mechanised debate enforcer and tweets all caps commentary on the debates became an internet sensation.The show also thrived in the online landscape as the rise of memes offered fruitful commentary on the debates.The term ldquogammon is believed to have first been used as an insult by viewers during Question Time in .Speaking about his time at the helm of Question Time, he said it had been ldquoexhilarating following the twists and turns of British politics, adding: ldquoIt has been a privilege to work for a programme that brings voters face to face with those in power."},{"url":null,"title":"maid-of-the-loch-slides-back-into-the-water-after-cradle-snaps-during-lift","story":"But for the team behind the multi-million-pound bid to restore the Maid of the Loch, it took only a few seconds to turn sour.As a large crowd watched from the shore, the sound of a loud ldquosnap shortly after .pm was followed by the sight of the famous vessel sliding ignominiously down the Balloch Steam Slipway and back into the waters of Loch Lomond where she has spent virtually all her days.No-one was injured in the incident, but some of the volunteers on the slipway had to jump out of the way as the -foot vessel slid into the loch after the cradle supporting the ship fractured.The Loch Lomond Steamship Company, which owns the Maid, had invited the media and public to watch the ldquoslipping of the ship ndash the four-hour operation to haul her out of the water for an extensive hull survey, using the steamerrsquos original winch house, as part of a pound million refurbishment.With only a few hours of daylight left, a decision was made tothe Maid to its usual berth to allow crew members to examine what went wrong.John Beveridge, the chairman of the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, confirmed no-one had been hurt in the incident.But he said he did not expect there would be another attempt to haul the vessel back on to the slipway until the charity found out what had gone wrong.He added: ldquoItrsquos not exactly what we were intending. She was over on the cradle and she was being pulled out the water.ldquoWe were examining how the hull and the bow were on the cradle, and all of a sudden there was a loud noise. I had my back turned to it, so I didnrsquot exactly see what happened, but she ended up being pulled back into the water with the cradle.Mr Beveridge spoke of his relief that nobody was seriously injured.ldquoNobodyrsquos been hurt, which is great, and wersquove managed to secure the ship and shersquos back in her berth at the pier, he said.ldquoWe now need to find out whatrsquos gone wrong. We will be speaking to the people involved.ldquoWe need to recover the cradle, because itrsquos in the water, and until we can do that itrsquos very dficult to know exactly what went wrong. We have the pound million still to spend and getting her out of the water and examining the hull was just a small fraction of that money, so the majority of the money will still be spent on refurbishing the ship, doing up the engines [and] getting them working again with the steam.ldquoBut then wersquoll have to find out whatrsquos happened and make an assessment. At this moment in time we just donrsquot know.Asked when another attempt might be made to haul the vessel on to the slip, Mr Beveridge said: ldquoIt wonrsquot be in the next few days [trying again].ldquoWersquoll have to assess what went wrong and then see where we go from there. But at the moment, the ship is safe. Everyone  is safe.ldquoThatrsquos the main thing. Itrsquos entirely unexpected and frustrating when it was such an exciting occasion.Just minutes before the Maid began to move in towards dry land, Mr Beveridge had spoken of his satisfaction that a day which had been more than two decades in the making had finally arrived.He said: ldquoWersquove only got one employee, but the large number of volunteers wersquove got have been working for  years to get to this point and itrsquos great.ldquoThe turnout is fantastic and it just shows the level of support and interest there is for this old ship.

There has been much written about John Beatonrsquos performance at Ibrox, much of which I do not wish to go into here, just as I do not want to talk about the inexcusable reports about the alleged threats made towards the referee according to Police Scotland.However, the fallout from the game at Ibrox and the questions surrounding the lack of clarity over punishments in Scottish football, in general, has left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans that not even a few glasses of prosecco at New Year could wash away.Something has to give.:Chris Sutton:online pub pics are valid then John Beaton guilty of \"sheer stupidity\"The Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but that of the International Football Association Boardwith such  being installed across the world to make sure the laws and protocolsof the game are followed. However, the lack of transparency in the process is the fault of the SFA. While there are good intentions in the creation of a , the lack of scrutiny given to fans must change for the good of the game.Itrsquos only January but I have now lost count of the number of clubs that have come out and slammed the shocking standards of referees and the lsquostrangersquo outcomes from the compliance board. The SFA are pulling the wool over fans eyesthey think that this abysmal standard of governing can continue. Supporters are being let down on the pitch and then assured justice will be served by the much-derided compliance group behind an Oz-like veil that is even less rewarding than following the Yellow Brick Road.But rather than admitting there is a problem and trying to tackle it, the SFA are hoping that this all blows over.And it is their hubris that is preventing the standards of our game from improving.How often have we seen a manager fined for an offence in an interview or a player sent off for a kick only to have a similar incident a week later with no repercussions Itrsquos almost asthe Judicial Panel consists of three lsquoexpertsrsquo asking a Magic  ball and hoping for the best.Can you name any other industry were such major inconsistencies would go unaddressed  Rather than coming up with a fix, the SFA seem to just want to head to the Winchester for a nice cold pint and hope it all blows over.As said previously, the Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but admitting that its rollout in Scotland hasnrsquot been as smooth as desired would go a long way with supporters. In my opinion, there is an easy fix. Whatrsquos to stop the findings of the  and the evidence used in a review being published once the case is over  Is there a reason that referee and supervisor reports and marks awarded arenrsquot published after every game While these arenrsquot monumental changes they would certainly help in giving fans a deserved insight into our officials and provide clarity on certain issues.:Celtic hit out at SFA - and call on referee John Beaton to explain Alfredo Morelos decisions at IbroxI canrsquot imagine managers and chairman disagreeing with knowing exactly what chance they have of having a punishment upheld rescinded. So what is the problem in publishing all details of the case once it has concluded  It happens in the court of law, so why canrsquot it happen following a review within the chambers of Hampden Park Any fan can accept a decision going against their teamthey can see the evidence and see the rules of the game are applied consistently, but itrsquos the SFArsquos constant desire to lsquopick and choosersquo when to punish managers and players that irritates so many. Somewhere in the process, something is going wrong, and it needs to be investigated.By being open with reviews and how rules are applied, fans would finally have insight into the whole process. Yes, some would disagree with it but at least they could see the evidence and justication into why such a decision was made.Fans and even some clubs have suggested a review of the governing body for a number of years now, but their calls have been largely ignored. Enough clubs have been critical of decisions this year to surely warrant one or at least to ask why an investigation hasnrsquot been launched The inconsistency of fines and suspensions has to stop. The picking and choosing of rules to applymust end. Hiding behind statements cannot and will not bring about real change.The SFAs inconsistent approach and weak governance is systematically destroying the game and promoting claims of bias at the very top.What harm could possibly come from a little more transparency in the game  What is there to hide Something needs to change, andthis column gets at least one more person calling for a review of the game and the inept governing body then my job has been done.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Friday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said, “The EIS executive has agreed the timeline for the opening of a strike ballot over pay.“Our national council will now meet tomorrow to review this timeline and to consider granting authorisation for a statutory strike ballot on pay.”He added, “Our members have shown a great deal of patience over the past year, but this patience is now exhausted.“While we would still welcome any improved pay offer from employers, none has yet been forthcoming. Therefore our council will now decide whether to initiate a statutory strike ballot when it meets tomorrow.”Education secretary John Swinney has said an updated offer from the Government and Cosla was “a better deal than for any group of public sector workers in the UK”, but it was rejected by the teachers’ side of the negotiations.Teaching unions claim teachers’ pay has fallen  per cent in real terms in the past decade.A signicant increase is needed to show teachers they are valued and to help boost staff recruitment and retention.In an update to members, the EIS stated: “In an attempt to agree a settlement, the teachers’ side has proposed options which would improve the offer for all teachers, but it remains to be seenthese will be taken up.“We confirmed our willingness to meet again, as and when required.“Members have been extremely patient over a pay claim, which was due last April. Clearly that patience has its limit.“A special EIS council meeting has been arranged for this Saturday  January to decide on the next phase of the campaign, which may well be a move to a statutory ballot for industrial action,there is no further movement from Scottish Government and Cosla.”Mr Swinney said the pay offer “would see teachers receiving a minimum  per cent increase between January  and April ”.An earlier offer, which Mr Swinney said at the time was the “best available” and would give most teachers a rise of between  per cent and  per cent, was rejected by the teachers’ side of negotiations in September.The following month, more than , people marched in Glasgow in support of the teachers’ pay demand.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4853568.1547027972!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish budget three ways it could tackle poverty emma congreve","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Government#s draft Budget fails to live up to the SNP#s rhetoric on poverty and other parties should insist on changes before it is approved, writes Joseph Rowntree Foundation economist Emma Congreve.The Scottish Government’s draft Budget was a missed opportunity to take bold action to tackle poverty. It is crucial that all political parties use the upcoming budget negotiations to correct our country’s course.Just over a year from the passing of the Child PovertyAct and following the damning assessment of poverty in the UK from the United Nations’ Rapporteur, we had high hopes of the draft Budget.The Scottish Government has made tackling poverty a top priority, but platitudes and promises are not always making the transition into real, funded policy to transform people’s lives. Rhetoric does not help youyou are trying to decide whether you can afford to take a bus to work or pay for your child’s lunch.While ministers are right to restate their commitment to building more affordable homes, expanding childcare and helping parents into the workplace, we will not solve poverty merely with reannouncements of existing policy.It’s unacceptable so many children are living in poverty in Scotland – and the forthcoming Budget negotiations must right that wrong.Living in poverty can affect every aspect of family le. In the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report into poverty, we spoke to a single mother, Hazel, in Fe who is a care assistant with two teenage children.She told us: “If I compare things to an object it would be a hamster’s wheel. No matter how hard I work and how much I push myself, I still feel I am getting nowhere.”Too many families in poverty are faced with impossible choices, balancing paying the rent with the cost of childcare and being able to get to work, as essential costs rise. Every decision is finely balanced – do you buy fresh food or put the heating on  Everywhere they look, families can be restricted and restrained by poverty – but we know it can and must be solved.: One in four children living in poverty as childcare woes and disabilities biteOpposition parties will now play a key role in shaping the final Budget put before Holyrood and together, the parties must ensure the proposals avoid a step back in its fight against poverty.The Scottish Government now has an increasing range of choices about how it raises and spends money. But local government delivers critical support for low-income families, such as housing provision, local bus services and out-of-school care. To keep these families from being swept into poverty, they need adequate funding. Councils have been faced with continually squeezed budgets for day-to-day spending on existing services with little,any, recourse to tax-raising powers.Council tax reform will rightly be a key area of the budget negotiations. Currently, our evidence shows that falling behind with council tax, and harsh recovery of the money that is owed, is one of the key causes of destitution – where people regularly lack the ability to keep a roof over their head, feed themselves and keep dry and clean. Any reform to the system must ensure that there is a proper anchor for low-income households in dficulty so that they all receive the support they need.There are steps ministers can take now to ease the strain on household budgets. First of all, a quick and much-needed fix would be to increase the thresholds for the council tax reduction scheme in Scotland. This would ensure that working families in poverty are able to keep more of what they earn before they are asked to pay towards their council tax. Doing so could buy the Scottish Government and partners the time they need to develop and implement long-term reforms.: Gordon Brown warns of growing child poverty crisisSecondly, social security is another key tool that the Scottish Government can use to loosen the grip of poverty, and families should not have to wait until  for the income supplement to be paid. We would like serious consideration of delivery of an interim solution that is fully funded by Scottish Government but paid locally, using the expertise of councils in this area. As well as helping people who desperately need a step up now, it would provide genuine insight and learning before permanent rollout in .Finally, our labour market is not working for hundreds of thousands of Scots. There is much that Scotland’s business owners and managers can do to get the best out of their workforce by providing compassion, flexibility and security to allow people to build a le free from poverty. But fair work requires a supporting infrastructure that the Scottish Government must do more to provide.To make progress on labour market equality for women at work and boost their incomes requires further targeted investment in accessible, affordable and flexible childcare that can respond to the realities of the local jobs market, particularly in lower wage sectors. More investment in employability services is vital in breaking down physical and mental barriers, especially for those with long-term health conditions or disability. The Scottish Government also needs to look seriously at whether transport systems and concessions support those who need help the most. We all want to live in a society where nobody is worrying how they will get by from one day to the next. The true test of this Government will not be its words but its actions to support the poorest children in our society.Emma Congreve is senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855270.1547217609!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond case how likely is an inquiry into nicola sturgeon s actions","story":"Nicola Sturgeon could face some of her most dficult days and weeks as First Minister as pressure increases on the SNP leader to refer herself to an investigation over her handling of the Alex Salmond case. Mr Salmond won a signicant legal victory over the Scottish Government earlier this week when a judge at Scotland’s highest court ruled they had acted ‘unlawfully’ in how they handled allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The former First Minister- who has stringently denied the allegations levelled against him – has demanded the resignation of top civil servant Leslie Evans. Instead, it is his successor Nicola Sturgeon on whom most political pressure appears to be – with a bruising First Minister’s Questions session at Holyrood yesterday confirming the strength of feeling among opposition politicians. Labour leader Richard Leonard has written to the First Minister demanding that she refer herself to an independent  to investigate whether or not she has breached the ministerial code. : Sturgeon denies interfering in Salmond probeAt the centre of that call is Mr Leonard’s belief that Nicola Sturgeon acted improperly during meetings with Mr Salmond while an investigation is ongoing. We look at how likely that inquiry is to take place, and what damage it could do to the First Minister. Self-Referral While accepting the recommendation of Richard Leonard might seem like a turkey taking up an offer to vote for Christmas, Ms Sturgeon and her allies might see benefit in referring herself over her meetings. : Salmond refers Scottish Government to data watchdogIf they believe any inquiry from the  on the Scottish Ministerial Codewill clear the First Minister, they could yet see it as a viable strategy. In naked political terms, it will also crucially buy Nicola Sturgeon time, as any report could take weeks or even months to publish. There could, ironically, be a lesson to learn from her predecessor as Ms Sturgeon was deputy First Minister when Alex Salmond referred himself to the . A bitter row over the answers Mr Salmond gave over legal advice his government had received on the EU in the run up to the independence referendum led to a ministerial code inquiry. While Mr Salmond was chastised for the ‘muddled’ nature of his answers, the inquiry ultimately cleared him of breaching the ministerial code. Parliamentary arithmeticAs Nicola Sturgeon stressed repeatedly during yesterday’s testy session of FMQs, referral to the  is considered ‘a matter for parliament’. Richard Leonard himself has given an early indication of his plans should the First Minister refuse to refer herself to the . He told Good Morning Scotland: “If she self-refers, then that starts that process off. If she refuses to self-refer, then I think Parliament will try and take matters into its own hands.”Parliament, as Mr Leonard noted, has more non-SNP MSPs than SNP MSPs, andopposition politicians unite, then Holyrood could establish an investigatory committee. If all  SNP MSPs vote against an investigation, then Labour will have to persuade Conservative and Liberal Democrat support, as well as at least some of the Green group, to back a probe into Nicola Sturgeon’s conduct. If it comes down to a close vote, the position of Mark McDonald, who himself was censured by the parliament after allegations of sexual misconduct, could be crucial. The outcome There is clearly pressure from all sides on Nicola Sturgeon, with the news today that Alex Salmond had reported the Scottish Government to a data watchdog another unwelcome update. Ms Sturgeon could be tempted to seek exoneration by self referral, which again would potentially allow her breathing space as she continues to come in for criticism over her conduct as an inquiry takes up time. That path is littered with pitfalls, as an inquiry could yet find that the First Minister has breached the ministerial code. However, there might not yet be a parliamentary majority in place for Nicola Sturgeon to avoid an inquiry, with Labour in particularly clearly planning to step up their demands for a probe. Whether by self-referral or parliamentary process, a probe into the actions of Nicola Sturgeon now seems increasingly likely. The results remain anyone’s guess. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855335.1547220789!/image/image.jpg","title":"andy murray tennis star hailed as legend by nicola sturgeon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Sir Andy Murray has been hailed a #legend# by the Scottish First Minister after the tennis star announced he will retire this year.Nicola Sturgeon led praise from near and far after the dual Olympic champion fought back tears as he announced the coming Australian Open could be his final tournament.He admitted dficulties in playing with a recurring hip problem, but said he hopes to make Wimbledon in the summer, though he could not confirm that would be the case.: Andy Murray announces retirement from tennis in tearful speechAfter watching his announcement in an emotional press conference, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “Andy Murray is a legend – without doubt one of Scotland’s greatest ever sportsmen, as well as an outstanding role model and inspiration for young people everywhere.“A credit to sport and to the country.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27502  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“The Taoiseach#s problem is that he doesn#t like the democratic choice of the people of #those constituencies# and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Féin#s participation.” - Mary Lou McDonald TDSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has hit out at Taoiseach Leo Varadkar after he demanded that Sinn Féin MPs resign from their Westminster seats.The Taoiseach made the statement earlier today, claiming that the upcoming week is crucial for Tory leader Theresa May.“If Sinn Féin feel they got elected on the basis of abstentionist then they have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster,\" he said.In a response, the Sinn Féin President branded the Taoiseach’s comments as “absolutely ludicrous\" stating that “Sinn Féin have no intention of standing aside and abandoning our mandate.”Speaking to An Phoblacht, the Dublin Central TD said: “The Taoiseachs problem is that he doesnt like the democratic choice of the people of those constituencies and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Féins participation.”“Fine Gael, and Fianna Fáil for that matter, should put to the people their willingness to take seats in Westminster and to swearing an oath to a foreign power and let the people decide,” she said.In the  Westminster election, Nationalist voters turned their back on Westminster increasing Sinn Féins representation by more than double, while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil continue to abstain from political le in the north."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27503  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“The international community has a responsibility to support the Palestinian people and challenge the continuing human rights abuses of Israel. - Aileen MellonSolidarity demonstrations were held across Ireland last night in support of the people of Palestine. Demonstrations were held from Derry to Cork, organised by Sinn Féin, to mark International Day of Solidarity with Palestine. In Belfast, the demonstrations was held outside the headquarters of the BBC and called on the media to pay more attention to the plight of the Palestinian people. Speaking at the rally, Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan said: \"In the last four months dozens of people have been slaughtered at the border to with Gaza.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉIN"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence.

We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27513  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonFor its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.In the aftermath of her election as Uachtarán Shinn Féin, Mary Lou MacDonald, reaffirmed our party’s practical solidarity with the people of Palestine as a key international priority.I communicated this to the very broad cross section of Palestinian political opinion with which Sinn Féin maintains direct contact.As a result the Palestinian Legislative Council , which is Palestine’s elected parliament, issued an official invitation to Mary Lou and a leadership delegation to visit Palestine.In accepting this honour we asked the PLC to host a programme which would allow for engagement with all sections of Palestinian political and civic society, including all the main political forces.So in mid-December  a Party delegation, led by Mary Lou, including Pat Sheehan, Ciarán Quinn and myself, travelled to the occupied West Bank for five days.The PLC extended us every diplomatic courtesy and assistance during our trip including help to arrange a formal meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas the laying of a wreath at the tomb of Yasser Arafat by Mary Lou and, a tour of the Yasser Arafat museum.Our inclusive programme began with a meeting hosted in the Jordanian parliament in Amman by the Chair of its Palestine Committee, Yahya Al-Saud, before travelling directly to our first meeting in the West Bank, with Jonathon Conlan and Declan Johnston, the Irish government representatives in Palestine. Importantly, the government has just increased Ireland’s aid budget by two million euros – at a time when the US administration has slashed its contribution to the United NationsRelief and Works Agency.Over the next few days we met with all the political parties elected to the PLC women activists young people ex-prisoners political and human rights campaigners, including Boycott, Divestment and Sanction representatives local Councillors community groups and, media organisations.Throughout, we engaged extensively with all shades of political and civic opinion.We listened, learned, and made new friends.This trip came at a time of renewed political instability and conflict in the West Bank with increased Israeli military incursions and expanded settlement activity.An Israeli military lock down on Ramallah city was in place just days before we arrived.However, political disunity among the main Palestinian political forces has also intensied. Indeed it has probably deepened since ourto Ireland.Yet the importance of national political unity was spoken of by all the Palestinian representatives and citizens we encountered.The need for national reconciliation is the single most popular and urgent discussion within Palestinian society. That reality has found further expression in the launch since Christmas, of the new Palestinian National Democratic Assembly, which is an alliance including dferent progressive political and civic forces and personalities.We encouraged the pursuit of national unity among all Palestinians and reiterated Sinn Féin’s commitment to assist in whatever modest way we could to support that being achieved.A palpable anger exists among ordinary people throughout Palestine tempered with an absolute determination and resilience.Everyone we met, regardless of ideological and tactical dferences, is committed to popular resistance against the Israeli occupation.Nasser Al-Laham is the managing director of Maan news agency. He hosted us at his offices in Bethlehem six days before Christmas.Nasser is a former political prisoner who served  years. He’s one of the estimated one in five Palestinians who have been imprisoned since .The experience of prison and detention is prolic within Palestinian society.The Nakba of , when almost one million Palestinians were driven from their homes in historic Palestine to become permanent refugees, permeates every aspect of their historic and present day existence.Their collective, lived reality is one of colonialism, death, detention, discrimination and denial of rights.Nasser said evocatively“The Palestinian people are not violent people, they are angry people.”Just a few hours earlier we had walked around Jerusalem.While there we met Adnan Ghaith. He is the Governor of Jerusalem. He too is a former political prisoner, but is banned under Israeli military law in Jerusalem from visiting his office or carrying out official duties.Afterwards we went to Al-Esawiah, a neighbourhood on the edge of the city.A population of , live in this poor area, and,  political prisoners from there are being held in Israeli jails.From early that same day Israeli troops closed off its narrow, winding streets with ‘flying checkpoints’, carrying out searches and making arrests.These were familiar scenes to me.We were in the local community based Ambulance and Emergency Aid Association when Ahmed joined our company.Two years previously, when he was aged just , Israeli soldiers shot him in the right eye while he visited the shops.Afterwards we all walked outside as we did so three of Ahmed’s buddies, of around the same age, came over for a yarn. One of them had also been shot in the eye, as he ed from school.I shuddered when we were then told - a total of  residents from Al-Esawiah have been shot in the eyes.I felt inadequate. I had nothing useful to say.The previous day in Ramallah during a very emotional meeting with ex-prisoners from all political backgrounds two  year-old boys were introduced with their parents.Shadi and Ahmad had just been released from prison two weeks earlier. They were jailed at the age of , sentenced to three years each, and detained in inhumane conditions.I imagined how I’d feelthese were my sons.Meeting these four young teenagers was an unforgettable and moving experience.On the morning of our last day we visited the Tamimi family in their home at Nabil Saleh.Ahed is the -year-old girl who was imprisoned earlier this year for slapping an Israeli soldier.Her daddy Bassem said that although the nearest beach is only  km away, the nature of Israeli restrictions on Palestinians’ movements in the West Bank meant Ahed’s first experience of a beach was on a recent trip to Spain.The occupation of the West Bank, Jerusalem and siege of Gaza have had a devastating impact on the lives of Palestinian children and youth. The percentage of young people aged between  –  years in Palestine comprises % of the total population.Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiativehas said that for him and many others in his generation, childhood ended on  June  when the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza were occupied by Israel.The Israeli occupation has robbed Palestinian youth of their childhoods up to and including the present generation.The one fundamental question which the international community must address is what future can Palestinian children expect under the conditions of this five decades old occupation The Israeli settlement policy remains central to the occupation despite the fact that international law as provided under the Geneva Convention, prohibits an occupying power from resettling its own population on occupied territory.Palestinian family homes are systematically demolished alongside a relentless seizure of property, natural resources, water, crops and arable land to make way for new settlements.An eight-metre high wall, which is nearly  miles long, provides an apartheid cordon through the West Bank serviced by a ‘settlers only’ exclusive roads system.This system is reinforced by a network of permanent and ‘flying’ check points.The occupation has been designed, and is being strategically enforced based upon a form of scientic military precision which has no international parallel.Currently , settlers now occupy vast and expanding tracts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.In the early hours of Christmas morning, settlers protected by Israeli forces began the annexation of Battir, a UNESCO World Heritage site, by putting a caravan in position to stake a claim on that land.On New Year’s Eve, Gideon Levy, the acclaimed Israeli journalist and commentator observed that things in Palestine may appear frozen in time as the occupation continued without impediment.Then he wrote“It would be a grave mistake however, to think that everything stayed the same . There is nothing status quo about occupation or apartheid, evenit sometimes seems that way.”Levy states that the Israeli state has sought to make the colonial settlement programme an irreversible reality.During  a new phase of this strategy began by putting a legislative infrastructure in place, to entrench within Israeli law the aim of the settlements: that is, to prevent any possibility of a viable Palestinian state existing within the territories occupied in , and to block the potential for the two-state solution ever succeeding.Other laws have been adopted which aim to neutralise any opposition from inside Israeli society, and enforce absolute loyalty to the state.Legislative cover has now been enacted for the daily annexation of the Palestinian territories and seizure of Palestinian land and homes, to enable the relentless expansion of the Israeli state borders beyond those established in .When the Oslo Agreement was signed in  the extent of the compromises made by Palestinians were considered highly contentious both at the time and since. Now the overwhelming view in Palestine is that Oslo is dead.From the outset Israel usurped the terms of that agreement and then acted to hollow out the integrity of the resultant Palestinian Authorityto the extent that many in Palestinian society now suggest the only symbol of sovereignty in the PA is the Palestinian national flag.There is a deep, visceral resentment at the attempts to eradicate the Palestinian national identity, culture and history. This goes to the very crux of why the status of Jerusalem is such a totemic issue for the Palestinian people.The current situation in the occupied territories is rapidly deteriorating.The scale and effects of the repression being inflicted is beyond the comprehension of all reasonable people.Last year alone, Israeli army forces killed  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a statement from the Abdullah Harani Centre on nd January.The number of Palestinians killed has increased by % in .These figures include  children and three women. were reportedly killed in Gaza and  others in the occupied West Bank.A total of , were injured in Gaza and  others in the West Bank by Israeli Army gunfire.The Addameer Association reported in December  that a total of , political prisoners are currently being detained by Israel. Of these  are being held under administrative detention  are women and,  are children, of whom  are aged under  years.The ongoing occupation of Palestine is the most enduring political, humanitarian, existential crisis of our modern times. And yet, all this continues to happen in direct violation of international law, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and successive UN resolutions.The international community and all its institutions have abjectly failed the Palestinian people. By failing to act in defence of Palestinian rights it has acquiesced in their occupation and repression.The international community needs to become outraged at the violation of universal human rights which is taking place.The Palestinians need more than diplomatic noise or sympathy. They demand action.International law must be enforced.The international community must act in the way it ultimately mobilised against South African apartheid.A new, decisive, international initiative on Palestine is demanded from the UN, European Union , and international governments and agencies, in spite of the Israeli and US administrations’ pressure not to do so.The Irish Government should give leadership, within the EU, by recognising the state of Palestine and supporting the passage of the Occupied Territories’ Bill early in .The legitimate mandate of all Palestinian political parties should be recognised by the EU.The politics of exclusion and policies of non-engagement have always failed.However, Palestinian political leaders can give a powerful mandate for such a step change in policy and action from the international community by speaking with one united voice, and by agreeing common strategic and political positions.National unity among all of the political forces under the representative leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisationis essential to ensure that agreed and effective national resistance strategies are developed against the occupation.That would surely give renewed impetus, inspiration and hope to Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, in the refugee camps, and throughout the diaspora.Palestinian political prisoners inside the prisons have in the past shown that dialogue to secure unity can be successful.Of course it is a first principle that only the Palestinian people and their political leaders can determine the direction of their struggle. Others can only offer and share fraternal and comradely advice.But it is clear, that what has not been achieved or attempted to date is the integration of mutually reinforcing international and domestic strategies of diplomatic pressure and popular political resistance to end the occupation.As  begins this may well be an opportunity for a new, bold initiative by all the Palestinian leaders to reaffirm and renew the representative leadership role of the PLO as the fully inclusive authority of the Palestinian national liberation struggle and to also build a definitive consensus on the core national and democratic principles and objectives, which subordinates ideological and tactical dferences to the achievement of a viable Palestinian state.Essential to any progress will be the international community and Palestine has many friends across the globe.So consideration should be given to convening an appropriate international forum under the auspices of the PLO which draws together all international authorities, agencies, and fraternal political parties which have acted in good faith towards Palestinian interests and, to mandate their representatives to take responsibility for the implementation of a newly defined international initiative, premised upon invoking and enforcing international law, and for the mobilisation of a global political momentum against the injustice of the occupation which mirrors the global campaign against apartheid in South Africa.For its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.The ordinary people of Palestine deserve nothing less.In the words of Adnan Ghaith, the Governor of Jerusalem“The Palestinian people deserve to live their lives like any other people.”Free Palestine!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8760014.1546853768!/image/image.jpg","title":"traffic and travel delays after collision approaching co antrim roundabout","story":"Motorists are being warned to expect delays after a collision approaching the Seven Towers roundabout in Ballymena.A post on TrafficwatchNI said: \"#CoAntrim getting reports RTC #Ballymena approaching A Seven Towers R`bout - expect delaysin the area\".Traffic jamA later post said: A delays from #Antrim direction - Ballee Roundabout towards Ballymena - road down to one lane while vehicle waits for recovery.NI Kegworth survivor: I could hear Stf Little Fingers in coma but just couldn’t come out of it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults. The resident also believes that there may have been an attempt by someone to cover over the graffiti.Mayor Lindsay Millar said: “I condemn this act of vandalism and appeal for anybody with information to contact the PSNI.“This park is enjoyed by the entire community and antisocial behaviour must not be tolerated. “Our Borough has a number of award-winning parks, which staff and the community work hard to maintain.“Our staff are currently working to remove the paint, however, damage to the park fencing is more substantial and will take some time to repair. “The play area will remain closed until all repair work has been completed and it is safe to use again.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1376897.jpg--.jpg?1546959914000\n","title":"agewell partnership delivering handyman service to residents","story":"Mid  East Antrim Agewell Partnershipare a local charity working across Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne to support older people.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"ballymena electrical firm closes 57","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein.

Volunteers would check the validity of fuel permits presented by iniduals identied by their organisations as a priority to receive fuel from designated filling stations, the letter said. \"Details must be recorded of the amount and type of fuel purchased so HQ staff can track demand patterns. \"Training will be provided and they will explain the scheme to customers, thus leaving filling station staff free to dispense fuel and take payment.\" The last time serious disruption happened to the oil industry here was in  during the loyalist Ulster Workers Council strike in protest at the Sunningdale Agreement.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said: \"The advocates of a no-deal Brexit should be left to staff the pumps and explain the disaster of a no-deal Brexit.\"A statement from the department said for many years it had worked closely with industry. It added: \"This process is not new and is a routine exercise to bring the resource back to the required capacity.\" Due to staff changes it was considered \"prudent\" to reissue the call for volunteers."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland schools asking parents for 60 per month to plug","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Drivers entering the carriageway northbound also present a danger because they are entering the fast lane.\"The A is the most popular road in Northern Ireland for HGVs, which are limited in the maximum speed they should be doing on dual carriageways.\"Some other drivers, who may be driving too fast, seem not to take into account the dference in braking distances for these -tonne vehicles, which can cause serious accidents.\""},{"url":null,"title":"abbott labour is committed to honouring brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But I repeat, we want to honour the referendum vote.”On security matters, Ms Abbott highlighted a letter from ex-MI chief Sir Richard Dearlove and former head of the armed forces Field Marshal Lord Guthrie which warned that Mrs May’s deal would threaten national security.She said: “We believe that this deal treats issues of safety and security with a degree of recklessness.”Mr Javid said he has a “great deal of respect” for Sir Richard and Lord Guthrie but added: “On this particular issue, in this letter, they are wrong – there is nothing in this deal that changes our relationship with Nato, with our US allies as intelligence partners, or indeed with our wider Five Eyes partners. Nothing at all.”He earlier told MPs that EU citizens resident in the UK would be able to continue to live their lives “much as they do now” post-Brexit.He said: “We value their signicant contribution to the UK and whatever happens, as we said many times before, we want them to stay. We know how important our EU friends are to our economy, to our society, to our families, to our history and also to our future.”He added: “Our message to EU citizens throughout is clear: deal or no deal, we want you to stay.”Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who wrapped up the third day of debate for Labour, later mocked the Tory post-Brexit vision for the UK as the “invisible chain” linking countries across the globe.The Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury said Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had not realised The Invisible Chain was also the Spanish title for the film Lassie Come Home.To laughter, she added: “It’s no wonder the Foreign Secretary’s vision of the invisible chain has been so enthusiastically embraced by his dog-loving Cabinet colleagues.“The Health Secretary with his invisible green paper on social care, the Transport Secretary with his invisible ferries and his invisible traffic jams, and of course the Prime Minister running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit.”Mr Hunt responded saying Lassie was one of his “favourite childhood films”, adding: “Lassie of course in that story was given to a member of the aristocracy, in fact the Duke of Rudling, but Lassie wasn’t happy and she broke free without any kind of referendum and she came home, there is a lesson for all of us.”The Foreign Secretary rounded off the debate by telling MPs that Brexit would “restore sovereign control over immigration policy”.He also told Labour to “stop playing parliamentary games” and to back Mrs May’s deal.The debate on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is due toto the Commons on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"this baby has hair so incredible shes now starring in a pantene campaign","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view.

Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers.

In addition, unlike the greyhound racetracks in the Republic of Ireland, Drumbo Park received no government funding.“In the past two years, the directors invested substantial resources in an effort to turn the business around but a decision had to be taken that it was no longer viable.“The  full time and  part time staff were informed on Friday morning.“The directors would like to thank the staff, customers and dog owners for their support and dedication over the past decade.”Commenting on the closure, the Chairman of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, Alderman William Leathem, said: “Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council is disappointed to hear that Drumbo Park Greyhound Stadium has closed with the loss of over  jobs to the local economy. “For over  years the stadium, located at Lisburn Distillery Football Club’s ground, has provided employment and a leisure offering to locals and attracted many visitors to the area. We plan to meet with management to offer any help we can in helping those who lost their job find new employment or seek training opportunities.”According to company director Michael McAdam, the closure of the greyhound racing business will have no impact on Lisburn Distillery FC, which uses the privately-owned stadium for its home games. • Read related report here.Flybe rescued by Virgin Atlantic and Stobart consortium Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind. One day I might be ok or maybe for a few days.

My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

about the idea.Miss Ritchie, who led the party for  months during  , was speaking on the BBC political show The View.A week earlier she had appeared much cooler about the idea when interviewed by The News Letter.It has been suggested by an anonymous Fianna Fail source in thethat the ultimate aim is to absorb the SDLP wholesale into the much-larger Dublin-based party.And when asked about the idea of the name ‘SDLP’ vanishing from the political landscape after almost  years, Miss Richietold the paper this “would be a severe matter of regret”.“I joined the SDLP in  and I strongly believe in those social democratic and social justice values of the SDLP, and I’d like to see those values represented in the future,” she said. “I want to be, at this stage, cautious until I see the final outcome or recommendation.”But on Thursday night’s edition of The View, she said: “I think this presents an opportunity it’s not about a takeover.“It’s about a partnership between two parties of like-minded disposition. “It is a positive move for me.”In , she had declared no merger with Fianna Fail would happen “on my watch”.As to what has changed, she said Brexit came along, and Stormont collapsed.She added that “I think people are looking for a new type of politics that demands we do something that’s dferent, but above all delivers for the people”.Drumbo Park closes: Greyhound

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And that will help approximately , families a year.Ms Ruddrsquos move came as the Commons Work and Pensions Committee branded the plans to retrospectively extend the cap to children born before it was brought in ldquocruel.The committee expressed fears about the impact of such a move on the levels of child poverty.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Ms Ruddrsquos announcement on the two-child policy ldquomakes no dference to the long-run generosity of the benefit system but delayed its long-term impact from being felt until the mid s.IFS economist Tom Waters said that the two-child policy would still leave , families entitled to less support, of which a third would be single parent families,the population remained similar to today.He cited previous research that suggests it would increase child poverty by around , for a saving of pound billion to the exchequer.He added: ldquoAmber Ruddrsquos reform announced today certainly addresses the issue of lsquoretrospectionrsquo that had attracted criticism.ldquoBut it does nothing to change the fact that, in the long-run, the two-child limit substantially reduces the extent to which the benefits system supports poorer families with three or more children.The Work and Pensions Secretary had earlier told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that she remained committed to the completion of the ldquomigration of claimants of six old benefits on to UC by .ldquoIrsquom absolutely convinced that Universal Credit is a far better system than the legacy system it replaces, she said.ldquoThis is a really ambitious project. Itrsquos going to impact on eight million peoplersquos lives when it is finally completed.ldquoIt is inevitable that, as we roll it out, as we make the changes, we are learning about how to do it better.ldquoMaybe things that were proposed previously werenrsquot effective or werenrsquot compassionate in the way that I want them to be.ldquoSo Irsquom going to be perfectly bold about making those changes where I need to.Taking questions after her speech, Ms Rudd repeated her desire to see an end to the benefit freeze next year.She told reporters: ldquoI havenrsquot had any further conversations with the Chancellor so I had better not say anything too definitive at this stage.ldquoBut it would certainly be my view that it should come to an end at that stage.But Unison general secretary Dave Prentis branded the remaining cap ldquomorally wrong, adding: ldquoNow at least families who had a third child before April  wonrsquot be hit, but there are still many others with younger children who will be.ldquoThis is a highly flawed system that needs to be thoroughly rethought..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Rudd urged to build on  ucompassionate u reforms to Universal Credit system article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind. One day I might be ok or maybe for a few days. Then, all of a sudden, you might see something or hear something that makes you think you your beloved son.Landowners of town centre anti-social hotspot should be targeted say SDLP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“This might be you for a few days, feeling so low that all you can think about is him and how you lost that person and how he died. “ I lie most nights thinking about what happened that morning, I would find myself having to sit back up again as I get quite anxious and then I am the one left trying to control my own breathing.“I went myself for counselling once but found that it wasn’t for me. My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
