I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy -

a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

She had been drugged and kept in a small compartment under the bed.Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap and served half of his eight-year sentence.Matthews, who was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety following her release, also denied recent reports she had been selling sandwiches to homeless people that had been handed out for free by Pret a Manger shops. \u0027I never sold them, I gave them to the homeless,\u0027 she claimed.\u0027It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station.\u0027Sometimes I\u0027d take them to the Salvation Army.

The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.\u0027There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/08/4C02D62600000578-0-image-m-5_1525937446297.jpg","title":"EU demands UK treats Northern Ireland like HONG KONG stay customs union","story":"    Brussels is urging Britain to treat Northern Ireland like Hong Kong and accept the province must accept EU rules and regulations after Brexit.

I was sure I would shortly be killed\u0027.                                                     The couple had moved from country to country hiding from Gaddafi\u0027s \u0027killers\u0027 because her husband was an outspoken critic of the regime and branded a terrorist by the dictator.Britain told the US they were in Malaysia travelling on French passports under assumed names.When they landed in Thailand the CIA were ready to grab them in Bangkok\u0027s airport. His wife  was jailed but released just before she gave birth to him in prison in 2004 and she said the £500,000 and the apology proves \u0027their torture was not and could never be justified\u0027.International human rights group Reprieve and the Belhaj family say their abduction was a direct result of a joint MI6-CIA operation following the \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 in which Tony Blair\u0027s government re-opened diplomatic links with Gaddafi.Former foreign secretary Jack Straw and ex-MI6 chief Sir Mark Allen also face questions about their handling of the affair.Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the agreement meant the Government did not have to admit any legal liability for what happened to Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar in 2004.But Prime Minister Theresa May has personally written to them both to apologise for their \u0027appalling\u0027 treatment, Mr Wright announced in the Commons.He said Ms Boudchar was being given £500,000 despite the Government not admitting liability. He said Mr Belhaj had never asked for money and will not receive any.In statements issued by their lawyers, Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar said they accepted the apology from Mrs May and the Government.Mr Wright told MPs it was important for the security services to learn from \u0027where we got things wrong\u0027, but said they were not admitting liability in a carefully worded statement.Mr Wright said the UK Government \u0027believes\u0027 the accounts and admitted Britain had \u0027contributed\u0027 to the appalling treatment they received.He said: \u0027We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal you suffered and our role in it.\u0027   Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the agreement meant the Government did not have to admit any legal liability for what happened Hakim Belhaj and his wifeThe Attorney General said he hoped the acknowledgement of what happened and the apology would ease the suffering Mr Belhaj and his wife. Mr Belhaj - a long-time opponent of Gaddafi - and his then-pregnant Moroccan wife claim they were kidnapped and tortured under the dictator\u0027s regime, when Jack Straw was the UK foreign secretary.           Abdel Hakim Belhaj, was the former leader of an Islamic militant group that sent fighters to Iraq and Afghanistan, who would later help overthrow GaddafiFollowing Mr Wright\u0027s statement, Mr Belhaj said via his lawyers: \u0027I welcome and accept the Prime Minister\u0027s apology, and I extend to her and the Attorney General my thanks and sincere goodwill.\u0027Ms Boudchar, who was in Parliament with her son to hear Mr Wright\u0027s statement, said: \u0027I thank the British Government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the Government\u0027s apology.\u0027Sapna Malik, from law firm Leigh Day, who represented Mr Belhaj and Ms Bouchar, said: \u0027Today\u0027s historic occasion is a tribute to the resilience of our clients in their quest for justice.\u0027After six long years of litigation, HM Government has rightly acknowledged that, even in the fields of counter-terrorism and international relations, there are lines which must not be crossed and which were crossed here, with devastating consequences for my clients.\u0027Today\u0027s candid apology from the Government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal and is warmly welcomed.\u0027 Mr Belhadj spent six years behind bars but is now a politician in Libya.The government had gone to the Supreme Court to stop Mr Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar suing over claims UK officials \u0027assisted and arranged\u0027 their unlawful rendition in 2004.  Jack Straw (left) could have faced legal action by Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj (right) who claims the UK was complicit in his and his wife\u0027s abduction and rendition to Tripoli          Mr Belhaj - a leading member of the Islamist opposition to Colonel Gaddafi - and his wife have offered to settle for a token £1 from each defendant and an apology for what they sufferedThe couple claim the UK was involved in \u0027arranging, assisting and encouraging their unlawful rendition\u0027.According to Reprieve, part of the deal involved the illegal kidnapping and flying of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli.They say cases came to light in 2011, when faxes written by Sir Mark, which described the rendition flights, were found in Libya\u0027s intelligence headquarters. Giving his judgment at the Supreme Court, Lord Mance said: \u0027They allege that they suffered mistreatment amounting to torture at the hands of US agents in Bangkok and in the airplane and at the hands of Libyan officials in Libya.\u0027The judge said the couple were relying on the letter supposedly written by Sir Mark to Mr Moussa Koussa, head of the Libyan External Security Organisation.\u0027The letter congratulated Mr Moussa Koussa \u0027on the safe arrival of (Mr Belhaj)\u0027,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027It said that \u0027This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years\u0027.\u0027It indicated that British intelligence had led to Mr Belhaj\u0027s transfer to Libya, although the British services \u0027did not pay for the air cargo\u0027.\u0027 Government lawyers had argued that the Belhaj claims should be barred under state immunity.          Belhaj was allegedly transported to Libya and was tortured by forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi They said the foreign \u0027act of state\u0027 doctrine prohibits the courts of one country sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another within its own territory.The High Court agreed with the Government\u0027s stance and ruled that the claims should be struck out.But Reprieve argued that the Government had already settled a related claim out of court by paying compensation to another family who were rendered to Libya in the same \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 conspiracy.The Court of Appeal then reversed the High Court ruling.It said the doctrine relied upon by the government might not apply to alleged breaches of international law or human rights obligations, even in cases involving the conduct of a foreign state.The appeal judges said there was a \u0027compelling public interest\u0027 in allegations of unlawful rendition and \u0027particularly grave violations of international law and human rights\u0027 being investigated by the English courts.UK Government lawyers then argued that the compensation claim could not be heard in a British court because it would damage relations with the US.But the argument was dismissed by the seven justices - court president Lord Neuberger, sitting with Lady Hale and Lords Mance, Clarke, Wilson, Sumption and Hughes. Lord Mance said that \u0027state immunity is no bar to the claims\u0027, and the defendants had not \u0027on the assumed facts shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine of foreign act of state\u0027.He said: \u0027The appeals are dismissed and the cases may proceed to trial.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/01/4BE619A500000578-0-image-a-5_1525567893464.jpg","title":"Malaysian leader worlds oldest prime minister age 92","story":"    Malaysia\u0027s former leader Mahathir Mohamad (pictured) is set to become the world\u0027s oldest prime minister as he enters office at the age of 92Sri Lankan immigrants who paid up to $6000 for tickets are...Danish tourist becomes the first person to be punished under...Share this articleThe election result is a political earthquake for the Muslim-majority country, ending the National Front\u0027s unbroken 60-year rule.The vote sweeps aside Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose reputation has been tarnished by corruption scandals, a crackdown on dissent and the imposition of an unpopular sales tax that hurt many of his coalition\u0027s poor rural supporters.News of Mahathir\u0027s win sparked euphoria across Malaysia.Many analysts had thought the National Front might lose the popular vote but cling to a majority in parliament due to an electoral system that gave more power to its rural Malay supporters.News of Mahathir\u0027s win - previously thought to be an impossibility - sparked euphoria across Malaysia.

This is a miracle for us. And even though I was not a fan of Mahathir, I think he was the only one who could have brought this victory.\u0027Sukumira Sekhar lived through Malaysian independence and the following 60 years of rule by the Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition.The 84-year-old said: \u0027I\u0027m so happy I survived to see this. I wish I could jump up and down for joy, but be sure my heart is jumping up and down. I\u0027m so proud of the people of Malaysia, especially the young people and the Malays who swung it.\u0027The result is a rare exception to backsliding on democratic values in Southeast Asia - a region of more than 600 million people where governments of countries including Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines have swung toward harsh authoritarian rule.In a lively news conference peppered with his trademark wisecracks, Mahathir flagged significant changes for Malaysia, which he described as being left in a \u0027mess\u0027 by defeated Prime Minister Najib Razak and the National Front coalition.He criticized a \u0027fake news\u0027 law pushed through parliament by the National Front during the lead-up to the election.Mahathir is being investigated under that law for claiming a plane he was to travel on was sabotaged during the campaign.\u0027We need to have this government today without delay,\u0027 Mahathir said. \u0027There is a lot of work to be done. You know the mess the country is in and we need to attend to this mess as soon as possible and that means today. So we expect that today, well, I\u0027ll be sworn in as prime minister.\u0027Supporters of the incoming government took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur to celebrate their unexpected victory.People stood on roadsides waving the white, blue and red flag of the opposition alliance that triumphed in Wednesday\u0027s election.

Malaysia reborn!\u0027But Ibrahim Suffian, co-founder of the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research, said the new government will have to contend with \u0027enormous forces of inertia and resistance from within the government elites.\u0027\u0027The bureaucracy and the rest of the government apparatus has never been used to this idea, having been, you know, more than 60 years under the same political party,\u0027 he said.Mahathir, prime minister for 22 years until stepping down in 2003, was credited with modernizing Malaysia but was also known as a heavy-handed leader who imprisoned opponents and subjugated the courts.Angered by the graft scandal at state investment fund 1MDB, Mahathir emerged from political retirement and joined the opposition in an attempt to oust Najib, his former protege.The US Justice Department says £3.3billion was looted from 1MBD by associates of Najib between 2009 and 2014, including £517million that landed in Najib\u0027s bank account and a £17million pink diamond necklace bought for Najib\u0027s wife.He has denied wrongdoing.Mahathir said the new government will not conduct a witch hunt, but Najib will have to face the consequences if he has broken the law.Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert at John Cabot University in Rome, said it was hugely ironic that Mahathir, who damaged Malaysia\u0027s democratic institutions with his strong-arm rule, has returned as its political savior.\u0027It is not just a comeback,\u0027 she said.\u0027It is about making amends about his mistakes and moving Malaysia forward.\u0027Mahathir said the new government would seek the release and full pardon of Anwar Ibrahim, an opposition icon imprisoned on sodomy charges that Anwar and his supporters said were fabricated by the National Front to crush the opposition.Anwar, whose sentence ends on June 8, should be free to participate in politics, he said. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister in the ruling party, was also imprisoned under Mahathir following a power struggle.On the economic front, Mahathir vowed to cancel a goods and service tax imposed since 2015 and said the government could also renegotiate the terms of Chinese loans for infrastructure projects.Mahathir disputed Najib\u0027s assertion during a concession speech that Malaysia\u0027s king must appoint the new prime minister because no single party has a parliamentary majority, calling it \u0027confusion.\u0027 The constitution, he said, only specifies that the prime minister must represent those with a majority in the legislature. Opposition parties won more than 135 seats in the 222-seat parliament.In his speech, Najib, 64, said he accepted the \u0027verdict of the people.\u0027The National Front \u0027will honor the principle of democracy in the parliament,\u0027 he said. Malaysia\u0027s former leader set to become world\u0027s oldest PM at 92 | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0ED1A100000578-5713603-image-a-2_1525964879112.jpg","title":"Iraq used Baghdadi aides phone capture Islamic State commanders","story":"    President Donald Trump rejoiced Thursday over a report that Iraqi agents have captured a group of high-ranking ISIS leaders          Trump tweeted about the capture, which included two of the highest-ranking ISIS commanders ever to be taken alive          The ISIS terror army, created in 2012, was the most aggressive and effective rebel force in Syria before the U.S. and other Western nations started pushing back with vigorIraqi agents used the Telegram messaging app on Eithawi\u0027s mobile phone to lure other Islamic State commanders to cross the border from Syria into Iraq, where they were captured. Those held include Saddam Jamal, a Syrian who served as the group\u0027s governor of Syria\u0027s eastern Euphrates region.Hashimi described Eithawi and Jamal as the two most senior Islamic State figures ever to be captured alive. The capture of all five was announced on Iraqi state TV on Wednesday.Hashimi said the operation was carried out in cooperation with U.S. forces, part of an American-led coalition fighting against Islamic State on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border.Following Eithawi\u0027s capture, Iraqi and American intelligence agents were able to uncover bank accounts used by the group and also secret communication codes he used, Hashimi said.    One of the captured men is a top aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured preaching in 2016)Apart from Eithawi and Jamal, the operation captured three field commanders: Syrian Mohamed al-Qadeer and two Iraqis, Omar al-Karbouli and Essam al-Zawbai, Hashimi said.\u0027The noose is tightening around him,\u0027 Hashimi said, referring to Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim al-Samarrai.Baghdadi declared himself ruler of all Muslims in 2014 after capturing Iraq\u0027s main northern city Mosul.

The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.\u0027There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/12/4C0BC59600000578-5712997-Weinstein_is_being_sued_in_several_different_states_although_cri-a-4_1525952066433.jpg","title":"Weinsteins lawyer blasts critics just not telling truth","story":"    Benjamin Brafman, Mr Weinstein\u0027s lawyer, said he believed some of the alleged victims \u0027simply aren\u0027t telling the truth\u0027          Weinstein is being sued in several different states - although criminal charges are yet to be brought against him (pictured with partner Georgina Chapman)\u0027Most people in my experience, and I was a prosecutor and a defendant of rape cases, most people who have actually been raped, the last thing they want to do is communicate with their rapist in any way that demonstrates affection, friendship or gratitude,\u0027 he added.  Weinstein is facing numerous lawsuits after more than 80 women accused him of sexual assault and harassment. In Manhattan, Weinstein has been accused of forcing actress Lucia Evans, then a college student, to perform oral sex on him inside his Tribeca office in 2004 and of raping Boardwalk Empire actress Paz de la Huerta on two occasions in 2010. Rapist movie director Roman Polanski dismisses the #MeToo...\u0027Trust that inner voice\u0027: Ronan Farrow says his career was...Grand jury in Manhattan considers sexual assault charges...Share this articleWeinstein has denied that he ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The former Hollywood producer, 66, is also being investigated by police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and London but has yet to be criminally charged in any jurisdiction. But Weinstein\u0027s lawyer, Mr Brafman, said that the nature of the evidence attached to some of the allegations against him meant that any trial would be based purely on hearsay.

Most of the 12 pieces in her first collection explore the pains, pleasures and sadnesses of middle-class, mainly American lives. They are ironic, often comical, and predominantly realist in their methods. This is an urban and suburban landscape of frustrated, middle-aged college graduates and not‑entirely-happy marriages that readers of literary fiction will certainly have encountered before. Nevertheless, while some stories fall flat, others find ways to be pleasantly, or not so pleasantly, surprising.The collection opens in impressive style. “The Standing Chandelier”, a novella set in Lexington, Virginia, traces the history, development and painful finale of a 24-year friendship between Jillian Frisk, an amateur artist and free spirit, and Weston Babansky, her confidant and tri-weekly tennis partner. As the narrative gradually unfolds, Shriver moves the point of view back and forth between Jillian and Weston, giving us access to the different ways they make sense of themselves and their enjoyably haphazard lives. The reader comes to understand, in painful and entirely convincing detail, the ways in which they begin to move apart. The story’s themes – the loss of a certain kind of innocence, the need, however long‑delayed, to give up childish things – are not new, of course, but Shriver finds a way to make them fresh and powerful.Almost equally successful is “Kilifi Creek”, first published in the New Yorker, which begins in Kenya with the protagonist Liana, a freeloading college student from Wisconsin, paying an uninvited visit to some semi-retired friends of friends, the Henleys. Shriver is excellent at capturing the presumptions and arrogance of youth, and the story’s omniscient narrator neatly skewers Liana’s vague but maddening sense of entitlement as she quickly makes herself at home in someone else’s house. Had Liana needed further rationalisation of her amiable freeloading, she might also have reasoned that in Kenya every white household was overrun with underemployed servants … So Liana’s impromptu visit would provide the domestics with something to do.It is to Shriver’s credit that she doesn’t just leave things there. The narrative voice is capacious enough to see that Liana’s sins are not particular to her: they are the sins of youthfulness, and so will pass in time. The story seems to be going in a particular direction, but then cleverly shifts and finds a different, altogether bolder and wiser way to end.Since her controversial keynote address at the Brisbane writers festival in 2016, where she attacked the censoriousness of the cultural left, Shriver has become known as much for her libertarian and anti-PC brand of politics as for her award-winning fiction. None of the stories collected in Property could be described as overtly or straightforwardly political: the settings and themes are almost all domestic. There are, however, some moments when more liberal readers might feel their hackles beginning to rise.In “Domestic Terrorism”, for example, Liam, Harriet and Court’s 32-year-old son, is a model of inert neediness. His refusal to get a job and move out of their Atlanta home is persistently compared to the efforts of refugees from Africa and the Middle East to get to Europe. “Weakness was a weapon, and a fiendishly effective one,” Harriet thinks, halfway through the story, nearly at her wits’ end due to Liam’s lack of gumption. “The moment those poor migrants set one foot on Greek sand they ceased to be an African and Syrian problem and transformed into a European one. The temptation to pole those populous dinghies from the shore must have been stupendous.” The comparison is provocative but also ambiguous. Is the refugee crisis being offered as a comic metaphor for Harriet’s difficulties with Liam? Or is Liam’s infuriating shiftlessness being offered as a rather less comic metaphor for the refugee crisis? Is Liam a little like a refugee, or are refugees a lot like Liam? The difference, although subtle, is morally crucial, and it is to the story’s detriment, in the end, that it seems to want to hedge its bets and keep both possibilities alive.The title of the collection, Property, reflects the fact that many of the stories are concerned with houses and the psychology of home ownership. An equally fitting one might have been Resentment, since this is the most frequent emotional note. We see children resenting parents, parents resenting children, insiders resenting outsiders, and outsiders resenting each other. Shriver is an astute observer of such feelings, alive to their variety and complexity. When the stories explore the workings of resentment from a judicious distance, and treat it with a dose of irony, they generally succeed, but when, as in the case of “Domestic Terrorism”, they get in too close, and risk becoming resentful themselves, the results can be less admirable.• Property is published by HarperCollins.

The Bank of England has put back plans for an increase in interest rates after the weaker-than-expected performance of the economy in early 2018.Two members of the committee – Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty – said rising pay caused by falling unemployment required an immediate increase in interest rates.That’s probably all for today thanks for reading and commenting. GWBen Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes UK interest rates may not rise until 2019! He blames the return of the ‘unreliable boyfriend’ today:Not for the first time, Mark Carney’s policy of guiding the markets as to what to expect has backfired. A month or so ago it looked like a May rate rise was a near-certainty. The Bank of England had upgraded its growth forecasts and in March two members of the MPC broke ranks and voted for an immediate rate rise. As such today’s no change decision wasn’t a surprise, and barely caused a ripple in the marketsRanko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mark Carney has once again disappointed those hoping for an interest rate rise - and the pound is paying the price:“Once again, Mark Carney and the MPC have backed away from hiking interest rates mere months after hinting that a move was imminent. The MPC holding fire on hikes is not an issue in itself – the committee is data dependent, and recent UK data has been poor – but the dangers of making overly explicit statements on future policy moves have been made clear.Carney’s warnings from February about rates rising earlier and to a greater extent now once again look like the promises of an unreliable boyfriend – and sterling is again suffering from being jilted at the rate hike altar.Craig Inches, Head of Rates \u0026amp Cash at Royal London Asset Management, thinks the Bank of England has fumbled the opportunity to raise interest rates today.“In our view, the Bank has missed another opportunity to raise rates. Despite a run of soft data, the economy may turn out to be more robust than recent evidence, and the Bank’s newly lowered forecasts, suggest.”“Interestingly two members of the MPC also agree with us, while the press conference by Mark Carney and colleagues was in fact more hawkish than the headlines suggest.Newsflash: Sterling is now at a four-month low against the US dollar:Peter Dixon of German bank Commerzbank believes the Bank of England sounded rather more dovish about interest rate policy today.The forecast is conditioned on three rate hikes of 25 bps over the next three years and markets have slashed the probability assigned to a rate move in 2018.Anthony Gillham of wealth manager Quilter thinks the media’s questions about Mark Carney’s unreliability hit a nerve today: “Carney’s snap at the ‘unreliable boyfriend’ tag reveals the tension between the City clamour over interest rate changes and the real impact on households. Unsurprisingly, the Bank is probably feeling a little defensive that its own ‘forward guidance’ seems to have misled the City.As a result he was keen to distinguish between the City and his other key stakeholder, UK households. He is right to do so, but the truth is that they’re inextricably linked.The market expected a rise largely because it predicted the economy would be carrying more momentum and inflation would be running higher. Those predictions have proved overly optimistic, which is definitely a concern for households, and that is why rates are staying flat today.Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool thinks that Brexit uncertainty is helping to push Britain’s next interest rate rise further and further into the future.He’s plotted the Bank of England’s GDP growth forecasts alongside economic policy uncertainty (based on the number of articles about economic worries in The Times and the FT). It shows a “clear negative correlation”, he says (sagging growth and media angst about the economy go hand in hand).Notice, also, that - unfortunately - current uncertainty has started picking up again. If this persists, August’s Inflation Report will trim further the growth forecast which will of course delay even further a possible hike.Nice snap summary from Bloomberg’s Jill Ward:After years of playing the ‘unreliable boyfriend’, Mark Carney is turning into the tetchy husband who keeps promising to take the bins out, but never quite gets round to it.Today’s excuse for not raising interest rates is that the UK economy has slowed in recent months, as the Beast From The East hit construction activity and kept shoppers off the high street. A fair point.Faced with repeated questioning about his failure to raise borrowing costs, the governor declared:What’s the sensible thing to do? Do you act now or do you wait to see evidence that that momentum is re-asserting?“The judgement of the majority of the committee is you wait to see for some evidence of that reasserting.”So, we can all expect the bins to finally be dragged out at the Bank’s next meeting, in June? Or perhaps August (when the BoE will hold its next ‘Super Thursday’ press conference)?....Not necessarily. Mark Carney is refusing to make any sweeping commitments. He even argues that the British public isn’t too fixated on the timing of rate rises, and understands they’ll happen at the appropriate time.The expectations of those iniduals - more than three-quarters of those, whether they’re iniduals or businesses - is that interest rates are going to go up, are likely to go up at some point over the course of the next years,probably a couple of times over the next year, year and a half.”“So they are in a position that they can plan accordingly for that possibility, they don’t think it’s a guarantee, they think it’s a likelihood.”Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, isn’t impressed:Carney could, rightly, point out that the Bank should hold off raising interest rates until we have more clarity on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. But that might be too political for the governor,Instead, he cautioned:While the storms of February and March have given way to sunnier skies, the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties. Despite the welcome agreement on a transition period, the terms on which the UK will trade with the EU beyond that period remain to be determined.” Mark Carney also tried to rise above the fray, arguing that families aren’t busy trading the ‘short-sterling’ rates in an attempt to predict interest rate moves. True, but those financial instruments still really matter (as Carney understands all too well, of course).So when might UK interest rates actually go up? Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG in the UK, thinks it might not happen until November - which would be a year after the last hike. “The strong labour market, together with a range of business surveys as well as what we see on the ground talking to our clients, do not point to a material shift in the economic environment, and support the view that the weakness at the start of the year is likely to be at least partially reversed further on this year. “While on paper there are a number of opportunities for the MPC to raise rates this year, the next rise may now only take place in November. It is likely to coincide with a new Inflation Report and the MPC may wish to avoid a rate rise in August when markets are thinner and businesses and households could be caught off-guard while on holiday. That would make a relatively long delay in policy action due to a potential short blip in data.”Oh, and what about *that* nickname? Well, governor Carney looked rather tired of being labeled an unreliable suitor (a moniker that dates back to 2014). He told the press:The only people who throw that term at me are in this room.So now everyone else can throw it at me when I go out of this room.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8c5f6fdd76a89d6a3221f69d0b81ced623acfd/0_77_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df952c36a0bf6255f1431801e43d95dd","title":"cure baldness hairless head bald hair","story":"In news that will be mostly of no use to anyone but ennui-ridden middle-aged men now contemplating their lost youth in the wake of their own fading good looks, it looks like a potential cure for baldness has been found. Scientists from the University of Manchester used a drug originally intended to treat osteoporosis on samples containing scalp hair follicles from more than 40 male hair-transplant patients, and found that the drug had a impressive effect on hair follicles, reviving their ability to grow.Dr Nathan Hawkshaw, the project leader for this vital research, noted a proper clinical trial would be needed to confirm if the drug was safe to use on humans, but said it could “make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss”.But hey – whoa there, Dr Hawkshaw. Some of us aren’t actually “suffering” from hair loss. Some of us bald guys are enjoying not having any hair, and see no need for this new treatment, and in fact see you scientists constantly trying to cleanse the world of our rugged, sensitive, yet ultimately hairless look as something of an insult.Like many of my follicly challenged brothers, I can remember the exact time I started losing my hair. You may not believe it to look at my proudly gleaming forehead now, but I used to have long hair down to my chin, which I’d often dye black or beautiful, shimmering obsidian, which was the fashion at the time (for people into Linkin Park). Yet, slowly but surely, the long black or shimmering obsidian hairs would start piling up on my pillow every morning, and in an act of defiance against what I considered my own biological inferiority, I shaved it all off, and have had a skinhead ever since.At first, the sting was persistent and vivid, like getting dumped or supporting Arsenal. But over time, I started to kind of enjoy not having any hair, and am now glad it fell off in the first place. Sure, sometimes I look at people like Antonio Banderas and think “Christ, I’d rock the hell out of a slicked-back ponytail look”, but the arduous upkeep of your barnet – styling products, shampoo, conditioner, haircuts, trying to fit it into certain types of hat without looking stupid – far outweigh being able to rock the hell out of a ponytail, or any kind of hairstyle.Just thinking about the money I’ve saved on going to the barbers alone makes me weep with a weird, nonsensical pride that I can’t grow my hair any longer than Krusty The Clown-style sidebushes. Every time I need a haircut I just get a mirror and my clippers, and go at it – which is quick, painless and involves zero awkward chat with a hairdresser.And do I any look any worse? Well, guys don’t care if I’m bald or not. In fact, most guys I know either think I look way harder than I actually am, or come up to me and comment on how they wish they could shave all their hair off but can’t because they have decided to cling on to the dying embers of their hairline.Ultimately, balding is a part of life, because it’s a part of death. Hair-loss treatments and replacements speak to a grim side of us that seeks immortality, of wanting to be young forever. Growing old is just as important in life as being young. In fact, it may be more important, and being comfortable with your body as it ages is a massive part of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384498a9cf15f5bc6879f6d73aaaa5c30b8e8bfc/61_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=408660a9da060674fa57aacd2478d6ec","title":"donald glover childish gambino this is america grim surrealism","story":"In his provocative new video This is America, Donald Glover, performing as Childish Gambino, artfully uses the surreal to comment on black livesOnce upon a night in my black life, I bought a 9mm Glock 16 replete with an extended clip off the street, because I’d been robbed for the drugs I sold a time or two and decided against being a mark again, that the next dude that tried me would suffer bullets.Decades ago, that was my America. Decades later, it’s an America that still exists for untold others. And though that shouldn’t be news, it’s a truth worth reminding us. In his artful and provocative new video This is America Donald Glover, as his hip-hop alias Childish Gambino, attests to as much: “Yeah, this is America (woo ayy)  Guns in my area (word, my area) I got the strap (ayy, ayy)  I gotta carry ’em.”The film is directed by Hiro Murai, Glover’s frequent collaborator on Atlanta, and it is indeed ballistic. It begins in a warehouse with the artist Calvin the Second shown seated and strumming a guitar while choral sounds and choir voices sing: “We just wanna party.” Glover, who has been in the background dances over, bare-chested, mimicking the expressions and gestures of a minstrel. He proceeds to pull a gun from his waistline and shoot Calvin in the back of his now bag-covered head. After that murder, Glover shouts “This is America”, and the music shifts from the choral sounds to a trap music baseline.A crew of school uniform-clad children join Glover and together they perform a choreographed routine that features a panoply of dances including Atlanta’s whip and the South African Gwara Gwara. For most of the video, Glover and the schoolchildren keep right on boogying in seeming obliviousness, while a riot of suggestive of several cultural and historical references erupts behind them.Near the middle of the video, Glover side-moonwalks into a room while a choir in faux jubilance sings: “Get your money, black man (get your money).” Someone off-screen tosses Glover an assault rifle and, in a scene suggestive of the Charleston mass shooting, Glover massacres the choir members and decamps while a mass of people rush into the room.Later moments of the video show Glover and his gleeful dance crew grooving again, and also a solo of him channeling Michael Jackson on the roof of an old car – all of which is still back-dropped by symbol-laden mayhem. At the end of the video, Glover is shown running in a dark room from a blurry mob of white folks. The video was released after Glover’s hosting and performing duties on the most recent Saturday Night Live. At the time I write this, it has racked up upwards of 47m views as well as dozens of published critiques and umpteen social media posts. The responses have been passionate. Dear White People creator Justin Simien wrote an essay in Twitter posts proclaiming its artistic merits, and scores of celebrities have lauded it with superlatives: “iconic”, “brilliant”, “genius”. A smaller number of viewers, however, have been critical of the video, voicing among their concerns, the morality of Glover’s motives, the effect of portraying gratuitous violence, the wisdom of summoning images of Jim Crow in America’s charged racial climate. For the record, I’m closer to the former camp than the latter, but what’s more important to me than arguing Glover’s brilliance or lack thereof, is interrogating his use of the surreal as an aesthetic to comment on black lives. In his seminal essay Manifesto of Surrealism, poet and the top propagandist for the surrealist movement André Breton describes surrealism as a resolution of what appears, prima facie, as the contradictory states of dream and reality into “a kind of absolute reality, a surreality”. Given this definition, surrealism seems an apt tool for expressing some of the trauma of black life, one that can provide means of portraying what can feel at once like an out-of-this-world nightmare and the far too commonplace. Breton further defines surrealism as expression that is “psychic automatism in its pure state”, one absent of the control of reason or aesthetic or moral concern. At first glance, an automated response devoid of reason or moral concern describes the often fraught treatment of blacks by whites, actions that can’t be defended as reasonable or moral. The full definition of surrealism becomes a way to describe the “absolute reality” that exists at the intersection of black and white lives, which is to say our America. Part of Glover’s brilliance is his resistance to using his work to proselytize or offer advice on how to reconcile the America made of our disparate experiences within its borders. Instead, he invites his audience to examine both the fore and background of their lives, to pose questions. There’s much to see and ask of This is America. The day after it was released I watched it numerous times, each time encouraged by noticing a detail I hadn’t caught the previous time. There’s the hooded figure galloping across the background on the white horse of death, a police car trailing behind him. Is Glover reminding me of the crisis of police shootings? There are the young men, high in the rafters, filming the riot below on their cell phones. Might this be Glover suggesting our complicity in commodifying suffering? There’s the (black?) woman at the end of video, paces behind him, also sprinting from the white mob. Should I read this as the implication that black men can’t provide the protection our women deserve because we’re too busy running from angry white power? Through it all, Glover danced and danced and danced. Should his performance serve as a reminder of the role dance has played in black lives since our captured ancestors were forced to dance on slave ships during the middle passage? I’m not sure, but what I know is that the more I watched the surreal violent images of This is America, the more I reflected on my relationship to what I’d witnessed.Which brought me back to the illegal Glock I mentioned at the outset. In the midst of attempted home invasion, I ran to retrieve it and it was gone, stolen I’d find out later. In a moment that felt every bit an anomaly of my known world and fate, I stood panicked as who-knows-who boomed kicks against my back door. Lucky for me, a white neighbor heard them too, and scared off the would-be robbers by threatening to call the police. Calling the police never once crossed my mind. And that, too, is proof of America. Mine and his.

We heal very quickly.” This was one of my mother’s stock phrases (although she said “plaster” for Band-Aid), which she never failed to trot out when I fell. She didn’t believe in Band-Aids, or – with the exception of cough mixture – medication for minor ailments, and she didn’t believe in this with ideological fervour. If it weren’t for the God part, she’d have made an excellent Christian Scientist.I peered at my daughter’s finger. She did not, of course, need a Band-Aid. Her finger looked perfectly fine. She wanted a Band-Aid because it had a Minion on it and because to wear a Band-Aid is to be fleetingly\u0026nbspspecial. (Although as we stood there, I could see that her disappointment about the Band-Aid was mitigated by her interest in the word “we” at three, she and her sister’s toddler solipsism is just starting to give way to the first peckings of tribalism.)I, on the other hand, was feeling mildly uncomfortable. The surfacing of ancient biases and unexamined assumptions is one of the most disconcerting things about parenting. It is alarming to find oneself repeating things by rote. How many other default settings were at work that I wasn’t even vaguely aware of? Where, when it came down to it, did I really stand on the issue of Band-Aids? Briefly I searched myself, failed to come up with anything, panicked and doubled down. “We have very strong blood,” I said.And then, as is the way with modern parenting, I set sail on a long voyage of neurotic cross-examination. To teach a child resilience: good. Honesty and perspective: also good. But wait! Self-denial: not good. What if withholding a harmless comfort meant that when she really needed help she wouldn’t be able to ask? What if jollying her out of a perceived injury was a shortcut to lifelong repression?The funny thing is that even as a small child, I could see my mother’s life lessons coming from a mile off and always received them with an internal eye-roll. I knew what she was doing and as a result, I thought, was somewhat resistant to their propaganda effects. Now I know better. Children see through their parents all the time and it doesn’t make the slightest bit of difference. We take on the life lessons all the same.Later that day, we went swimming. At the end of the session, the instructor told me to buy my kids goggles and up popped another one: goggles at three! Ridiculous! I didn’t have goggles until I was almost an adult. Typical American, I thought, over-indulging the child if you can’t tolerate the chlorine, get out of the pool. And on it went.When I got home I looked it up on the internet. “Goggle dependency can become a genuine safety issue,” advised the website of a reputable British swim franchise and there it was, the thing I’d been looking for all day: confirmation that my instincts aren’t the result of lifelong conditioning but the only sensible\u0026nbspway\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspthink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb59b577ed0b38b8dae1ed1d8fd34a19c8190968/0_217_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323de00932ef359dd4c76409dc2a2ebe","title":"palm oil orangutans multinationals promises deforestation","story":"Some of the world’s biggest companies are failing in their pledge to stop deforestation by 2020. Don’t let them forget itThey once thrived in Indonesia’s lush, green rainforests but over the last 50 years they have been forced from their home and killed. In the last 16 years alone, 100,000 Bornean orangutans have been lost. All three species – Bornean, Sumatran and the Tapanuli, a species discovered only last year – are now on the critically endangered list. The reason? It started in the 1960s as forests were logged for timber, but now it’s palm oil.Global demand for palm oil has increased six-fold since 1990. It’s in half of all packaged products on supermarket shelves and to avoid it completely would be incredibly tricky. Although palm oil in food can no longer be described simply as vegetable oil and must be clearly labelled (thanks to an EU directive in 2014), there is no such law for products such as soap, shampoo and other cosmetics. The supermarket Iceland’s decision to ditch palm oil from all of its own-brand products was, it says, a response to the palm oil industry’s catastrophic failure to halt deforestation and deal with the problem.Red Ape reveals the truly remarkable work that International Animal Rescue workers are doing on the ground to save these animals. At this crucial stage in their existence, every life saved is vital to their survival. But if we want to save orangutans in the long term, as John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director, says in the programme, we must save their home – the rainforest.

The students responded by throwing paving stones and molotov cocktails. More than 350 people were injured and 450 arrested. Already, protests were spreading throughout France. On 13 May the French trade unions called a general strike.Consciously Marxist in its politics, the May rebellion was dramatic but not the only insurrectionary moment of 1968. In February communist guerrillas invaded the American embassy in Saigon. In April the assassination of Martin Luther King provoked riots across America. In August, anti-Vietnam war protests led to pitched battles outside the Chicago Democratic convention, and the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the Prague spring.How odd, then, to be told that the most enduring legacy of 1968 was not the radicalism of the student and anti-war movement, but the neoliberalism of the 1980s. Yet this idea is becoming increasingly prevalent, and not just on the right. The 60s revolutionary Régis Debray claims that 1968 let loose the ultra-capitalism of the 80s and 90s. From the British left, Anthony Barnett argues (in his Brexit book The Lure of Greatness) that 1968 led to a renewal not of socialism, but of capitalism. In a  article on the V\u0026ampA museum’s 2016 exhibition about the late-60s counterculture, Polly Toynbee lamented that “out of all this revolution against ‘the system’ came a ‘me’ inidualism that grew into neoliberalism”.For me, this debate is particularly urgent: I am preparing a new version of Maydays, a play that I wrote in 1983 about the mixed trajectories of those who – like me – were radical students in 1968. I am also rehearsing an autobiographical one-person show about how that year feels to me now. To do this I have interviewed others who were and are still active in the movements that emerged from the left’s annus mirabilis. It has been a sobering but ultimately sustaining experience.Certainly 1968 didn’t achieve its promise. As Tariq Ali points out, the only government to be actually overthrown by the people was that of Pakistan’s military dictator Ayub Khan. The French insurrection ended with President de Gaulle winning a general election landslide. Richard Nixon won the US presidency. But De\u0026nbspGaulle would not have needed his election without the uprising and Nixon’s victory was the result of Lyndon Johnson’s de facto resignation, in the face of protests that threatened to make the war unwinnable and America ungovernable. And those protests fuelled the atmosphere of paranoia in Nixon’s White House that led to his fall six years later.As the sociologist Stuart Hall argued, one should judge political events not just by their outcome, but by their impact: 1968 was the climax of a new politics that combined an anti-Stalinist re-reading of Marxism with avant-garde cultural expression, a general spirit of anti-authoritarian rebelliousness, and a politics of personal emancipation. The idea that all of this enabled Thatcherism would have been a particular surprise to the lady herself, who was vituperative about the 60s – blaming it for the 1981 riots in Brixton and Toxteth, precisely because of the “permissive claptrap” that denigrated “the old virtues of discipline and self-restraint”. When she set out to destroy the National Union of Mineworkers and the Greater London Council, she had the 60s in her sights. Indeed, as its economic adviser Hilary Wainwright points out, the GLC was the spirit of 1968 in office.One further, obvious example of 60s permissive claptrap was the women’s liberation movement, which proved (along with the green movement) to be 1968’s most powerful and enduring political legacy. It’s possible to define feminism in purely inidual terms – certainly, it transformed the personal lives of millions of women. But it also transformed the political and legislative landscape: the 70s feminist campaigner Anna Coote co-authored a guide to women’s rights, which had to be quickly revised because so many of its demands had been won. The militant feminists who attacked the 1970 Miss World contest paved the way for #MeToo, as the 1969 Stonewall riots against police harassment of a New York gay bar helped to bring about gay marriage.Far from dwindling into inidualism, these movements provided an organisational vocabulary for the future. The uprisings of 2011 used technology developed by Silicon Valley capitalists: as Paul Mason points out, the Egyptian revolution was planned on Facebook, organised on Twitter and broadcast on YouTube. But the inspiration lay in the silk-screened poster art of May 1968. From black power to Black Lives Matter, from Chicago’s Lincoln Park to the steps of London’s St\u0026nbspPaul’s, the form and content of late-60s protest saw itself renewed nearly 50 years later.There is another echo. The Egyptian revolution mobilised the unionised working class as well as the secular graduate young. The 1968 French évenéments started with demands by female and male students at the University of Nanterre for the right to sleep together. It ended with the largest strike in postwar European history. The British women’s liberation movement was inspired by Ford Dagenham machinists demanding equal pay. The industrial uprising against the 1970-74 Heath government drew on the tactics of student protest – the first major action was the occupation of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, to prevent its closure.At its best, the left has fought for both economic equality and social emancipation. Sometimes these strands have become ided, or even seen as contradictory. But 1968 brought them back together, on a global scale, and with a vengeance.• David Edgar is a playwright.

Rosenthal added: “It’s a bit coarser, it is not quite as gentle or soft as the English translations we know.”The Asterix exhibition is at the Jewish Museum and tells the story of Goscinny’s life and career and his biggest success: the creation, with cartoonist Albert Uderzo, of Asterix, the ancient Gaul who, with his friends, took on the might of Roman occupiers in 50BC.The Asterix books have sold 500m copies worldwide, been translated into 150 languages and adapted into 100 films. But the story of Goscinny himself has been underexplored, the museum believes.“Not many people know about Goscinny’s Jewish heritage and it is a very interesting story,” said Rosenthal. “We wanted to tell it.”Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926 to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents. He spent his childhood in Argentina, growing up as a French expat child, before moving to New York in 1945, hoping to make it as a cartoonist.On display is a copy of a 1948 letter to the New Yorker magazine complaining that he had still not heard anything after submitting five cartoons. He never made it in the US.His success came in France with creations including a gunslinger called Lucky Luke, a detective called Dick Dicks, and a taxi driver called Strapontin who will cheerfully go anywhere. In one story he travels to Africa, where he teams up with a gorilla who has taken an intelligence serum and can speak Latin. They go in search of the kidnapped son of Professor Petipois.Asterix was by far the biggest success, with its broad appeal to readers of all ages. It was not low brow or high brow, said Rosenthal. “The humour is very sophisticated and works on so many different levels. There is the slapstick element that younger readers might enjoy, but also the very finely tuned and nuanced cultural references that draw on national mythologies and historical incidents.”The exhibition argues that Goscinny’s Jewishness was important in his work, if not explicitly then subtly. “To a certain extent it is kind of speculation,” said Rosenthal. “But I think the sense of humour, the sense of the outsider, the underdog, the immigrant, that kind of diasporist experience he had is just everywhere in his output in a way it often is with secular Jewish artists and writers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f6941a03884cba26fcdcccf81da31e28c0e498/0_142_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a951d5e490b749aad6c1e81808ba1e2","title":"how are you finding the new gcses share your experiences","story":"After the introduction of new GCSEs in English and maths last year, we’d like to hear from teachers, parents and pupils A new grading scale running from nine to one was introduced last August as part of reforms to GCSEs.

A blackbird flutes as a man pressure-washes a table outside a hotel. Mating flies drift on the breeze, alongside a whiff of marijuana. A student lies flat on the riverbank, feet in the water.Punting on the river Cam has stopped for the night but one boat slips into the gathering dusk: the Bat Punt Safari.The charm of crashing into overhanging willow branches in the dark in pursuit of mostly feared nocturnal mammals is, unexpectedly, one of the hottest tickets in town. This Friday, the curtain lifts on the new bat-punting season, which has raised £36,000 for Cambridgeshire Wildlife Trust over recent summers.“It’s the best bat experience in Britain,” says Iain Webb of the Wildlife Trust, who devised the concept and is approaching his 100th safari. “The fantastic thing about nature is that you don’t know what you’re going to see. You’re constantly surprised every time you go out.”The most surprising thing Webb has seen on these nocturnal tours? A naked student swinging from a bridge. Our first strange sighting of the evening is a surfboard, adrift on the river, without any trace of an owner. “Surf’s down at the minute,” said Webb.Scudamore’s Punts, which operates the safari, has taken bookings from all over the world, with one couple flying in from New Zealand for a second time to repeat their experience.Almost as excited as the tourists is Samuel Harris, an artist and part-time punt “chauffeur”, who stands at the rear of the boat and expertly navigates fallen trees and the infamous “Dead Man’s Corner” where many a punter loses their quant (the pole) in a treacherously deep riverbed hole. It’s Harris’s first trip to look for bats. “I get a great view from where I am,” he says. “It’s a lovely thing to do on a Friday night.”A tawny owl calls and Webb deciphers the “ak-ak-ak” of a juvenile heron, unseen in the riverside willows. Then, a flit of bat against the darkening sky.It makes a wet slapping noise on the small bat detectors we hold up to pick up their echolocating sounds, which are too high for all but the youngest of human ears. Webb identifies it as soprano pipistrelle soon we drift through a feeding pack of half a dozen beneath a busy road bridge.Webb points out how their echolocation noises speed up – sounding like someone blowing a raspberry – as the bat closes in on its prey.Each bat species sounds subtly different – the high-pitched wibbling of a lesser horseshoe bat is “like a 1960s alien,” according to Webb. We don’t hear that one but we’re soon picking up the “random hand-clapping” beat of a serotine bat, which looks noticeably bigger against the indigo sky.Bats declined hugely in Britain during the 20th century with the loss of draughty roofs for roosting and the destruction of insect-rich wildflower meadows, but many species appear to be slowly increasing in number again this century.Cambridge remains a bat hotspot, with a plethora of cavernous old college roofs to roost in and plenty of insects on the river Cam’s preserved water meadows.Later, Webb takes out a high-powered lamp and sweeps it over the river. It illuminates a bat almost skimming the surface: Daubenton’s, also known as the water bat for its habit of seizing insects just above the water. With its pale belly and dipping flight, it looks like a nocturnal swallow.What’s the appeal of bats? “We’re diurnal ground-based, slow-moving mammals and they are completely the opposite,” says Webb. “There’s so much mystery, and it’s amazing how much is still being learnt about bats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a6b367e6daaf61c2b8d437c33f5a761e49152/429_164_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86de8c31438506443b214c7ec34598d8","title":"entebbe review rosamund pike daniel bruhl jose padilha","story":"The umpteenth retelling of the 1976 commando mission to free hostages in Uganda avoids all the audacious drama of the real-life eventsIn this intensely silly and boring drama, a German activist talks about throwing bombs into the consciousness of the masses. What we actually get is the dampest of damp squibs thrown into a not especially flammable nest of 70s hairstyles and furniture.So here, for what seems like the umpteenth time in cinema history, is a reconstruction of Operation Thunderbolt: Israel’s audacious commando mission in 1976 to rescue the passengers on an Air France flight from Tel Aviv, hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and members of West Germany’s Revolutionary Cells group, and flown to Uganda’s Entebbe airport, where the terrorists were given sanctuary by the deeply unstable President Idi Amin. The dramatic rescue became an integral part of Israeli pride and patriotism, and changed the course of world history – in that its acclaimed success, along with the SAS triumph at London’s Iranian embassy four years later, helped to make Jimmy Carter look like a weakling and a loser for failing to rescue US embassy staff held hostage in Tehran, and ushered in the reign of Ronald Reagan.Three quickie movies about the Entebbe raid were rushed out in the late 70s. This new one is directed by José Padilha (who made the excellent and germane documentary Bus 174), written by Gregory Burke and evidently based on British historian Saul David’s 2015 study Operation Thunderbolt: Flight 139 and the Raid on Entebbe Airport. It has been noted for downgrading the importance and heroism of commando leader Yonatan “Yoni” Netanyahu, brother of Benjamin, who was killed during the operation. The film shows him dying more quickly, and more inconsequentially, than had previously been thought to be the case. But the dullness swamps any revisionist impression this could have made.The film is full of clunky dialogue with cardboard characters explaining stuff to each other about Palestine, the Holocaust and German guilt. And the most exasperating miscalculation is to imagine one of the commandos having a girlfriend who is a dancer, currently performing in a modernist piece with the Batsheva Dance Company – and to have the all-important climactic “raid” scene intercut with the performers going through their routine. Maybe the idea is to suggest that the rescue was a choreographed display of power. But all the excitement, the tension, the power of this scene is completely ruined by this distracting and supercilious juxtaposition of middleweight artiness. Then we have to sit through an excruciating and embarrassing display of dance over the closing credits. Perhaps a film entirely about this dance company might have worked.The German terrorists are portrayed with unbearable studenty earnestness. Rosamund Pike, sometimes with glasses and sometimes not, plays Brigitte Kuhlmann in a dodgy wig. There is a heart-sinking scene where she is shown giving an emotional speech into the receiver of a payphone and then being told the phone isn’t working. Well, that is the point, and her words are simply cathartic. But if the Academy awards ever invent a special U OK Hun? Moment prize, then Pike’s monologue into the dead phone will be a frontrunner.Daniel Brühl plays her troubled comrade Wilfried Böse – the role notably taken by Klaus Kinski in Menachem Golan’s Operation Thunderbolt (1977). He looks less than completely convinced by his own dialogue, though his German accent is better than Pike’s. Wilfried is the terrorist with a conscience, disturbed at the thought of looking like a Nazi – when the Israelis show up, he is the one who tells the cowering hostages to take cover, implying a humane decency that his Palestinian counterparts supposedly lack. Eddie Marsan, in frankly weird makeup, plays hawkish Shimon Peres and Lior Ashkenazi is the more cautious Yitzhak Rabin. Nonso Anozie is relatively restrained as Idi Amin.Paul Greengrass’s United 93 got its own subject right by focusing with laser intensity on the actual horror at hand. Spielberg’s Munich had a dramatic competence and robustness that kept it alive. And Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty, about the Osama Bin Laden killing, flawed as it was, did at least deign to give us a strong, clear action sequence at the end with a sense of jeopardy.

The outgoing Arsenal manager believes it will take over from the Premier League at weekends, with domestic games being played in midweek.Wenger is preparing for the final match of his 22-year Arsenal tenure at Huddersfield on Sunday and he spoke at what was his final pre-match press conference. He was in unusually reflective mood and yet he offered his juiciest sound-bites when he looked to the future.“The next evolution? Maybe I will see you in a few years and you will certainly have a European league over the weekends,” Wenger said. “A domestic league will certainly play TuesdayWednesday. I think that is the next step we will see.”Wenger has felt a swell of affection since the announcement was made that he will leave his job at the end of the season with – most recently – Leicester and Burnley fans singing his name during matches against Arsenal. “They all love me now,” Wenger said, with a smile.The Frenchman feels that the austerity years after the club’s move from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium in 2006, when he had to manage with restricted budgets because of the need to service debts, were his most challenging and when he did his finest work.He gave a commitment to stay at Arsenal for a five-year period, which would be extended for longer, and it was a key factor in the club being able to persuade the banks to lend them the money they needed for the project.“I would say, personally, from 2006 to 2015 – it was certainly the period where I needed to be the strongest and did the best job,” Wenger said. “To accept to commit to five years when you build the stadium and to work with restricted resources and keep the club in a position where we can pay our debts back, I personally feel I did my best job in that period. Not the most glamorous, maybe, but the most difficult.”Wenger’s team trail Manchester City by an astonishing 37 points and he believes that the newly crowned champions will continue to set the standard, although he could not resist a dig at how their lavish spending has helped them to construct the platform for success. “They glide well through financial fair play,” Wenger said. “It is a club who has a great manager, a great team and they anticipate all the problems. I think they are forward-thinking and will be the team to beat next season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d02ef3d1927a987b16c2169474717b4cac559e1/0_216_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46d1d0212a1278fc698c3356e0393b4","title":"huddersfield stay up premier league david wagner money","story":"The “Ich bin ein Terrier” T-shirts, adorned with David Wagner’s smiling face, rapidly sold out of Huddersfield Town’s megastore at the start of this season, testament to the devotion the German manager has inspired at the Yorkshire club since joining as a relative unknown two and a half years ago. The reverence is sure to have deepened after Wednesday’s draw at Stamford Bridge, which enabled Huddersfield to complete the most remarkable survival of the Premier League era.Wagner suggested at that start of this season that Huddersfield were the biggest outsiders in the history of England’s rebranded top flight and bookmakers agreed, installing them, as soon as they won promotion via last season’s Championship play-offs, as odds-on favourites to finish bottom. It was a logical forecast, as Huddersfield had risen despite finishing with a negative goal difference in the Championship and failing to find the net in the play-off semi-finals or final until shootouts. And Huddersfield’s resources were paltry even by Championship standards so it was easy for anyone not paying attention to their manager’s special rallying power to view their elevation to the Premier League as an aberration that\u0026nbspwould soon be rectified. Easy and wrong.Other clubs of comparable means have been exposed as impostors in the Premier League. Swindon excelled to reach the top flight in 1993 but were bundled straight back whence they came, finishing 10 points adrift at the bottom after conceding 100 goals. Blackpool made a better fist of it in 2010-11 and played with endearing brio but ultimately failed to last more than a season, Ian Holloway’s gallant side ending in 19th place. Sean Dyche has exceeded all reasonable expectation at Burnley but Phil Brown’s Hull are the only underdogs of comparable pedigree to this Huddersfield team to have survived. They did so thanks to a whirlwind start to the 2008-09 season, their first in the top flight. But that achievement, laudable though it was, has been surpassed.Hull collapsed over the line in 2009, surviving with 35 points after running out of steam and winning just one of their last 22 matches. They stayed up but were clearly heading down. They duly sank the following season. Huddersfield have survived by showing qualities that suggest they could endure among the elite for the first time in more than half a century. That is some going given the ground they have had to make up on rivals with far stronger bases and much bigger spending power.Huddersfield spent nearly £40m bolstering their squad for the Premier League last summer, and added Alex Pritchard for £11m in January, but that outlay amounted to about the same that Manchester City spent on one full-back and less than Everton forked out for Gylfi Sigurdsson. None of their players cost as much as, say, the £18m that Stoke spent on Kevin Wimmer, and their wage bill is the lowest in the league, with no one in Huddersfield’s squad earning even close to the amount that West Brom pay Grzegorz Krychowiak, for instance. But Huddersfield have invested shrewdly and worked in a way that has shown money is not everything.That started from the top, as the decision by the chairman, Dean Hoyle, to keep season ticket prices low despite joining the aristocracy of the Premier League helped retain a rousing atmosphere at the John Smith Stadium throughout the campaign. Hoyle’s announcement before the start of the season that he would not contemplate sacking Wagner even if Huddersfield fell to the bottom of the Premier League also helped to preserve focus.Of course, Hoyle made that commitment because he knew he had an outstanding manager. Wagner had demonstrated, after taking over in November 2015 when the club were 18th in the Championship, that he is a leader of rare charisma and intelligence. To gain promotion he forged a method and generated an indomitable spirit that enabled his team to transcend their limitations, and he has done the same this season. The players he brought in last summer had the attributes and character to deepen the squad’s quality without diluting its spirit.Huddersfield will certainly need to become sharper up front – improving creativity and goalscoring is surely the next stage of their development – but the unity with which they have fought has been uplifting to watch even when flair has been absent. They have made far more tackles (715, with the next most prolific on 657) than any other team in the league.Summer signings such as the goalkeeper Jonas Lössl, centre-back Mathias “Zanka” Jørgensen and the right-back Florent Hadergjonaj have fitted in well alongside players such as the underrated midfield dynamo Jonathan Hogg and the understated defensive colossus Christopher Schindler. They were tipped to be thrashed every week but, excluding the top five, only one team (Watford) have allowed opponents fewer shots on goal than Huddersfield.It is a tribute to the can-do culture that Wagner has created, and to his ability to make small tactical adjustments, that every time it looked as if Huddersfield had slipped into a downward spiral like the one that ensnared Hull in 2009, they pulled out a momentous result. They had not won for seven matches before beating Manchester United in October they had lost five away games in a row before trouncing Watford 4-1 at Vicarage Road in December they shook off a post‑Christmas slump by gaining back-to-back league wins over Bournemouth and West Brom in February and they defied prophesies of doom for the run-in by earning draws at Manchester City and Chelsea.Sunday will be a day of celebration at the John Smith Stadium, of Arsène Wenger’s last match with Arsenal and of Huddersfield’s exceptional achievement. The next big challenge that Huddersfield may have to face is fending off approaches for their manager. Arsenal, for one, could do a lot worse than ask Wagner to uplift them. Not that he is looking to leave a club where he and everyone else seem happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1d1637f766fbbc13c9928ffa2c85eb902d6ba2/0_64_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0eff80b957bc556cba5f5e32859ebbf","title":"west brom darren moore premier league relegation","story":"The caretaker manager has had a startling effect on the players and the club must stick with him in the Championship – not only for their own benefit but for that of the national gameHaving secured our Premier League status with the great win over Manchester United last week, myself and the rest of our squad were much more comfortable in our hotel on Tuesday evening as we sat down to watch Swansea and Southampton in their crucial match and the effect the result would have on the bottom of the table.As the game progressed and produced a massive win for the Saints, it not only put Swansea in huge trouble but consigned West Bromwich Albion to their inevitable fate regardless of their outstanding resurgence under Darren Moore. The case of West Brom and especially the superb results they have picked up recently – beating Manchester United away and a strong Tottenham team at The Hawthorns – is a curious one in terms of how a manager can affect his players’ performances so critically and how, in the bigger picture of our national game, we consider and appoint head coaches.Frankly, I’m amazed we are still in the position of discussing whether Moore is the right man for West Brom in the long term because he has gained outstanding performances and results in his short tenure and the players have shown organisation, spirit and togetherness to get close to the seemingly impossible task of survival from such a grim position in the table.As a player I hear and understand the question from supporters who pay their hard-earned money, asking how it is possible for the same group of professionals to play in the way they have under Moore, when previously under Alan Pardew and Tony Pulis (both managers with huge experience) they were losing games on a regular basis without the fight, character and belief they have been displaying recently.I agree that we as players have to be accountable for our inidual performances and collective results but in football, as in any other industry, the organisation, tactical plan, culture, inspiration and day-to-day training sessions are laid down by the manager, who has a huge role in defining the confidence levels, belief and spirit within the football club.These elements can make such a big difference on the field of play, where instead of players having doubts in the back of their minds about where they are headed or even being unclear of the tactical plan, they are instead being led by someone who not only instils confidence and belief into them but can convey their tactics and methodology concisely and clearly on the training pitch from Monday to Friday, enabling success on a Saturday.Had Moore been appointed 10 games earlier I doubt any of us, with the benefit of hindsight, would have put money on them being relegated this season. This situation draws parallels with a club in Germany two seasons ago when Hoffenheim were in a similarly desperate position to the one West Brom found themselves in, albeit earlier in the season. Staring relegation in the face and needing something different and fresh, they turned to a 29-year-old coach from their youth ranks to reinvigorate the team’s performance and take them forward.If you fast-forward two years, after not only an improbable “great escape” that year from relegation but consistent improvement and qualification into the Champions League play-offs, Julian Nagelsmann is one of the hottest coaching properties in world football who in his short period as a manager is celebrated in Germany for being innovative, intelligent and fearless in using young German players while being ahead of the curve in terms of the evolution of our game.I’m not saying Moore would definitely be of the same mould and ability as Nagelsmann but why can’t he be? If we look objectively at the recent form and performances of his players the upturn has been nothing short of spectacular and I have said before that if we want our national game to improve and stay ahead, we need chances to be given to our next generation of coaches who show they can do the job. Moore has proven that for sure – and in a short space of time.The wider picture of today’s game in our country and the managerial merry-go-round that is being analysed and debated by supporters and the media needs to be challenged. We talk about the increasingly difficult pathways our young players have in making first teams while we also say aspiring coaches who want to manage at the top level should ply their trade at lower-level clubs and in under-23 roles. But the sad fact is that even with success in the lower leagues or with under-23 sides these coaches are still not given a chance at the sharp end and instead we appoint “safe, experienced” managers from these shores or big-name coaches from abroad who, not by coincidence, were given a chance to shine much earlier at a higher level by more open-minded, forward-thinking boardrooms or technical directors.Watching the emotional celebrations at the final whistle at The Hawthorns last weekend after a last-gasp win against Tottenham I couldn’t help but think the legend Cyrille Regis was looking down from above with pride at his club. This was a man who broke down barriers in terms of prejudice with his grace, poise and skill on the pitch. I hope West Brom’s directors at least give Moore the deserved opportunity to follow in Regis’s footsteps having displayed the very same qualities as his hero from the dugout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cabdccaa171ff03d0ef0e50e4f927a99e44d90f/77_787_2418_1450/master/2418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa1703f1e7935276995a27b23fdfc9ea","title":"premier league joy and despair as finale looms football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max and co on Huddersfield and Southampton’s survival, hotels, West Brom’s relegation, Yaya Touré’s leaving do and plenty moreRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Delicate, early stalks are best steamed and served with buttery hollandaise: here’s a foolproof recipe you can have on the table in 10 minutes.Cut the butter into roughly 1cm cubes. The butter should be fridge-cold, and preferably unsalted, so it’s easier to control the seasoning of the sauce. Put it in a small, heavy-based saucepan and, as insurance against disaster, fill the sink with cold water and boil a small amount in the kettle (see steps 4 and 7).Separate the eggs, and reserve the whites for something else –meringues, mousses, whisky sours or depressingly low-fat omelettes. They’ll keep, covered, in the fridge for a couple of days, or freeze in ice cube trays or bags (make sure you label the latter, so you know how many are in there). Put the yolks in the pan with the butter and add two tablespoons of cold water.Turn the heat on very low under the cold pan and start stirring – it’s easiest to start with a wooden spoon. As the butter gradually melts, the sauce will begin to thicken: do not be tempted to hurry the process by turning the heat up, or the mixture is likely to curdle. The sides of the pan should be cool enough to touch at all times.Keep stirring vigorously then, as the butter melts, switch to whisking – it’s important that you now don’t stop whisking until the sauce is ready, so if the doorbell rings, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink (see step 1) to halt the cooking process, otherwise you risk the egg scrambling before it has a chance to form an emulsion with the butter.Once all the butter has melted, turn up the heat very slightly and whisk vigorously until the sauce has thickened sufficiently for your purposes (see step 8). If the sauce begins to steam at any point, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink at once, and keep whisking until it calms down.Add a tablespoon of lemon juice, then season the sauce to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve: hollandaise will not reheat successfully, so it’s best eaten at once, but if you do have to make it in advance, it’s best stored in a Thermos flask or in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water.You may be able to rescue a curdled sauce by whisking in a little boiling water (hence the kettle in step 1), but if that fails to fix the problem, pour the split sauce into a heatproof jug, clean the pan and whisk another egg yolk with a splash of water in there. Gradually whisk in the curdled hollandaise until it’s all incorporated, then carry on where you left off.I like my hollandaise fairly liquid when serving it with asparagus, because it can be poured over the steamed spears, but if you’re using it as a dip or making eggs benedict, you may prefer a more mayonnaise-like consistency. If it thickens too much, whisk in a little hot water from the kettle (see step 1) to thin it down.For béarnaise, simmer four tablespoons of white-wine vinegar with four tablespoons of water, a finely chopped shallot and three tarragon stalks stripped of their leaves, until reduced by half. Cool, strain, then add to the hollandaise at step 2, and stir in the chopped tarragon leaves at the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1197656ebed02fb97901d6090430f64bd5efce/0_39_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352e0110deedc14e40859ea48bea5218","title":"french familys last three bottles of 1774 wine up for auction","story":"Other bottles of same wine – among the oldest in the world – previously fetched up to €57,000Bottles of wine believed to be among the oldest in the world are to go on sale at auction in France this month.Three bottles of 1774 vin jaune from the Jura region of eastern France, known as “the wine of kings and the king of wines”, are listed at up to €20,000 (£17,600) each but could fetch almost double that.The 87cl bottles have been carefully guarded by several generations of descendants of Pierre Vercel, a celebrated 17th-century winemaker, and are the last remaining in the family’s cellar.In 1994 a group of wine connoisseurs, scientists and oenologists tested a bottle of the wine and declared it excellent, suggesting it should be revisited in 100 years’ time. It was described as a “golden amber-coloured nectar, with flavours of nuts, spices, curry, cinnamon, vanilla and dried fruits”, and given a score of 9.4 out of 10.Two bottles from the same collection were sold at auction in 2011 and 2012 for €57,000 and €38,000 respectively.At the time of the 2012 sale in Switzerland, Michael Ganne, the head of Christie’s Geneva wine sale, wrote: “Amongst the precious highlights from the sale is a very special bottle of vin jaune dated 1774 … Made to last centuries when of good quality … this extraordinary bottle is probably the oldest unfortified example of what is to be still an astounding wine and another true rarity for wine lovers and connoisseurs.”It is said that the chemist Louis Pasteur, who was born in Jura and was a close friend of Vercel’s grandchildren, celebrated his entry into the Académie Française in 1881 with a bottle of 1774 vin jaune, then a relatively young 107 years old.Vercel, who came from a line of celebrated winemakers dating back to the 14th century, is credited as the inventor of vin jaune, a type of white wine made only in Jura and similar to dry fino sherry, except it is not fortified. It is made and matured in a barrel under a film of yeast, called the voile, which is believed to improve its longevity.As well as the 1774 wine, the auction includes 99 other bottles, the last remaining from the Vercel cellar. They will go under the hammer in Lons-le-Saunier on 26 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc50bf29e30b340f5a99c8d55d41ba812e781af/0_671_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42318946bac2cb57d436ee55cb8acca7","title":"arctic monkeys tranquility hotel base casino review","story":"Channelling Serge Gainsbourg and the Beach Boys, the Arctic Monkeys move on from stadium indie in a smart album that sees Alex Turner wearing a constant smirk“I just wanted to be one of the Strokes,” sings Alex Turner at the outset of the Arctic Monkeys’ sixth album. “Now look at the mess you made me make.”Certainly, he and his band seem to have traversed a far greater distance in the last 12 years than any of their peers, to the point where they seem almost unrecognisable. This is evident from the way they look – posing in snakeskin shoes and expensive overcoats they resemble characters from a film, something you could only have said of them in 2006 if it had been directed by Ken Loach – to the way they sound. There is almost nothing to connect the music on Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino with the muscled-up stadium indie rock of its 2013 predecessor AM, let alone the contents of their debut. Instead, Tranquility Base displays the same endearingly puppyish, have-you-heard-this? enthusiasm for Serge Gainsbourg’s Histoire de Melody Nelson and the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds as the first album by Turner’s side project Last Shadow Puppets did for late 60s Scott Walker. Low-slung and agile, virtually every rhythm track and bassline here could have stepped straight off Gainsbourg’s 1970 masterpiece, while Pet Sounds is paid homage everywhere from the vocal harmonies to the forensic recreation of its sound on The World’s First Ever Monster Truck Front Flip. Their combined influence is heard not just in the sound, but in the songs, which are melodically far richer and less concerned with verses and choruses than anything Arctic Monkeys have previously produced. At their best, they’re fantastic – American Sports and Four Out of Five sound lavish and fresh, their tunes and chord sequences twisting and turning unexpectedly. At worst, uncoupling the songs from a standard structure makes them ramble, as on Batphone.Along the way, Turner has had to deal with the problem that inevitably affects artists who become hugely successful by offering up sharp-eyed vignettes of everyday life: what happens when you become, as Philip Larkin alliteratively put it, the shit in the shuttered chateau, insulated by wealth and fame from the everyday life that initially inspired you? On Tranquility Base, Turner settles on an imagistic collage approach to writing, where snatches of overheard conversation are jumbled together with snappy observations and a dash of Father John Misty-esque fourth-wall-breaking (“I want to make a simple point about peace and love but in a sexy way where it’s not obvious”). Turner is clearly a very smart guy: smart enough to treat rock-star ennui as a joke rather than a subject that’s supposed to elicit sympathy – “I’m gonna run for government,” burbles the jaded narrator of One Point Perspective, “I’m gonna form a covers band an’ all” – and smart enough to tackle the hackneyed topic of social media and its impact with real wit and originality. It’s hard to stifle a groan when it becomes clear the latter is one of Tranquility Base’s preoccupations, but Turner is both funny – “dance as if someone’s watching, because they are” – and bold enough to suggest that the face-to-face contact always promoted as the solution to social media’s remote unreality is a pretty fraught business, too: “I’m so full of shite, I need to spend less time stood in bars waffling on to strangers”.The problem is that a smart guy is sometimes all Turner seems to be. The songs can feel like less than the sum of their parts: a selection of one-liners, wry observations and knowing winks to camera that leave you struggling to work out what he’s driving at – and wondering if he knows, or cares – and to locate any real emotional connection or impact. You find yourself occasionally wishing the kid who plaintively, incisively skewered the demonisation of chavs on their debut album closer A Certain Romance would show himself again. It’s an issue compounded by Turner’s voice, which has changed a lot. The Yorkshire dialect that was once his USP is now deployed sparingly, as a jolting effect: “He’s got him sen a theme tune.” Elsewhere, his voice carries traces of Gainsbourg’s sprechgesang, and Jake Thackray’s careful enunciation and chewy vowels he regularly shifts into a mid-Atlantic easy-listening croon (“a lounge singer shimmer,” as Star Treatment has it) that seems deliberately mannered, another knowing wink to camera. It’s an odd mix that’s sometimes compelling and sometimes a bit pleased with itself, as if Turner is delivering every line through a supercilious smirk. At turns thrilling, smug, clever and oddly cold, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino is only a qualified success there’s something quietly impressive about the fact that it exists at all, at least as an Arctic Monkeys album. The obvious, craven thing to do would have been to release it as a solo project, then make a crowd-pleasing album in AM’s vein. Instead, here it is, evidence – albeit flawed – of a certain musical restlessness: the very thing, one suspects, that’s caused the band to travel so much further than their contemporaries that they’re virtually the last indie band standing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b6f044aad0d15724c75bb81ee6453ce5dfcc2dd/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c830ccc0836633b35d205de4012373","title":"this months best music may florence the machine paris ariana grande roisin murphy","story":"From Róisín Murphy’s erotic disco to Onyx Collective’s post-bop jazz and Deafheaven’s soulful metal, here’s our roundup of the best new music.

The setting is business as usual – gospel harmonies, battered piano, touches of harp – but Florence’s voice holds the centre as she sings lyrics as intimate as the music is powerful. “At 17, I started to starve myself,” she sings, and outlines the vices she used to commit to fill the void – the drugs, the love of strangers – then marvels at a figure whose ease and beauty seem to defy death.

He releases music as Doon Kanda, and it’s no undercooked side project – the latest EP, Luna, is highly accomplished, full of eerie, awkward rap instrumentals, and Lamina’s raw organ melodies make it one of the highlights.The first track to be released from Liberation, Christina’s first album in five years, is one of the year’s best pop songs: boundary-pushing yet catchy, with a truly magical arrangement where diffuse elements cohere against the odds: rumbling bass, 80s boogie chords, a mashed MPC’s worth of simultaneous samples. Produced by Kanye West – a fact kept pretty quiet after his slavery comments last week – it shares the chaos of Life of Pablo, but soothed by Aguilera’s always-commanding vocals. She is ably aided by Ty Dolla $ign pushing his guest vocals into gorgeous hoarseness, and 2 Chainz smartly halving the tempo for his middle eight.Masterful and unique neo-soul, as LA singer Kadhja Bonet floats mesmerisingly around her higher register with psychedelic touches – wandering synths, bulbous bass squelches – sitting beneath her. After six minutes, the melody ends up twining around your bones, and the way the arrangement is written, with everything gently tugged back to Earth by a slow, boom-bap drum pattern, keeps everything in exquisite equilibrium.been separately ploughing a furrow of deep, smart contemporary disco-house, it’s remarkable that Róisín Murphy and Maurice Fulton haven’t worked together more – just a single remix prior to this. She is the former Moloko siren with the inimitably erotic voice he’s the producer behind everything from shouty electroclash duo Mu to bonkers boogie project Syclops to that ridiculously hot Alice Smith remix that you still hear aired today. On their new collaborative 12-inch, All My Dreams pairs filthy slap bass and giant toms with sexy pronouncements from Murphy on the way to a post-punk-disco classic, but even better is Innocence, with an acid bassline spurting between upfront deep house rhythms and funky timbales. Absolutely essential.While the hipster jazz cognoscenti are all about Kamasi Washington and Alice Coltrane-inspired cosmic vibes, it’s refreshing to hear a combo who don’t shy from traditional styles. Onyx Collective are a New York four-or-more piece who have played with people as varied as David Byrne, Princess Nokia and Blood Orange, but on their own tracks, such as FDR Drive, they skew to swinging post-bop, topped with Isaiah Barr’s melodic, Sonny Rollins-ish saxophone.Oliver Coates has played cello with Radiohead and Anna Meredith, released an album with Mica Levi (2016’s superb Remain Calm) and covered John Luther Adams’ Canticles, among his other classical pursuits. But it’s his recent solo foray into electronic music where the breadth of his unique vision comes to life: 2016’s Upstepping was as influenced by Arthur Russell as pirate radio, and going by Charlev, it looks like his second album under his own name will switch lanes again while maintaining Coates’s inventive streak. It’s an eight-and-a-half-minute journey that veers from a kind of meditative agitation with echoes of dabke music, to more corrosive depths – another smart study in contrasts.Sitting, as ever, in a gloriously personal space between double-kick-drumming black metal, heavy prog à la Motorpsycho, and My Morning Jacket-style soulful rock, Deafheaven are back with a track that has patches of hard riffing and uplifting solos, but which ties it all together in a single, overwhelming arc. Like a true metaller, you can’t really work out what George Clarke is screaming about, but the keen feeling is such that you don’t need to.In spring 2017, Melody Prochet announced her second album as Melody’s Echo Chamber, Bon Voyage. But after suffering a serious accident that left her hospitalised for several months, the release was postponed until later this year. The lyrics to its first single seem to address the arduous process of recovery and the temporary hopelessness of her situation – “It’s been so long, there must be some kind of light to come” – but the music, produced with Swedish psychedelicists Fredrik Swahn (of the Amazing) and Reine Fiske (of Dungen), is a featherlight odyssey, filled with space and intrigue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084cc1662defab260f26a2c98229e21e6ee3262d/0_117_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a480fd064d9d47a736b3eb6fa0647e19","title":"viva la diva how eurovisions dana international made trans identity mainstream","story":"Twenty years ago, the Israeli singer cemented Eurovision as a celebratory space for LGBTQ people everywhere with her winning song Diva. But, she admits, she didn’t believe in the song when she first heard itShe was tall, svelte and glamorous in a floor-length glitter gown, with luscious brown curls and the kind of dramatic arm movements that would put an ice dancer to shame. Plus, she had an unmistakable pronunciation of the word Cleopatra. Dana International cut a dazzling figure in May 1998 when she won Eurovision for Israel. Her song, Diva, had a lot to do with it: an earworm with a thick club beat and a karaoke-ready chorus that you could make up as you went along if you didn’t quite catch all the Hebrew.Dana was also Eurovision’s first ever trans winner. Twenty years ago there was no Ru Paul or Trixie Mattel the Oscar-winning Hilary Swank movie Boys Don’t Cry was a year away. The likes of TV series Transparent, or actors such as Laverne Cox, were off in the distance. The trans community wasn’t invisible, but it wasn’t the staple of the pop culture conversation that it has become Dana’s performance at Birmingham’s National Indoor Arena felt like a watershed moment, a major celebration of a trans artist on an international stage.It wasn’t without its trials, and Dana’s representation of her country created a furore among Israel’s Orthodox Jewish community. After her win, she addressed her detractors. “My victory proves God is on my side,” read her statement. “I want to send my critics a message of forgiveness: try to accept me. I am what I am.” Today, she claims she enjoyed the backlash. “I don’t care what they say about me,” she says. “I believe in God, in freedom, that everyone has a right to live how they choose.”Her winning entry is still considered one of the all-time Eurovision greats – with its classic Eurodance rhythms and typically Israeli melody, it is irresistibly camp. But Dana’s legacy is greater than the song: she led the way for 2014 Austrian winner Conchita Wurst – a Shirley Bassey-type drag queen with a perfectly trimmed beard – and, more broadly, signalled the importance of the fun, free, gregarious culture of Eurovision as an annual LGBTQ-friendly celebration.Eurovision fanatic and Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills explains: “Eurovision is about the music, but it’s also about ersity, particularly for countries that aren’t No 1 on your list of places to go if you’re gay. Dana International massively paved the way. It was an extremely brave thing to do at the time, gave a lot of people courage and raised important issues in countries where tolerance has been low.”“I’m not saying I’m Barbra Streisand or Mariah Carey,” says Dana herself. “People don’t care about my voice. They care that I speak my opinion, without fear. They’ll say I’m so brave, blah blah blah. I’m just living my life, and it’s not an easy life.”Two decades on, at 46, she is happy to reminisce about the lead-up to that magical night. Her offstage name is Sharon Cohen, but she was born Yaron in Tel Aviv the youngest of three, she came from humble beginnings. “Picture in your mind a very modest house,” she says. “We had a small black-and-white TV, no stereo and one channel.” Her first memory of Eurovision was watching Israel’s 1979 victory, which turned the competition into a must-see event in her homeland. “Eurovision was the biggest evening,” she laughs. “We waited the whole year. Everything looked gorgeous. It’s a big dream to become a singer at Eurovision. When I was 12, I would bullshit that I knew I was gonna be somebody, but I couldn’t possibly dream of this.”She recognised she was gay at a young age. “I started to realise why I liked these kinds of singers and not others,” she says, referring to the over-the-top theatrics of Eurovision entrants. So was it music that made her sexuality clear to her? “No, no, no! I will be vocal with you. It was sex! I was confused because I came from a traditional family. It was wrong to mention the word ‘gay’. But suddenly I felt free.”Dancing and singing came later, once she understood her gender identity. “I knew that, being a transsexual, it would be much harder to be a doctor, a lawyer or an architect,” she says. “In showbusiness, it would be easier to be who I wanted to be.” Becoming Israel’s first drag act was a logical decision, then. When Dana was 18, she was inspired by the likes of US star Divine (“My greatest icon: Divine’s music to me was like narcotics”) and she started to work with a DJ, releasing her first song in 1990. The name Dana International, the title of her first EP, stuck by accident. “I needed to sign my first cheque, so I signed it Dana International.”She built a robust career in Israel and won the country’s singer of the year competition in 1994, a year after undergoing gender reassignment surgery. With her sights set on Eurovision, she unsuccessfully applied to represent Israel in 1995 she tried again in 1998 with a new song, Diva. She was picked by a committee, rather than through a TV contest and the news that she would be going to Birmingham came by phone. “I was screaming and shouting,” she recalls.Diva has its own transformation story. The lyrics she sang were: “Viva Maria! Viva Victoria! Aphrodite  Viva la a! Viva Victoria! Cleopatra.” Originally, however, she explains, the names matched Old Testament matriarchs: “Viva Rachel! Viva Miriam! Viva Sarah!” “I said to the writer: ‘There’s no way I’m going to sing about Rachel and Miriam and Sarah. It’s not universal!’” Even with the lyrics changed, she didn’t want to perform Diva. The songwriter cajoled her and delivered her recording to the committee by hand. “I didn’t believe in the song,” Dana says. “But the rest is history.”The week leading up to 9 May 1998 was nerve-racking for Dana. At least her dress was taken care of she had been to Paris to work alongside the designer Jean Paul Gaultier. “He brought a hairdresser and a makeup artist. No one had ever made me up before.” When the night came, 172 points won her the crown, but until that moment winning had never entered her mind – her focus was on sparing her country from disgrace. “I was praying not to embarrass them. Israel was so tense.” Today she attributes the win to the voting process: 1998 was the only year Eurovision determined its winner purely by audience votes. “Maybe because I won they changed it back,” she says. “They were worried the gay community was taking over.”Mills remembers Dana’s impact. “There was outrage from various countries,” he says. “They threatened to not show her performance, so her win became a statement for the community.” Over the years, Mills has witnessed many LGBTQ-fuelled performances and he traces them all back to Diva. Finland’s 2013 entry, Marry Me, for instance, was a call-to-arms for same-sex marriage, featuring a female performer in a wedding dress who kissed another woman onstage. China wouldn’t allow the kiss to be aired. “It’s mad,” says Mills. “There’s still a lot of work to do there. But it all began with Dana International.”The Eurovision victory brought her global recognition, and she became the first Israeli act to be interviewed on MTV. She appeared on Top of the Pops, and at Pride with Kylie Minogue and Steps. “It was like a fairytale,” she says.In 1999, she returned to the Eurovision stage and stole the winners’ thunder by falling over on stage when about to hand Sweden their trophy. “It wasn’t my fault!” she screams. “For 20 years people ask me if I did it on purpose. I was standing in a Jean Paul Gaultier dress. The director was stepping on it. I tried to step back and I fell. You don’t want to fall in a Jean Paul Gaultier dress. You want it to stay on your body as it should be! Thankfully, it was very padded, so I didn’t break anything.”In the 00s, Dana enjoyed great success in Israel, with three studio albums and gold-certified hits. Her relationship with Eurovision was ongoing, and she performed in Copenhagen for its 50th anniversary. She made use of her platform, too, appearing at women’s political rallies and campaigning for the politician Tzipi Livni in Israel’s 2009 election.Dana entered Eurovision again in 2011, but failed to make it to the finals with her song Ding Dong, and regrets the attempt. Today, though, she is busy: she performs regularly in Israel, is a judge on Israeli TV talent shows and is never short of a Eurovision-related invitation every time the competition comes around. I catch her just after a day in the recording studio where she is preparing her new version of the folk song Hava Nagila for Israel’s Independence Day celebrations on 14 May. She has become a mainstay of such festivities. “My presence shows a different side of Israel that the media doesn’t hear about. It’s not a big achievement – it’s only natural. I represent the gay community, a big part of Israeli society.”As for Diva itself, the song still slaps. “It’s that time of year again when I start going through old songs,” says Mills. “I totally think Diva is one of the best. When you get to wherever Eurovision is being hosted, it’s the one Eurovision song that’s always on heavy rotation.” Viva la a, indeed.The Eurovision Song Contest final is on BBC One at 8pm on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5369ab1de82c5e1fd05cae1d9ea5cec6d8c1d953/324_0_4808_2885/master/4808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fc59f2abf5d3de650c81ed7a7b6750a","title":"the invisible power of big glasses eyewear industry essilor luxottica","story":"How one giant company will dominate the way the whole world sees. By  Sam KnightIf you have been wearing glasses for years, like me, it can be surprising to discover that you perceive the world thanks to a few giant companies that you have never heard of. Worrying about the fraying edge of motorway lights at night, or words that slide on the page, and occasionally spending a fortune at the opticians is, for many of us, enough to think about. And spectacles are unusual things. It is hard to think of another object in our society which is both a medical device that you don’t want and a fashion accessory which you do.Buying them, in my experience anyway, is a fraught, somewhat exciting exercise that starts in a darkened room, where you contemplate the blurred letters and the degeneration of your visual cortex, and ends in a bright, gallery-like space where you enjoy the spry feel of acetate in your fingers, listen to what you are told, pay more than you were expecting to, and look forward to inhabiting a new, slightly sharper version of your existing self.But what we see masks the underlying structure of the global eyewear business. Over the last generation, just two companies have risen above all the rest to dominate the industry. The lenses in my glasses – and yours too, most likely – are made by Essilor, a French multinational that controls almost half of the world’s prescription lens business and has acquired more than 250 other companies in the past 20 years.There is a good chance, meanwhile, that your frames are made by Luxottica, an Italian company with an unparalleled combination of factories, designer labels and retail outlets. Luxottica pioneered the use of luxury brands in the optical business, and one of the many powerful functions of names such as Ray-Ban (which is owned by Luxottica) or Vogue (which is owned by Luxottica) or Prada (whose glasses are made by Luxottica) or Oliver Peoples (which is owned by Luxottica) or high-street outlets such as LensCrafters, the largest optical retailer in the US (which is owned by Luxottica), or John Lewis Opticians in the UK (which is run by Luxottica), or Sunglass Hut (which is owned by Luxottica) is to make the marketplace feel more varied than it actually is.Between them, Essilor and Luxottica play a central, intimate role in the lives of a remarkable number of people. Around 1.4 billion of us rely on their products to drive to work, read on the beach, follow the whiteboard in biology lessons, type text messages to our grandchildren, land aircraft, watch old movies, write dissertations and glance across restaurants, hoping to look slightly more intelligent and interesting than we actually are. Last year, the two companies had a combined customer base that is somewhere between Apple’s and Facebook’s, but with none of the hassle and scrutiny of being as well known.The creation of EssilorLuxottica is a big deal. It will have knock-on consequences for opticians and eyewear manufacturers from Hong Kong to Peru. But it is also a response to an unprecedented moment in the story of human vision – namely, the accelerating degradation of our eyes. For several thousand years, human beings have lived in more or less advanced societies, reading, writing and doing business with one another, mostly without the aid of glasses. But that is coming to an end. No one is exactly sure what it is about early 21st-century urban living – the time we spend indoors, the screens, the colour spectrum in LED lighting, or the needs of ageing populations – but the net result is that across the world, we are becoming a species wearing lenses. The need varies depending where you go, because different populations have different genetic predispositions to poor eyesight, but it is there, and growing, and probably greater than you think. In Nigeria, around 90 million people, or half the population, are now thought to need corrective eyewear.At the same time, across the developing world, a slower and more complex process is underway, as populations age and urbanise and move indoors to work. The history of eyewear tells us that people do not, as a rule, start wearing glasses because they notice everything has gone a little out of focus. It is in order to take part in new forms of entertainment and labour. The mass market in spectacles did not emerge when they were invented, in 13th-century Italy, but 200 years later, alongside the printed word in Germany, because people wanted to read.In 2018, an estimated 2.5 billion people, mostly in India, Africa and China, are thought to need spectacles, but have no means to have their eyes tested or to buy them. “The visual ide”, as NGOs call it, is one of those vast global shortcomings that suddenly makes sense when you think about it. Across the developing world, straightforward myopia and presbyopia, the medical name for longsightedness, have been linked with everything from high road deaths to low educational achievement and poor productivity in factories. Eye-health campaigners call it the largest untreated disability in the world.It is also a staggering business opportunity. Essilor and Luxottica know this. It was Essilor that worked out and first publicised the 2.5 billion statistic, in 2012. “For 2,000 years people were living mainly outside,” said Hubert Sagnières, Essilor’s chairman and chief executive, when we met recently in Paris. “Suddenly, we live inside, and we use this.” He tapped his mobile phone on the table. The legal and technical details of the EssilorLuxottica merger will take a few years to iron out, but Sagnières was transparent about its mission: to equip the planet with eyewear over the coming decades. “I am driving a very profitable company,” Sagnières told me. “You know, between 2020 and 2050, governments will not solve all the problems of the world.”The looming power of EssilorLuxottica is the subject of morbid obsession within the eyewear world. Everyone knows the new company is poised to have a profound impact on the way that we are going to see. “Forgive me,” said one longtime entrepreneur in the sector. “But it is nothing short of control of the industry.” One investor described the new corporation as a “category killer”. In many conversations, people described its arrival, which would have been genuinely unthinkable a generation ago, as both extraordinary and somehow inevitable at the same time. That struck me as the kind of contradiction you come across more often in a person than in a business. And it is true of EssilorLuxottica and, to some extent, the business of vision itself, because it is – to an amazing degree – the legacy of a single man.Leonardo Del Vecchio is the patron, legend and haunting spirit of the global eyewear business. He is its Citizen Kane and its Captain Ahab. His father died before he was born his mother was poor and he was raised in an orphanage in wartime Milan, where he went out to work as a metal engraver at the age of 14. In 1961, Del Vecchio opened a workshop in the town of Agordo, in the Dolomite mountains. He was 25, and starting out on his own. The valley around Agordo was emptying out because of the closure of a mine, and the town was giving away land to companies that were willing to move there. Del Vecchio asked for 3,000 sq metres on the riverbank to build a factory to make parts for spectacles. He had a young family, and in time, he built a house next door to the workshop so he could step from one to the other, starting his day at 3am.Over the next half century, Del Vecchio grew his company, which was called Luxottica, into the world’s greatest maker of glasses frames. In an industry that was traditionally fragmented and small-scale, the totality of Del Vecchio’s ambition took his rivals by surprise. He sought to control every element in the business, from the metal alloys of the hinges to the stores where eyewear is sold. “Never assume that you have arrived, or look at the world as your only point of reference,” he liked to say. In a series of audacious takeovers, Del Vecchio acquired brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley and Persol, and signed contracts with fashion houses such as Armani, Ralph Lauren and Chanel. He built factories in China, acquired vision insurance schemes in the US and retail chains on four continents.Since 1994, Del Vecchio has been Italy’s highest inidual taxpayer and the country’s second-richest man. A few years ago, people thought his career had run its course. But in January 2017, at the age of 81, Del Vecchio announced the greatest deal of his life, in which he also secured the final missing part for his frames – the lenses – when Luxottica agreed to merge with Essilor. “He wants to do this merger,” a former colleague said, “thinking he will leave behind this great company that will last for 100 years.”When I arrived in Agordo one recent afternoon, it was thinking about starting to snow. The town rests among steep wooded hills and the bare grey sides of mountains. The blue buildings of the Luxottica factory, with Del Vecchio’s house still standing by the entrance, glowed across the river. Although the plant is now merely one of the company’s 12 frame manufacturing facilities, which stretch from São Paulo in Brazil to Dongguan in southern China, the founding in Agordo remains Luxottica’s organising myth. Every year, Del Vecchio hosts a Christmas dinner for the plant’s 4,500 workers (the town of Agordo has a population of 4,000), which is entertained by an Italian pop star of his choosing. “People are screaming and crying when he comes in,” said Giorgio Striano, Luxottica’s chief operating officer. In Agordo, Del Vecchio is referred to as simply, “Il Presidente”.For the company’s 30th anniversary, in 1991, Del Vecchio renovated some 15th-century stables in the middle of Agordo and opened a private glasses museum. The curator, Caterina Francavilla, who is the daughter of Del Vecchio’s longtime deputy, showed me round before she closed up for the day. The first glasses were almost certainly made in northern Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. (Lenses are called lenses because they looked like lentils.) But for centuries after their invention, spectacles and other magnifying lenses were mostly rejected by medical men, who warned of their unnaturalness and recommended potions to correct people’s eyesight instead. In The Perfect Oculist, of 1666, Robert Turner, a London doctor, recommended turtle’s blood and the powdered head of a bat for the treatment of squints. For weak eyesight, you might try wearing cow’s eyes around your neck.The cabinets in Del Vecchio’s museum traced the evolution from the leather frames and hinged bridges of the middle ages to the gold rims of the 19th century. There were opera glasses designed by Napoleon for his Polish mistress, Maria Walewska a pair of Emperor Franz Joseph’s spectacles and some pink “occhiali appartenenti a Elton John.” No one knows why it took 400 years to put the arms on glasses – which are known as temples, and were pioneered in London in the early 18th century – so they finally sat comfortably on people’s ears. To mark another historic milestone, one cabinet also held a copy of Luxottica’s slender debut catalogue, from 1971, when the company made its first complete frames.On a shelf near the door of the museum, I spotted A Man Who Sees Far, an official Luxottica biography of Del Vecchio, which was published in 1991. I expected the optical world to be genteel and polite, and was taken aback whenever conversations turned to the personal charisma, and menace, of Del Vecchio. “He’s the godfather,” said Dean Butler, who founded LensCrafters in 1983. (Del Vecchio bought it in 1995.) “The godfather, to me, is the guy. He runs it.” One former senior Luxottica executive told me: “Honestly, he kind of rules by fear.” Very few opticians would even mention Del Vecchio’s name – lending him a Voldemort-like aura – for fear of offending him, however unlikely that might be. One talked about “getting a horse’s head in the bed”. Another concluded our interview by saying: “You can quote me as long as it sounds like I am sucking Del Vecchio’s dick.”I took A Man Who Sees Far back to my hotel. Even in the company’s hagiography, Del Vecchio comes across as improbably driven and unfeeling. The biographer struggles to get a few words with Il Presidente as he crosses the tarmac to his private jet. (Del Vecchio rarely gives interviews he declined to speak to me.) “There were no kisses, no cuddles,” his eldest daughter, Marisa, recalls in the book. “Frankly, we were scared of him.”Del Vecchio built the empire of Luxottica on two ideas. The first was to do everything itself. After the company’s initial progression from parts to frames in the early 1970s, it set out, step by step, to control the entire process of making and selling glasses, from acquiring the raw materials to selling its own products in its own stores. No one had done this before Del Vecchio. “There is a simplicity to him,” one former colleague told me. “To him it is a very simple equation: I make the best stuff, why doesn’t everybody buy it?”For the first 25 years, Luxottica stayed on the wholesale side of the industry – “behind the curtain”, as it is known – selling its glasses through opticians to the public. In the 1990s, however, Del Vecchio decided he wanted a retail network too. First, he got Luxottica listed on the New York stock exchange, an almost-unheard of move for a mid-sized Italian business. “A lot of big experts said it was impossible,” said Roberto Chemello, the chief executive at the time. Luxottica later estimated the listing to have been worth around $100m in advertising in the US – and it laid the ground for Del Vecchio’s hostile takeover of US Shoe, a conglomerate that owned LensCrafters, the country’s largest optical chain, in 1995. On paper, the deal appeared outlandish. US Shoe was five times larger than Luxottica, and its board did not want to sell. Having its own shops would also put Luxottica in direct competition with the thousands of optometrists it had been supplying for decades. “You have to be not only courageous,” said Chemello, of the transaction, “but a little bit crazy.” Luxottica bought US Shoe for $1.4bn.Once the deal was done, Del Vecchio promptly broke up US Shoe, whose roots went back to 1879, until all that was left were the LensCrafters stores that he wanted in the first place, which he proceeded to fill with Luxottica frames. “That is exactly the formula they have used ever since,” said Jeff Cole, the former chief executive of Cole National Corporation, an even larger optical retailer that sold out to Luxottica in 2004. “When they buy a company, they spend a little time figuring it out and kick out all the other suppliers.”In the factory in Agordo, I saw dual-armed robots pinning together the front and temples of Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and basket after basket of metal frames being dunked in a series of chemical baths to coat and colour them. Glasses may appear to be relatively simple objects, but they involve between 180 and 230 manufacturing stages to produce. With its own designers, lasers and massive, quietly humming machines, Luxottica can take a pencil sketch to global production in about three weeks. “We are in a closed loop,” said Striano, the operations chief. Taking into account all the different colours and face shapes (Japanese noses are not the same as Latino noses), Luxottica has around 27,000 models in production at any one time. Its plants turn out 400,000 pairs of frames per day. I asked Striano if any other company came close. “I think nobody,” he said.Del Vecchio’s second great insight is the one that changed the nature of the optical business – and that was to combine it with the fashion industry. Although designers such as Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior had been experimenting with frames since the 1960s, Del Vecchio saw a way to take their ideas, and more importantly, their labels, to a mass market. In 1988, he signed a licensing deal with Giorgio Armani, another self-made tycoon, who had started out as a window-dresser at a department store in Milan. The deal transformed the glasses game. Until then, consumers in Europe and America who wanted fancy spectacles had to rely on staid, industry names such as Zeiss, Rodenstock or Silhouette. After the Armani deal, they could buy Prada, Gucci and Chanel, and they were willing to pay for it. “It created something,” as one Luxottica manager artfully told me, “to make the needs where probably they are not.”People in the industry observe that taste in frames follows a roughly 30-year cycle, from metal, to rimless, to acetate and back again, in which familiar spectacle shapes recur and then disappear. The trend right now is towards metal, and designs that last flowered in Ronald Reagan’s America. In the “Style Area” in Agordo, on the factory’s first floor, I met Mario Mollo, a senior product manager. “You see now the 80s is becoming very popular,” he said. “You see shallow, very wide.”Mollo was poring over a desk of large-scale drawings of a new acetate frame for Oliver Peoples, named “Leonardo”. Spectacle frames require a thousand barely noticeable design decisions, around the shape of the bridge, the thickness below the eyes, or the pantoscopic tilt (how the angle of the lens meets the front of your cornea). The Leonardo had an unusual temple, in which a curving piece of wire had to be sandwiched between two pieces of acetate. “Sometimes this one is not easy to find the right bending,” said Mollo, tracing his finger along the drawing. Like every other senior Luxottica figure I met in Agordo, Mollo was Italian, male, dressed in cashmere, and wearing a pair of the company’s frames. On a workbench a few feet away, there was a pair of €4,000 (£3,500) Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana sunglasses that were hand-painted in Sicily, made out of wood and looked like a carnival float. “With sun, you can go totally crazy,” said Mollo. Luxottica had made only 100 for the entire world. “Crazy,” said Mollo, “but sold out.”The transformation of glasses from a medical device to a means of self-expression, like clothes or sneakers, has been a source of joy for millions of people. But it has also obscured their original purpose, and complicated efforts to distribute them as easily as, say, mosquito nets or aspirin. When I mentioned this to Mollo, he recalled a recent trip he had taken with Luxottica’s corporate social responsibility programme, conducting eye tests and distributing glasses in rural China. “They were so happy having the possibility to see. They were hugging us. It was really not for fashion,” he said. “Then they started, you know, looking at themselves,” – Mollo paused for a second – “and the fashion moment arrived.”The fusion of the fashion industry and the optical business is now regarded as complete. Until recently, eye-health charities and campaigners used to distribute thousands of pairs of secondhand glasses from richer countries to poorer populations that lacked them. In 2011, the World Health Organization advised them to stop – in part because people were refusing to wear outdated styles. “Being poor doesn’t mean we want to look stupid, you know,” Prof Kovin Naidoo, who runs the Brien Holden Institute, one of the world’s leading eye-health NGOs, told me.My last stop in Agordo was Luxottica’s sample room, a broad, quiet, carpeted space looking out over the river. The room contains every current Luxottica design, arranged on various tables and ranked in order of sales. The system has been in place since the plant was built in 1972, and during that time, it has been the domain of Luigi Francavilla, Luxottica’s deputy chairman, who is now in his early 80s. “Glasses are beautiful,” he said, pausing among the hierarchies of Ralph Lauren, Valentino and Bulgari models. “Especially the ones that sell the most.”It was snowing outside and Francavilla was wearing a thick blue cardigan. One of the first things he did was to take my glasses off my face to identify the tortoiseshell acetate, which is known as Havana. His own glasses were a pair of rimless Ray-Bans with pink carbon-fibre temples. Luxottica bought Ray-Ban from Bausch \u0026amp Lomb, one of the 20th century’s great optical companies, in 1999. At the time, the label was washed up. You could buy a pair of Aviators at a petrol station for $19 (£14). “It was a train smash,” a former senior Luxottica executive told me. “They were selling Wayfarers at Walmart.”Del Vecchio paid $645m (£476m) for Ray-Ban. During the negotiations, he promised to protect thousands of jobs at four factories in the US and Ireland. Three months later, he closed the plants and shifted production to China and Italy. Over the next year and a half, Luxottica withdrew Ray-Ban from 13,000 retail outlets, hiked their prices and radically improved the quality: increasing the layers of lacquer on a pair of Wayfarers from two to 31. In 2004, to the disbelief of many of his subordinates, del Vecchio decided that Ray-Ban, which had been invented for American pilots in the 1930s, should branch out from sunglasses into optical lenses, too. “A lot of us were sceptical. Really? Ray. Ban. Banning rays from the sun?” the former manager said. “But he was right.”How did just two companies – one in frames, and one in lenses – come to dominate something as generic, as obvious, as glasses? It’s almost as if the world had one manufacturer for pens, and another for ink. The conditions that have allowed for the rise of Essilor and Luxottica are rooted, deep down, in the way spectacles are sold. Until the end of the 19th century, you could buy a cheap pair of glasses – for reading or for distance – out of a rack in Woolworth’s, or from a jewellery shop, or a guy in the street. Eyewear was a craft of tinkerers and inventors. “I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles,” Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on Christmas Eve 1666, “to see whether they will help my eyes or no.” (They didn’t Pepys’ failing eyesight forced him to give up his journal three years later.)It was the birth of the optometry profession, around 1900, that changed things. This was a new breed of sober, respectable spectacle-sellers – not unlike pharmacists – who wanted to standardise eye tests and to restrict the sale of glasses to licensed professionals. Their aim, for the most part, was to raise standards. Eyeglass pedlars in the 18th and 19th centuries were notorious for scams and faulty lenses. But there was also another compelling reason to take a cheap, widely available product and put it in the hands of a few authorised sellers – and that was to make money.The first opticians had a tough time of it. They were disdained by ophthalmologists – proper eye doctors, who had trained in hospitals and considered themselves above the tawdry trade in glasses. The first optometry course in the US was taught at Columbia University’s physics department because it was not allowed inside the medical school. (A remnant of this prejudice still holds: within the optical industry, optometrists are always being teased for their chippiness and self-importance. “One step above dermatology,” a former Luxottica executive sniped to me).But the new professionals persevered and, in a way, the story of optometry for much of the 20th century was of finding new ways to protect their patch. Across Europe and in the US, optometry laws and regulations were passed to control the prescription and selling of eyewear. Many of these had a “doctorly” aspect, but they also had the effect of creating a highly opaque marketplace. For a long time, opticians fought all forms of advertising, for example, which might force them to spell out their prices and allow customers to shop around. In some places, this reached ridiculous extremes: in Kentucky, for a time, optometrists’ signs could not be more than four inches high. Under Britain’s Opticians Act of 1958, the display of prices was banned altogether, which meant that opticians were more or less free to make them up on the spot. “The price would come from a little black book,” one veteran practitioner told me. “There was a lot of sharp practice around.”This was when Essilor came on the scene. In 1972, Essel and Silor, two French optical companies, merged and began sell aggressively into the US market. Essilor specialised in plastic lenses, which were replacing glass, and it also had a magical product: “Varilux”, the world’s first progressive lens, invented by an Essel engineer named Bernard Maitenaz in 1959. Progressive lenses allow people who are both long- and shortsighted – typically older customers – to combine their prescriptions into a single, graduated lens. The early Varilux models were experimental and not everyone could adapt to them, but they were probably the most important innovation in eyewear since the invention of bifocals around the time of the French revolution. The company set out to make sure that Varilux and the rest of its products (Essilor’s current sales manual runs to around 400 pages) were sold in every optometrist in the world.Lenses are the pixie dust of the optical business. Barely anyone knows what they are made of, how they are constructed and, especially at the high end, exactly how they work. For the last half century, persuading opticians to prescribe Essilor, as opposed to Hoya or Zeiss, the company’s main rivals, has been painstaking, face-to-face work. One British optician, who stocks Essilor, described it to me this way: “Is there a difference between an Audi, a BMW or a Mercedes? Probably not. But you prefer that badge to that badge, or the way they win hearts and minds.” For years, the company has brought opticians to Paris and its Essilor Academy, where they are wined and dined and taught about its latest products. “It’s not really bribes it’s the way it works,” one industry veteran told me.And when all else fails, Essilor – like its rivals, and like all wholesalers – uses financial incentives to keep its customers satisfied. Opticians and industry analysts that I spoke to for this article described how Essilor uses so-called “spiff money” – offering stores large, multi-year discounts and cash bonuses for selling its products – in order to squeeze out the competition. “Essilor wants to dominate this industry worldwide,” one retailer told me. “They are actually a well run company. They are not a ruthless company. But they get away with all this crap which in any other industry would be anti-consumer.”Some opticians call Essilor “The Big E”. The company boasts of supplying between 300,000 and 400,000 stores around the world – three or four times as many as Luxottica. “The strategy has to be absolutely global,” Sagnières, the chief executive, told me. “Not just for the rich or poor.” The company has not restricted itself to lenses by any means. If Luxottica has spent the last quarter of a century buying up the most conspicuous elements of the optical business (the frames, the brands and the high-street chains) then Essilor has busied itself in the invisible parts, acquiring lens manufacturers, instrument makers, prescription labs (where glasses are put together) and the science of sight itself.The company holds more than 8,000 patents and funds university ophthalmology chairs around the world. In deals that rarely make the business pages, Essilor buys up Belgian optical laboratories, Chinese resin manufacturers, Israeli instrument makers and British e-commerce websites. You can find threads on optometrist message boards with headings like “Essilor Has Purchased and Now Owns (Insert Company Name Here)”, which attempt to record all the independent lens makers and laboratories that used to exist. Within the industry, the Big E is generally considered less rapacious than Del Vecchio’s Luxottica people regard it instead as a kind of unstoppable, enveloping tide.The companies saw themselves differently too. “I think Essilor, while not a model company by any means, has a moral purpose,” the former manager said. “With Luxottica, it’s just lip service. It is all about domination.” The most infamous Luxottica deals carried an edge of brutality. In 2001, the company clashed with Oakley, the world’s hottest make of sunglasses at the time. Luxottica had just bought Sunglass Hut, which sold a third of the US’s sunglasses, and Del Vecchio demanded that all its suppliers drop their prices. Oakley refused. In the summer of 2001, the company’s founder Jim Jannard flew to Milan to meet Del Vecchio and strike a deal. Jannard had founded Oakley out of the back of his car in 1975. According to Forbes magazine, at the end of their conversation, he said he hoped the two men would one day be friends. “We will never be friends,” Del Vecchio reportedly replied.After Oakley sued in 2001, Luxottica issued a statement “denying the allegations in Oakley’s complaint in all material respects” and the case was settled out of court. But Luxottica won the war, buying Jannard’s company for $2.1bn (£1.5bn) in 2007.By that time, Del Vecchio appeared ready to retire. In the summer of 2004, as he approached his 70th birthday, Luxottica’s founder handed over day-to-day control of the company to Andrea Guerra, a young chief executive he hired from Indesit, the Italian white goods company. Under Guerra, Luxottica rationalised its manufacturing, shifting more production to China. It also became more stable and predictable. The share price trebled. But according to several former executives who were close to Guerra, he was opposed to any deal with Essilor, seeing the company as a long-term rival. (Guerra declined to speak with me). “He did not want to merge with Essilor,” a colleague said. “He wanted to protect us in a different way.”In 2014, however, Del Vecchio came back to work. He was 79. “We were all pretty shocked,” a former senior Italian executive told me. But it became clear that Del Vecchio was worried about what would happen to Luxottica when he dies. “His most precious child is this company,” the US manager told me. Del Vecchio has six children from four marriages to three women (he remarried his second wife, Nicoletta Zampillo, in 2010) but he has always insisted they will never succeed him. According to several senior figures at Luxottica, Del Vecchio came to believe that folding Luxottica into Essilor was the best way for his work to endure, and informal talks between the two companies began.In many ways, the final chapter of Del Vecchio’s rule at Luxottica has been chaotic and disorienting. Guerra was soon forced out. After that, Del Vecchio went through four chief executives in three years. In his early 80s, he is no longer the force that he once was. Subordinates told me that Del Vecchio can no longer work a full week and sometimes loses his place in meetings, while demanding to sign off on decisions as small as the floor-plans of new Luxottica stores. Dozens of senior managers have left. “He really doesn’t trust anyone,” one told me.But throughout his shaky return, Del Vecchio kept his eyes on the prize, meeting in secret with Sagnières, the CEO and chairman of Essilor, until, by the summer of 2016, Sagnières said, “it was obvious” that the deal would go ahead. When the two men announced the formation of the combined company on 16 January last year in a call to investors, Del Vecchio’s voice came on the line. “I’m very pleased to be here with you today,” he said, “to present the achievement of a lifetime dream.”Over the coming decades, EssilorLuxottica will have the power to decide how billions of people will see, and what they can expect to pay for it. Public health systems are always likely to have more urgent problems than poor eyesight: until 2008, the World Health Organization did not measure rates of myopia and presbyopia at all. The combined company can choose to interpret its mission more or less however it wants. It could share new technologies, screen populations for eye problems and flood the world with good-quality, affordable eyewear or it could use its commercial dominance to choke supply, jack up prices and make billions. It could go either way.The bigger picture takes a moment to discern. Late last year, I visited Britain’s most important optical collection, which is kept in the basement of the College of Optometrists, a townhouse around the corner from Charing Cross Station. For the last 19 years, Neil Handley, the college’s historian, has been cataloguing 27,000 items donated by opticians and eyewear manufacturers, discovering the story of the industry as he goes along. “It’s under the radar,” he said. “It’s not something that is talked about.” When I asked Handley about the creation of EssilorLuxottica, he pointed to an old display of British spectacle parts, made by a firm called Hadley in Surrey in the 1930s. Until the 1970s, and the rise of cheap manufacturing in China, Britain used to have hundreds of frame-makers up and down the country.Today it has four.“What you are seeing is a potential monopoly, and the risk that brings,” said Handley. While it’s easy to fixate on the brands and the profits of the giants of the optical sector, the industry as a whole must expand dramatically in order to serve the world’s growing, ageing populations and increasing myopia among the young. “The danger is if their proposed answer to these problems turns out not to be the answer,” said Handley. “They have stifled all opposition, and so nobody else has the chance to come up with the right answer.” The stakes are highest in parts of the world that currently do not have anything like enough access to eyewear – what the industry calls the “white spaces” of Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia.“It is always better if there is more ersity in the market, and less dominance,” said Prof Naidoo, of the Brien Holden Institute, about the impact of the merger. “I don’t think anyone can argue with that.” In 2013, Naidoo was one of the authors on a groundbreaking paper that forecast that half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050 – almost 5 billion people. In the course of a single generation, across the world, from Inuit communities in Alaska to secondary-school students in Northern Ireland, researchers have recorded a rough doubling in the number of people who become short-sighted as children.The main reason, as far as anyone can agree, is a reduction in the time that they spend outdoors. Sunlight helps to moderate levels of dopamine, which in turn influence the development of the eye. Too much dopamine means eyeballs grow too long, and become oblong in shape, focusing light in front of the retina, rather than on it. Vision campaigners forecast that the myopia epidemic will put enormous strain on health systems across the developing world, which are already unable to equip their populations with a medical device that has been around since the Middle Ages. “We are barely managing in healthcare systems to provide eyecare,” said Naidoo. He corrected himself. “Not barely. We are not managing. Can you imagine, when those numbers are doubling and tripling, what is going to happen?”Naidoo was reluctant to criticise EssilorLuxottica, however. In part that is because Essilor is the world’s leading commercial funder of research into eye health, and a prominent force in improving access to corrective lenses. (Naidoo sits on the board of the company’s Vision Impact Institute in Paris.) Essilor’s €200m R\u0026ampD budget is three times the size of the rest of the industry combined, and it has a ision called 2.5 New Vision Generation, named for the 2.5 billion people who currently need glasses but don’t have them. The company is investing in schemes such as mobile optometry, putting eye-health workers on motorbikes in Indonesia at network of around 4,000 village-level optical stores in India door-to-door salespeople in the favelas in Brazil and working with the Liberian health system to get its products to what it calls the “base of the pyramid”. Last month, Essilor pledged to provide 200m pairs of free ophthalmic lenses to the estimated 900 million people living in the Commonwealth without access to glasses.In some of the least-served markets in the world, Essilor is more or less the only game in town. In 2016, the company opened an office in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of 78 million people and 200 optical stores. Last year, Essilor acquired a prescription laboratory in Ethiopia, which currently has roughly one ophthalmologist for every million people. (In European countries, the ratio is about a hundred times smaller.) In places like these, all that eye-health campaigners can do is watch, and hope. “If the merged organisation decreases that investment, that will be a tragedy,” said Naidoo. “And that risk is there, you know. We can just hope that the merged organisation will see there is an opportunity to grow more, rather than less.”No one at Luxottica was willing to speak in detail about its plans for the merged company. It was a different story when I visited Essilor’s global headquarters, which is on a quiet street of apartment blocks in Charenton-le-Pont, in south-east Paris. The company’s senior executives are, as a rule, noticeably more nerdy and less well-dressed than their Italian counterparts, but they are much more comfortable in their role as titans of the global optical industry. Sagnières, the company’s 62-year-old chief executive and chairman, had the guileless glee of a high-school geography teacher whose class had just aced their exams. “I won!” he said, describing the deal with Luxottica. “Anything can happen. I won already. You won. Your kids won! Seriously, this is how it is.”Sagnières told me that the company has calculated – on the basis that a simple pair of glasses costs €5 – that the world can be supplied with eyewear for around €500m a year for the next 30 years. Just as importantly, any investment that EssilorLuxottica ploughs into the bottom end of the market is likely to pay off in the end. “We know that in three or five or 10 years, one day their life will have changed that much that they will afford to pay $50 for a better lens or $50 for branded frames,” said Sagnières. “I am fine with that.”A few days later, I visited one of Essilor’s research facilities in a former lens factory in Créteil, on the southern edge of the city. In a room full of brightly coloured furniture and signs that said things like “How can boomers enjoy their vision in all light conditions?” I met Dr Norbert Gorny, the company’s head of R\u0026ampD. Gorny is a tall, direct, German veteran of the optical scene, who explained that Essilor has spent much of the last decade expanding what it calls “the acuity corridor” on its progressive lenses, to help people read digital devices as they move around, compared to the more static way we used to read books and newspapers. But the company is increasingly keen to reach what it calls its “Next Generation Consumers” – people in the developing world who don’t wear glasses yet. Gorny called them “The Uncorrected”.“We do things for the 2.5 billion uncorrected,” he said. “But we also do things for people’s needs that are not already expressed.” During the afternoon, he showed me rooms where researchers put on motion sensors, as if they are in a Hollywood studio, to measure the depth of vision required for everyday tasks. Gorny also talked teasingly about new lenses that the company is developing with unnamed tech companies to supersede Google’s failed “Google glass” project of a decade ago. This time around, the idea is to project information from the internet – maps, messages, and Twitter, I suppose – directly on to the back of people’s eyes. “You can read easily – always sharp – information about where to go, the email that you did not want to miss,” said Gorny. “I leave it to your fantasy.”In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson’s book about innovation, he describes the crude reading lenses of medieval Europe as the first piece of technology “since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times, that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.” It was possible, listening to Gorny and thinking of the teenagers of Seoul, urbanising populations in Africa, and people walking through European cities with their eyes fixed to their phones, to imagine a point where more or less the whole of humanity is watching the world through intermediating screens on their eyes. I asked Gorny whether he thought the 21st century, with its demographic changes, myopia epidemic and urge for digital information, would bring about a second optical revolution, in the manner of Germany’s printing presses in the 15th century. Will EssilorLuxottica become the Facebook of seeing? “I don’t know whether we are starting a revolution, witnessing a major change like we witnessed 500 years ago,” Gorny said. “What I believe is we are in the right industry at the right time.”The question is whether there is anyone, beyond its shareholders, that will be able to hold EssilorLuxottica to account. I’m not sure there is. The next few years might be rocky, as the new company grapples with its size and attempts to find a new leader who can define the corporation and its ultimate goals under the fading shadow of Del Vecchio. But after that, the field is open and the fundamentals are clear.On my way back to London, Gorny gave me a lift to the station. “There is nothing close to that firepower once the combination is done,” he said. “You have the global footprint. You can play all the courts.” And I thought about how one of the telling aspects of wearing glasses is that they help you notice everything else – and for the most part, see the world as it actually is – but it is only occasionally, through a chance reflection, or when you really take a moment to stop and look, that you see what is sitting on the top of your nose.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757fab38ca84b097fa32e68f4da28b77f0e4711f/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7755ed90250663d304ce085d8beeac44 1760w","title":"andy burnham says labour hounded debbie abrahams out","story":"Andy Burnham, the former health secretary, has accused Labour of “hounding out” the shadow work and pensions minister, Debbie Abrahams.Abrahams was sacked on Tuesday after an investigation into allegations of bullying that she insists was not conducted thoroughly or fairly. She strongly denies the allegations.Burnham, who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, was speaking on his regular BBC Radio Manchester programme on Wednesday. “It feels to me like she’s almost been kind of hounded out of her position and I have a huge amount of sympathy for her,” he said.Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said after her dismissal that she had experienced “aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional” behaviour from “certain iniduals” in Jeremy Corbyn’s office. She said she would make a formal complaint to the party and the parliamentary authorities.Burnham said he had been absolutely astonished by Abrahams’ sacking. “That is not the Debbie Abrahams that I know. She is one of the kindest, warmest most decent people you could ever hope to meet,” he said.“If Debbie is saying the investigation hasn’t been fair or thorough then I believe her. I think this matter now has to be put to the NEC to have independently adjudicated.“I’ve been in the cabinet and shadow cabinet and I’ve never seen someone taken out of a cabinet or shadow cabinet job in this way, and I’m very worried about it. If there are allegations, make sure they’re fairly investigated ... I find it very very sad that we’re in this position.”The party’s defenders say that there would be no reason to pursue charges unless there were allegations. Members of the shadow cabinet serve entirely at the discretion of the party leader, who can hire and fire as he sees appropriate. On Tuesday, Abrahams said: “I strongly refute the allegations of bullying made against me. I believe the investigation was not thorough, fair or independent. I will continue to represent the people of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and to hold this government to account, from the backbenches.”There were reports that several allegations of bullying were made against Abrahams, and the  understands the initial investigation was as a question of good employment practice.Only after an internal human resources investigation upheld the complaints was her conduct referred to the NEC, as all those involved were Labour party members.The Labour backbencher John Woodcock was suspended from the party last week over sexual harassment claims, which he denies.The Barrow MP, a fierce critic of Corbyn, has also questioned the “integrity of the process” that led to the charges against him being made public during a “politically charged time”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c7d2b9efcdda9c4f5471267b2bd89db7ea288c4/24_0_3451_2070/master/3451.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716c8f617e54dcc05177f8446296f5c9","title":"tories accused of subverting democracy by not tabling brexit debates","story":"Commons schedule has no timings for return of EU withdrawal bill or news of other key Brexit billsLabour has accused the government of “effectively subverting democracy” after an announcement of coming government business made no mention of any major Brexit-related legislation to be debated in the House of Commons.Announcing the Commons schedule for the next fortnight, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, gave no timings for the return of the EU withdrawal bill from the Lords, or any news on three other key Brexit-connected bills.The inaction will reinforce the sense of a government gridlocked over the Brexit process, with no agreement in cabinet over a future customs deal with the EU, and speculation ministers might seek to delay decisions still further.This has prompted speculation that a transition period could be extended, in part to allow more time for a new customs arrangement. On Thursday, Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former joint chief of staff, argued that this could happen.Downing Street has rejected the idea. “We reached an agreement with the EU on the implementation period – that agreement is clear that it will end in December 2020. We have been clear we are leaving the customs union in December 2020,” Theresa May’s spokesman said. The further delays on Brexit legislation reinforces the belief that ministers hope to avoid any Commons defeats by putting off any big decisions by MPs until the government has finalised its strategy for exiting the EU.The announcement of a Commons timetable with no Brexit progress, and instead a series of general debates on subjects such as housing and homophobia, brought accusations from Leadsom’s Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, that the government was being cynical in trying to ward off rebellions.The EU withdrawal bill, during which the Lords have inflicted 14 defeats on the government over amendments, has its third reading in the upper house next Wednesday. However, Leadsom gave no information as to when the amendments would be considered again by MPs, when there would be a series of potentially crucial votes on areas including future trade and customs arrangements, and a final say for MPs on an eventual deal.There was also no information about progress for the trade bill and customs bill – Leadsom said this would happen “in due course” – or when a promised bill to enshrine the departure agreement in UK law would be introduced.“Can the leader confirm that the government is not being cynical and parking the trade and customs bills and the EU withdrawal bill, and introducing the legislation to enact EU law under the withdrawal and implementation bill, until after the negotiations are complete so as to avoid any rebellions?” Vaz said.“This is unprecedented, the government is effectively subverting democracy. The government has said they want to extend the session of parliament, owing to heavy legislation, and yet not tabling any important legislation.”Leadsom responded by saying that the withdrawal bill would come back to the Commons after its third reading in the Lords for the amendments to be “very closely” considered, but gave no date.She said: “Other EU Brexit bills will be coming forward in due course also. There is no hold-up. As the honourable lady and all honourable members will appreciate, there are very complex negotiations under way, and it’s right that we bring forward these bills at the appropriate time, as indeed we will do.”Asked again on the issue by the Lib Dems’ Alistair Carmichael, Leadsom said the government did not want to “get ahead of the negotiation, or indeed the policy proposals coming forward from government”. She added: “Therefore that timing is very much subject to the overall consideration of the best way that we can leave the European Union with a good deal for both the United Kingdom and for our EU friends and neighbours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661e22d32187176e616c759fb0cb2c3f4f65d301/0_156_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2bcef7735f9b168d5756706373eb716","title":"david goodall australias oldest scientist ends his own life at 104","story":"Goodall ate fish and chips and cheesecake and listened to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in final hoursAustralia’s oldest scientist, David Goodall, has ended his own life at a clinic in Switzerland, surrounded by family and while listening to Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.The British-born 104-year-old professor was forced to travel on a one-way ticket from his home in Western Australia to Switzerland where liberal assisted dying laws allowed him to end his life legally, in contrast to Australia where it remains forbidden.In his final hours, Goodall enjoyed his favourite dinner: fish and chips and cheesecake. And in his final minutes, he listened to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, best known for its last movement Ode to Joy, reportedly passing away shortly after the piece of music finished.To end his own life, Goodall had to turn a wheel that allowed a lethal infusion to flow into his bloodstream through a cannula on his arm. Assisted dying, where patients take the final action to end their lives, is legal in Canada, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland and parts of the US.Goodall, a botanist and ecologist, had been campaigning for his home country Australia, where the state of Victoria is planning to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill from 2019, to follow suit. He was accompanied to the clinic of the Swiss assisted dying organisation Life Circle by Dr Philip Nitschke, the founder of the Australian right-to-die group Exit International.“What I would like,” Goodall said, “is for other countries to follow Switzerland’s lead and make these facilities available to all clients, if they meet the requirements, and the requirements not just of age, but of mental capacity.”Though Goodall was not terminally ill, he had seen his eyesight and mobility deteriorate considerably in recent years and said that his life stopped being enjoyable “five or 10 years ago”.The scientist requested that his body be donated to medicine or, if that were no possible, that his ashes be scattered locally in Switzerland. He wished to have no funeral, remembrance service or ceremony, since he had “no belief in the afterlife”. Goodall flew from Perth, where his daughter, son and grandchildren also live, to France last week to see relatives before arriving at the clinic in Liestal, near Basel. His case caused controversy in Australia, with doctors in Perth at one point threatening to stop him flying to Switzerland.He spent his final full day exploring Basel University’s botanic gardens with three of his grandchildren, who said they were proud of his bravery in the face of great public attention and were glad he would die on his own terms.At his last press conference on Wednesday, Goodall was in good spirits and sang a few bars of Ode to Joy while wearing a jumper printed with the words “ageing disgracefully”.He said he would have preferred to die in Australia and previously voiced his resentment over the country’s laws. “Luckily my family who are in various parts of Europe and America have rallied round and come to see me, and I welcome the opportunity to see them, which I probably wouldn’t have had if I hadn’t pursued this Swiss option,” he told journalists.He appeared bemused by public interest in his case. “At my age, or less than my age, one wants to be free to choose the death when the death is at an appropriate time,” Goodall said.Exit International, which helped Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia’s “oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity”.“A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it,” it said on its website on Monday. “And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it.” However, the Australian Medical Association’s president, Dr Michael Gannon, says he was concerned that the “suicide of someone who’s aged 100” was being celebrated. “What is the age at which we no longer celebrate people continuing life?” he asked. “People like Dr Goodall make a decision based on nothing more than they’ve decided there’s nothing more to live for. I think that’s a dangerous line to cross.”“I have serious concerns about a community where we make arbitrary decisions about whose life is valuable enough to continue and whose should be ended under the law.”An honorary research associate at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Goodall produced dozens of research papers and continued to publish after his retirement. In 1979, he was editor-in-chief of the multi-volume Ecosystems of the World.He made international headlines in 2016 when he was declared unfit to be on campus. After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7255fb86e59e9abc21db47cdc477e4928517f61/0_5_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64753839f66b2c32396c1883136fb5df","title":"apple scraps 850m irish data centre after planning delays ireland","story":"Decision described as ‘hammer blow’ to west Ireland and comes before supreme court hearingApple is scrapping plans for an €850m (£743m) data centre in Ireland after three years of planning approval delays, the company has said.Plans for the European data centre were announced in February 2015, to be built in Athenry, County Galway, where green energy sources were available. The project was stalled by a series of planning appeals by conservationists seeking to preserve a forest.Last October, Ireland’s high court ruled that the data centre could proceed, dismissing the appellants, who took their case to the country’s supreme court.“Despite our best efforts, delays in the approval process have forced us to make other plans and we will not be able to move forward with the data centre,” Apple said in a statement before a supreme court hearing on Thursday.The world’s most valuable company announced plans for a data centre in Denmark at the same time as Athenry, which came online last year. Apple announced plans to build a second centre in Denmark in July. It said it still planned to expand its European headquarters in Co Cork.“There is no disputing that Apple’s decision is very disappointing, particularly for Athenry and the west of Ireland,” said Heather Humphreys, Ireland’s minister for business and enterprise. “These delays have, if nothing else, underlined our need to make the state’s planning and legal processes more efficient.”Paul Keane, the founder of the Facebook group Athenry for Apple, expressed anger after the decision was announced, saying it was “an absolute hammer blow to the locality and to rural Ireland”. The project would have been the biggest private investment in western Ireland and would have created about 300 construction jobs as well as 150 permanent jobs.One in every 10 jobs in the Irish economy is created by foreign multinational companies such as Apple. Significant investments such as data centres are viewed by Dublin as a means of securing multinationals’ presence in the country.The Irish government is in the process of amending planning laws to include data centres as strategic infrastructure, allowing such projects to get through the planning process much more quickly.Dublin said last month it had agreed a deal with Apple that would mean the US tech firm paying €13bn in back taxes. The repayment was ordered by the European commission, which said Apple had received favourable terms that amounted to state aid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/886a97fa248be6152f210cca23ffff4ef2e56a94/0_156_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd5dd8e826f8f94dda5f63f02fd66f9","title":"cristiano ronaldo tv producer facebook striker force 7","story":"The football superstar turns producer on a soccer-themed Facebook drama – and will play a cartoon sporty superhero in kids’ series Striker Force 7Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo is moving into the world of television by producing a show for on-demand service Facebook Watch and developing an animated project that has been compared to Michael Jordan’s Space Jam.The yet-to-be-named show for Facebook Watch will be executive-produced by Ronaldo and follows a female football team from upstate New York whose success, according to Deadline, will help “overcome deep isions along racial, ethnic and class lines”.“While the series is set against the background of soccer, it goes much deeper than just the beautiful game,” said Ronaldo. “It’s about values, challenges, friendship, difficult times, hard work, solidarity, tensions, and harmony.

So far, the provincial coroner’s office has identified eight of the 12. Of those eight, there were two pairs. The remaining lone feet, the coroner determined, belonged to men.Between 2012 and 2016, there was a four-year pause between sightings. Then on 7 February a new one washed ashore, discovered by a hiker along Vancouver Island’s Botanical Beach. Five days later, another one appeared. The coroner’s office confirmed they were a pair.After so many years, the arrival of human feet no longer provokes concern in the province. But when they first started to appear in 2007, speculation about where they came from ran rampant and pranksters even planted fake feet on the shores, just to add fuel to the fire.“We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock, who works at the coroner’s office, told the  in 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.”Since the first foot was discovered, theories about the feet have been numerous and creative. In 2008, a Toronto Star article said that “speculation ranges from natural disasters, such as the tsunami of 2004, to the work of drug dealers, serial killers and human traffickers”. In 2008, the man who found the fifth foot told the  he suspected foul play: “There’s someone doing this all right. Think about it, if they tied a chain around someone’s ankle and threw them overboard, the foot would just pop off. That could explain it. Maybe they got a lot of bodies stored up in a container and they got washed out. We don’t know. There’s a lot of stuff goes on over there,” he said.But McLintock said this was not the work of a serial killer or the result of alien abductions. The coroner’s office has ruled that all of the identified iniduals committed suicide or died accidentally, most likely due to storms near the coast.After several years and a dozen cases, McLintock said their work suggests the feet are separating from the bodies during decomposition. This occurs more quickly underwater than it would on land.“The forensic anthropologists can be really sure of that because they can tell looking at the ends of the bones whether they disarticulated naturally or whether there’s any sign that any mechanical force has been applied to them, whether there’s any trauma, whether there’s any tool marks on them,” she said. “And none of them have had anything like that. All the evidence is pointed to just this natural articulation process.”But some people still have questions – for example, why did the feet only start turning up after 2007? The answer may be advancing shoe technology. More and more sports shoes are using air pockets or light foam in their designs, which “eventually allows them to be light enough to float and to wash up on shore”.The coast of British Columbia sees many of these cases because of tide and current patterns, according to McLintock. And while the odd foot pops up elsewhere in the world – for example, several have come ashore in Washington state – British Columbia remains in the spotlight. But McLintock has no doubt that this occurs worldwide, and not just on her coast.“Presumably there probably are a bunch of running shoes bouncing around out there,” she said. “But no one’s ever going to find them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea623ffdbcd87430c8115fcc8150ebe29006e37b/0_233_1912_1146/master/1912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=857517c91c58b7ca717ad2b8a8e82556","title":"britain apologises for appalling treatment of abdel hakim belhaj","story":"Theresa May apologises unreservedly for UK role in rendition of Libyan, who was jailed and tortured, and his wifeTheresa May has apologised for the “appalling” treatment of a husband and wife who were the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of MI6.The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, read out a letter from the prime minister in which she apologised unreservedly to the Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, on behalf of the government.He also announced that Boudchar, who was pregnant when the couple were kidnapped, would receive compensation of £500,000 for the UK’s role in her treatment. Belhaj had neither sought, nor received, a financial settlement.Boudchar watched from the Commons public gallery as Wright told MPs that, after mediation, the government had reached a full and final settlement with the couple, who had withdrawn their legal claim.Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u0026nbspand his wife, Fatima Boudchar,\u0026nbspwere the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of\u0026nbspMI6.They have battled for compensation and an apology for more than six years, after papers that came to light during the Libyan revolution revealed the role that British intelligence officers played in their 2004 kidnap in Thailand.The couple were hooded and shackled and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death.They had sued the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspAmong the evidence obtained by Scotland Yard was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts.Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya,\u0026nbspTony Blair paid his first visit\u0026nbspto the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”.\u0026nbspOther documents discovered during the Libyan revolution\u0026nbspmake clear that information extracted from Belhaj was used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.May told the couple the UK should have done more to reduce the risk that they could be mistreated, accepting that it was a failing on the government’s part.She also said the UK had wrongly missed opportunities to help the couple once they were in custody in the prisons of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. The prime minister acknowledged that the unacceptable practices of the UK’s international allies should have been realised sooner, implying criticism of both the Libyan regime and the CIA’s practice of rendition.  “It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Boudchar who was pregnant at the time,” she said.“The UK government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way.“The UK government’s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. We should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated. We accept that this was a failing on our part.“We wrongly missed opportunities to alleviate your plight. This should not have happened.“On behalf of Her Majesty’s government I apologise unreservedly. We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal that you both suffered and our role in it. The UK government has learned many lessons from this period. We should have realised much sooner the unacceptable practices of some of our international allies, and we sincerely regret our failures.” The couple have battled for compensation and an apology for over six years after papers came to light during the Libyan revolution that revealed the role that British intelligence officers had played in their kidnapping.They were seized in Thailand in 2004 before being hooded and shackled and flown to one of Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death. He was released six years later. Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant when she was abducted. She was set free shortly before giving birth. Reacting to the apology, Belhaj told the : “The wording of the apology was heartfelt. There was a feeling of concern, an admission of the shortcomings, an expression of unreserved apology, lessons learned, admission of failings and an expression of disappointment towards the international partners that I was handed over to. “All of these sentiments that came through in the apology, I welcome them. This is in spite of my belief that the length of time is part of the suffering. That is because you feel that you suffered and endured and were wronged, and then you have to wait for years. But what matters is the result in the end.” Boudchar, who was in parliament with her son, said: “I thank the British government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the government’s apology.”Belhaj added: “What I saw from the responses of the MPs today, it was like a balm, and I felt that there were those who saw the need for laws and guarantees to prevent this from happening again. “From the very first moment, I insisted that there must be an apology. I never asked for monetary compensation because I don’t want to impose on the taxpayers, and so I can put a quick end to this suffering, but what led us to the courts is the rejection of the demand for an apology. I welcome this step, the acceptance of the apology condition, and I hope this is not repeated with someone else.” Wright told MPs: “As we have seen in recent years there remains a considerable international threat to the UK and our allies and it is important that government and the security and intelligence agencies are able to respond properly so we can keep our country safe.“But it is also important that we should act in line with our values and in accordance with the rule of law. That means that when we get things wrong it is right and just that we should acknowledge it, compensate those affected and learn lessons. I believe this is such a case.”The government’s most senior law officer set out some details of the out-of-court settlement, including Boudchar’s compensation and the couple’s decision to withdraw their legal claim. He said that no admission of liability had been made by any defendants, who include the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the government. “This has been a long-running and highly complex piece of litigation which has been extremely difficult for all the iniduals involved as parties,” he said. In a statement, Straw said: “I welcome the withdrawal of the proceedings against me that had been brought by Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar. I recognise that the events they describe will have been deeply distressing for them. “As foreign secretary I was responsible for approving or authorising a wide range of matters to protect our national security, including by meeting our international obligations to share information with international partners. “I took these responsibilities very seriously. As I have said on many occasions I sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.” Straw said he had limited recollection of the events, but had ascertained that on 1 March 2004 he gave oral approval for “some information to be shared with international partners”. “In every case where my approval was sought I assumed, and was entitled to assume, that the actions for which my approval was sought were lawful,” he said. “This included in appropriate cases obtaining assurances as to the humane treatment of those concerned. “This case clearly raises serious issues. However, I remain constrained for national security reasons as to what further I can say publicly.” Straw noted that he had already been interviewed by police investigating the case, and said that he was ready to provide a full account of his knowledge of the circumstances of Belhaj’s case to the parliamentary intelligence and security committee.Sapna Malik from the law firm Leigh Day, who represented Belhaj and Bouchar, said: “Today’s historic occasion is a tribute to the resilience of our clients in their quest for justice. “After six long years of litigation, HMG has rightly acknowledged that, even in the fields of counter-terrorism and international relations, there are lines which must not be crossed and which were crossed here, with devastating consequences for my clients.“Today’s candid apology from the government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal, and is warmly welcomed.”Cori Crider, the lawyer representing the Belhaj family on behalf of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said the extent of the government’s apology was unprecedented. “It’s broader and deeper and more sincere than any apology we have seen from the war on terror,” she said. “We are very gratified by it.”Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: “The government’s unreserved apology for the unimaginable suffering Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar have endured is welcome. Justice was delayed, but at least it hasn’t been denied. “David Cameron promised a full judge-led inquiry into our country’s involvement in torture and rendition in 2010, but it is still yet to materialise. Until torture survivors and the British public know the full extent of the UK’s failings, ministers cannot claim to have learned the lessons to prevent this ever happening again.”Belhaj had said in the past he would settle for just £3, £1 from each of the defendants, as long as he and his wife received an apology from the British government.The couple’s lawyers brought judicial review proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service after it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against Allen following a four-year investigation by Scotland Yard. Both Straw and Allen have always denied any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe2cf0a8c7a96543c36ab1e8c48568ab17449c23/0_273_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82d65d7dc9d47457d0acedd250e650e5","title":"five star league closer forming italian italy government","story":"Prime minister expected to be chosen from one of two populist parties after talks prove positiveThe Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League have edged closer towards forming a government in Italy in a move that would pave the way for a prime minister from one of the two populist parties.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, said in a joint statement that talks early on Thursday on defining a government programme and setting priorities had been positive.They said significant progress on the cabinet’s composition and who would lead it had also been made “in view of constructive collaboration between the parties with the aim of deciding everything as quickly as possible in order to give a response and a government to the country”.Giancarlo Giorgetti, a politician with the League for more than 20 years who has been mooted as a potential prime minister, was also at the meeting, as was Vincenzo Spadafora, a deputy with M5S.Although Salvini and Di Maio are not entirely out of the running, others mentioned in the Italian media as potential prime ministers include Enrico Giovannini, a former chief statistician at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Giulia Bongiorno, a lawyer who made a name for herself after her defence of Giulio Andreotti, a former prime minister found guilty in 2002 of complicity in a mafia-linked hit against a journalist.Bongiorno also defended Raffaele Sollecito, who alongside the American Amanda Knox was cleared in 2015 of murdering the British student Meredith Kercher.Salvini, who has mostly campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, could potentially take the role of interior minister with Di Maio as foreign minister. The role of integration minister, scrapped by Matteo Renzi’s government in 2014, may also be re-established and filled by Toni Iwobi, a League politician who became Italy’s first black senator when he was elected in March.A meeting between the two parties’ technical representatives will be held later on Thursday, the statement said.The latest development breaks the nine-week stalemate that prevailed after inconclusive national elections in March, but was only made possible after the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party had teamed up with the League as part of a centre-right coalition that won the largest share of the vote, agreed to step aside late on Wednesday. Berlusconi, 81, had been the stumbling block in earlier negotiations between the League and M5S, with the four-time ex-prime minister seen as a potent symbol of the corruption they have campaigned against.The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, on Wednesday gave the two parties a 24-hour deadline after they unexpectedly sought more time to clinch an agreement amid the threat of a caretaker government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3b846b29293f39e1840a9ad6a8f5d191b21f1f/0_179_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=771146b2ce9903bb1ee1c6f9909c763e","title":"malaysia election confusion as rival questions mahathirs right to be sworn in","story":"Defeated incumbent Najib Razak allegedly offering inducements for MPs to switch sidesMahathir Mohamad has been sworn in as Malaysian prime minister, despite efforts by the defeated incumbent Najib Razak to resist conceding and allegedly offering opposition candidates $6m to switch sides.Despite the opposition gaining a historic win in the election, gaining a simple majority for the first time in 61 years, hours of uncertainty followed the result, with questions over whether Mahathir, a former prime minister who this year switched to the opposition party, would be allowed to return to power. However, by late Thursday night, it was confirmed by the Palace that, after interviewing all leaders of the opposition parties, the King was finally willing to swear Mahathir into office. At 92, he becomes the oldest leader in the world.Mahathir’s confirmation had faced post-election setbacks, with reports that the king- who is notoriously anti-Mahathir- was refusing to swear him in and that Najib was attempting to swing the election his way by buying up candidates in the state of Sabah.There was also a suggestion that, according to the constitution, Mahathir was not even eligible to be prime minister because the opposition coalition is not technically one party.The party that got the most seats was PKR, which is led by Wan Azizah, the wife of former rival Anwar Ibrahim, and there were reports she would be named prime minister instead.However, speaking on Thursday morning Mahathir attempted to put all doubts to rest about whether he would be prime minister and said he would be forming a government by the evening.Dr Mahathir Mohamad was Malaysia\u0027s longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 1981 to 2003. He is credited with overseeing a period of economic growth but was also notoriously authoritarian, cracking down on the opposition, the judiciary and the press. Mahathir selected Abdullah Badawi as his successor, but toppled him in 2009 after a poor election performance and installed another protege, Najib Razak, as prime minister.Having officially retired, Mahathir then denounced Najib in 2015, after the 1MDB scandal broke. In 2018, it was announced he had switched to the opposition party, and, at 92 years old, would be running again as prime minister to bring down Najib. If his win is confirmed, he will be the oldest leader in the world.“Today I want to emphasise that our coalition, Pakatan Harapan, has already won a clear majority and therefore we are invited to form a government. We stand by the rule of law and whatever we do must be governed by the constitution.”He said that according to the constitution “the prime minister should have the support of the majority of the candidates of parliament, it does not say it should have the support of any one party”, and emphasised that all parties in the coalition had signed a letter backing him as the choice for prime minister.“We would like to form the government here, today, because currently there is no government of Malaysia,” said Mahathir. “We hope that at 5o’clock today we will have formed a government.”Multiple reports from the ground in the state of Sabah suggested that on Thursday morning Najib and Barisan Nasional were still offering the candidates from the local Warisan party 20 million ringgit ($6m) to switch sides, though that would still not give them a parliamentary majority.Mahathir, however, insisted that Warisan were fully backing the opposition coalition and dismissed the reports from Sabah.Najib, who had been prime minister since 2009, made a speech on Thursday morning saying he accepted “the verdict delivered by the people”. However he did not admit defeat and instead highlighted that no party had achieved a simple majority.“Because no party has gotten a simple majority, therefore the king will be making a decision as to who will be the prime minister,” said Najib.With Mahathir now in power, Najib may also be facing the prospect of being investigated and prosecuted for his role in the 1MDB scandal, where $3.2bn of a Malaysian government fund was embezzled, with $681m allegedly ending up in Najib’s personal bank account and funded a multi-million dollar jewellery spree for his wife. As prime minister Najib cleared himself of any wrongdoing, but Mahathir has repeatedly stated his belief that Najib was involved and pledged to see justice done.Speaking on Thursday, he did not rule out prosecuting Najib. “I am not seeing revenge, we don’t want to punish people but the rule rule of law will be clearly implemented,” he said. “If Najib has done something wrong, then he will have to pay the price.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"HSE chief Tony O\u0026rsquoBrien confirms he read 2016 cancer audit memoLast year is worst on record for public bodies failing to decide on requests on time \u0026ndash TyndallAlan Feehily jailed after court hears he threatened and blackmailed young victimCourt hears woman participated in sexual act \u0026lsquobecause it was her way of surviving\u0026rsquoCalls returned after check on records, data quality, and linking with health professionals \u0026ndash HSEPeople Before Profit TDs gather outside Leinster House with abortion pillsUse of these forms of cannabis is very restricted despite moves to permit limited useJanette Lakes claimed Fingal County Council failed to repair a leak in an upstairs toiletO\u0026rsquoBrien said he was informed audits had not thrown up concerns in relation to qualityThe 21-year-old GAA footballer was murdered while on a visit to Co Mayo last AugustRoad ersions were set up after collision on East Wall Road involving a truck and carThe 37-year-old mother of five was told in 2013 that her smear test was clear.

A spokeswoman said that the contact was “at most once or twice a week”.Several sources familiar with the internet companies said they believed that Google and Facebook had become alarmed in recent days at the prospect of the referendum being defeated and that they would be blamed by Yes campaigners and some elements of the media for their failure to adequately control or regulate advertising from the No side.Facebook and Google declined to comment on the suggestion. Opinion polls continue to show a strong lead for the Yes side, though that lead has slipped since the start of the campaign.Observers and campaigners have noticed a significant increase in ads from the No side in the past week, and No campaign sources have confirmed to The  that their plans included a substantial intensification of online advertising and campaigning in the final weeks of the campaign, culminating in a bid to target undecided voters in the final three days of the campaign.However, that strategy is now undermined by the Google and Facebook decisions. It is understood that the Save the Eighth campaign had booked €40,000 of ads with Google in recent days, which will now be cancelled.Google declined to supply any information about cancelled ads or the spending on ads in recent weeks.A statement from all three campaign groups for a No vote rejected Google’s explanation that the move was about “concerns about the integrity of elections”.“It is about concerns the No side will win. It is very clear that the Government, much of the establishment media and corporate Ireland have determined that anything that needs to secure a Yes vote must be done. Online was the only platform available to the No campaign to speak to voters directly. That platform is now being undermined, in order to prevent the public from hearing the message of one side,” the statement said.Together For Yes director Ailbhe Smyth said the Google move “creates a level playing field between all sides . . . who can now seek to convince the Irish electorate by the strength of their argument and power of personal testimony, not by the depth of their pockets.“We believe this referendum will be won on facts, and now when undecided voters are searching online, they’ll see the most relevant answers to their questions – not the ones that are paid to be put in front of them,” she said.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"US president promises \u0026lsquospecial moment for world peace\u0026rsquo when leaders meet on June 12thMahathir Mohamad\u0026rsquos return to power brings an end to ruling coalition\u0026rsquos six-decade reignSome of over 100 protesters in Almaty carried banners saying \u0026lsquoFreedom to political prisoners\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoStop torture\u0026rsquoUS secretary of state returning with \u0026lsquothree wonderful gentlemen\u0026rsquo, says TrumpPM Najib Razak\u0026rsquos party loses seats in key states, raising prospect he could be voted outDual citizens are blocked from national elected office under Australia\u0026rsquos 117-year-old constitutionMeeting signals China\u0026rsquos desire for influence ahead of planned Kim-Trump summitChongqing party boss Sun Zhengcai took millions in bribes, court saysAhsan Iqbal (59) is attacked by a gunman during an election rally in Punjab provincePresident says philosopher\u0026rsquos theory still holds true on 200th anniversaryWorkers have started to restore electricity as homes, crops extensively damaged herds killedLiu Xia despairs as talks to free her from house arrest appear to stallMany of the deceased hit by collapsing walls, trees in north and west of countryAnti-ship and surface-to-air systems set-up on reclaimed land in South China Sea, reports sayIndian court tells government to enlist overseas specialists to fix pollution damageReuters journalists working on investigation into killing of Rohingya men and boys were arrested in DecemberAustralian Cardinal is most senior Vatican official to be charged over sex abuse in Catholic ChurchCase brings fresh attention to abuse of power by mighty \u0027chaebol\u0027 conglomeratesCardinal is most senior Catholic official to be tried on such allegationsWang Yi travels to Pyongyang days after landmark summit with South Korea"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

decapitated mothers womb gynaecologist pulled","story":"Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 41, accused of the improper delivery of a babyA consultant gynaecologist caused a premature baby to be accidentally decapitated inside as she carried out a delivery on an NHS maternity unit, a medical tribunal heard.Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 41, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position but instead attempted to carry out the delivery using standard procedure, it was claimed.The hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester heard how the doctor urged the patient to push as the practitioner applied traction to the baby\u0027s legs.It caused the fatal injuries, it is claimed, and two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman before handing her the infant after performing surgery. The case relates to the incident which occurred on March 16, 2014, when Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.At the hearing, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman in an exchange across the room. She looked at the doctor and said: I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you as the gynaecologist stared at the floor.Hearing evidence of the incident, the tribunal heard how the mother\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated and it is claimed it had not been established whether or not the mother was in labour.Patient A, holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a C-section.Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside the tribunal hearingBut when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening.A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me.They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}I said to them \u0026#x27it doesn\u0026#x27t feel right, stop it, what\u0026#x27s going on, I don\u0026#x27t want to do it\u0026#x27, but nobody responded to me in any wayPatient AI tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic.I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there.Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.I just said, \u0027It\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you\u0027. She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.Midwife Mona Chard said: I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who.I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push.That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a standard delivery.Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix had clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damageLawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QCMr Garside added: At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section.New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of her baby.Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart.She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.Spotify removes R Kelly from all of its playlists under new hateful conduct policyMahathir Mohamad, 92, sworn in as world\u0026#39s oldest elected leader after shock win in Malaysia Georgina Chapman: I was terribly naive not to suspect my \u0026#39wonderful\u0026#39 husband Harvey WeinsteinFive key Isil leaders captured in sting after Iraqi agents lure them into trap using Telegram appFreed Americans tell of abuse, torture and hunger inside North Korea\u0026#39s prison campsDonald Trump to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore for North Korea summitRamadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranUS Mother\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the campaign was won – and the woman behind it turned against her life\u0026#39s workJealous husband used wall-mounted iPad in his \u0026#39smart home\u0026#39 to spy on estranged wife, court hears On this Day in 1849: Katsushika Hokusai – Japan\u0026#39s artistic master and painter of The Wave – diesVigilante \u0026#39paedophile hunters\u0026#39 are to be investigated by police after a gang of eight allegedly assaulted a paedophile at his girlfriend’s home‘Bi-sexual’ beetles don’t swing both ways...they’re just inept at mating, study showsRoyal wedding souvenirs: History of royal memorabilia (and where you can buy your own)New species of coral found near Bermuda 104-year-old Australian scientist dies after flying to Switzerland to end his lifeHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Vulnerable Afghan women left at risk by government proposals to take control of women\u0026#39s sheltersChina lands military plane at third Spratly Island, just 12 nautical miles from PhilippinesRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Italy edging towards coalition government after two months of paralysisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/14/19/oxbridge.jpg","title":"oxford cambridge universities oxbridge colleges access higher education policy institute","story":"\u0027Other institutions have expanded their undergraduate numbers far more than the two Oxbridge institutions have done\u0027Oxford and Cambridge should set up new colleges to boost the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds at the prestigious universities, a report suggests. The foundation of new Oxbridge colleges could open up the highly selective institutions to more students from underrepresented groups, the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) has said.Nick Hillman, director of HEPI, has put forward the idea in a paper of recommendations for the new universities regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), on how to widen access in the sector.Cambridge and Oxford among worst universities in UK for class equalityThe new report, from HEPI and charity Brightside, said only a small number of universities do the “heavy lifting” when it comes to increasing the number of disadvantaged students, while the “access gap remains stubbornly wide at many of the most selective institutions”.It comes after Cambridge and Oxford were named in the top five most unequal universities in Britain for admitting students from different economic backgrounds in HEPI’s rankings.In the paper, Mr Hillman wrote: “In recent decades, other institutions have expanded their undergraduate numbers far more than the two Oxbridge institutions have done. “If existing colleges are reluctant to increase their undergraduate entry, then it is time to consider founding a number of entirely new Oxbridge colleges to boost the number of students from underrepresented groups at our oldest, richest and most prestigious universities.”Last year, figures from Labour MP David Lammy revealed that 13 Oxford University colleges failed to make a single offer to black A-level applicants over a six-year period.And figures for Cambridge University revealed that for each of the six years, on average, a quarter of colleges failed to make any offers to black British applicants.Other proposals made to Chris Millward – the new director for fair access and participation at the OfS – in the paper include looking again at post-qualification admissions, granting more fee waivers for asylum seekers and delivering mandatory unconscious bias training for staff.“People from rich households are more likely to reach the most prestigious institutions, white working class boys rarely make it to higher education and there is a big black attainment gap. “Groups like disabled students, LGBT+ students and refugees all face barriers in meeting their potential. The time for woolly ideas is over,” Mr Hillman said. In response to the paper from key figures in the higher education sector, Mr Millward said: “I am pleased to see that many of the issues given priority are ones that I am already addressing in my guidance to universities and colleges. “For example, despite the progress made in access and participation for some groups, there are still wide gaps for mature students, for white males from the lowest income groups, and at the universities with the highest admissions requirements. “And when students do enter higher education, certain groups also face real barriers to succeeding during and after their studies, particularly black and Asian students and those with disabilities. “I have made it clear to universities and colleges that I expect them to address these issues in their access and participation plans, which the OfS must approve if they wish to charge higher tuition fees.”Student news in picturesStudent news in

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since 2013, ratings are based on just the one question: ‘Would you recommend your builder to a friend?’ In a statement, Bovis said it had made significant changes to its build quality and customer service, which had transformed the company. It added that it had a strict policy with regards to the HBF customer survey.Bovis Homes expects profits to rise ‘significantly’ this yearA spokesman said: “Currently more than 87 per cent of our customers across the country would recommend us to friends and family, representing a 30 percentage point improvement on where we were at the same time last year.“There are strict rules around the management of the HBF customer survey and we are absolutely committed to adhering to those.“In the current survey year, which started on 1 October 2017, we have so far received more than 740 surveys, and around 87 per cent of those returned would recommend us to family or friends.“If there is any evidence that any one of those hundreds of positive responses – or any from previous years – were not returned according to the rules, then we would wish to see that evidence and we would investigate it thoroughly.”In relation to the case in which £1,000 of a homebuyer’s bills had been paid, Bovis said it was investigating the claim that payment had been conditional on the customer completing her feedback form.A spokesman said: “On this point, we are currently investigating one claim made by a customer to The Independent, where it appears that our processes and procedures have not been followed and the colleague involved has been removed from site while we make further enquiries.”Charlotte and Michael Kenton say they had to have their toilet replaced after they found it broken (Charlotte Kenton)When new CEO Greg Fitzgerald took charge of Bovis – after the resignation of David Ritchie in January 2017 – he promised to ensure that the house builder was no longer “handing over crap or incomplete houses to customers”.Mr Fitzgerald, who made the statement after Bovis was found to have been paying homebuyers as much as £3,000 to move into unfinished homes in a failed attempt to reach an ambitious target of completing 4,131 houses by the end of the financial year, served six years as a company director for the National House Builders Council, the UK’s main home construction warranty provider, prior to his appointment.However, The Independent has been told by several homebuyers that problems with quality remain. Allison Briggs, 49, said that her hi-spec washing machine was broken on the day she moved into her property on a development in April 2017.When Bovis later replaced it, she claimed the whole house vibrated when was the washing machine was on.Bovis Homeowner Allison Briggs\u0027 says this video shows her property shaking due to the structural issues of her homeShe told The Independent: “I am living in a Bovis nightmare. I wish I could walk away.”Another, who bought their property in January 2017, said they had experienced problems immediately. But when they approached Bovis, the house builder allegedly told them the house being situated on a corner caused the issues. They told The Independent: “We raised the issue again with Bovis and yet again we were told every excuse possible.”In a statement, Bovis said: “We are committed to continuing to drive through these improvements in our business and to deal with any customer issues by our home warranty.In those rare instances where items might be disputed, then we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues, and we are committed to meeting all of our obligations in these instances.”“We apologise to any customer who did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are concerned that using isolated historic case studies as a reflection of our current performance misrepresents the business and will have a negative impact for those thousands of satisfied Bovis Homes customers who are not being contacted by the media for their experiences of buying a new-build home.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesThe coffin of former House of Commons speaker Lord Michael Martin, followed by his widow Mary, is carried from St Aloysius in Glasgow after his funeral.

Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the dealFive Labour MPs from the North East“Because this is so important, we believe the British people should have their say on the final Brexit deal.“Just as the people had their say in the referendum in 2016, we believe the final decision on this country’s destiny should lie with the British people in a people’s vote.”The MPs in particular highlight how firms like Nissan in Sunderland, Hitachi in County Durham and in the chemicals industry on Teesside, providing thousands of jobs, see their future within the EU customs union and single market – which both Conservative and Labour leaderships are committed to quitting.Keir Starmer: Brexit deal means UK will be tied to single market ‘in perpetuity’They also raise concerns over damage to the NHS and concessions that will have to be made to other countries to secure trade deals.They write: “There is so much at stake here. Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the deal.“This will hit living standards of families throughout the region.

It cannot be right for the majority opinion here to essentially go unheard.Theresa May: ‘We’re leaving the single market ... in certain ways access will be different to what it is now’“We don’t believe the issue of the Irish border, and the impossibility of avoiding a hard economic frontier without single market access, was sufficiently addressed during or since the campaign. The SDLP is urging Labour to use this opportunity to act in all of our interests by remaining in the EEA“It is important to note that customs union membership alone will not prevent such a border.”Underlining the point, she argues that a hard border “can’t be prevented by clever words in a treaty text or by imagined technological innovations”.Ms Hanna explains that she is writing on behalf of the entire SDLP to urge Labour MPs to back the EEA amendment, when it eventually comes to a vote in the Commons.Barnier: ‘the single market cannot be a la carte’“As a sister party of the Labour Party, the SDLP is urging Labour to use this opportunity to act in all of our interests by remaining in the EEA.”Turning to the threat to the Good Friday Agreement from a hard border, she says the amendment must be backed to protect the “hard won peace in Northern Ireland”.She wrote: “As a party committed to the principle of consent and campaigning for support for Irish unity, the SDLP understands the importance of the guarantees offered in the Agreement to all sides as a way of building confidence in the process of political change.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But Mr Mahathir said he had won a clear mandate to form a new government and brushed aside any doubts that he would be the one to take the country forward.There is an urgency here, we need to form the government now, today, Mr Mahathir told a news conference, where he insisted that he would be sworn in as prime minister later on Thursday.Malaysia opposition coalition leader Mahathir Mohamad: \u0027swearing in of Prime Minister will occur within a day\u0027An official from the opposition alliance, known as the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), said Mr Mahathir had been granted a meeting with the king at 5pm local time.Pakatan Harapan comfortably beat Mr Najib\u0027s Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition, and official results showed it took 113 seats - one more than the number required for a majority in the 222-member parliament.But doubts remained over Mr Mahathir\u0027s status, Malaysian media reported, as Pakatan Harapan was not formally registered as a coalition prior to the vote.Asked why he had not yet been sworn in on Thursday afternoon, Mr Mahathir said he got up late after the vote count went long into the night. Mr Mahathir led Malaysia for 22 years until 2003, but returned from political retirement to take charge of the opposition, with Mr Najib embroiled in a corruption scandal and facing growing unpopularity towards a controversial new sales tax.Looking downcast as he took to the stage to address the media alongside other senior National Front politicians, Mr Najib said: The National Front will respect whatever decision is made by the king.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesMissiles rise into the sky as Israeli missiles hit air defense position and other military bases, in Damascus, Syria.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humour, we don\u0027t think it is funny we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.Israel\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was not involved in approving the dishes for the meal.We respect and appreciate the chef.

This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe it is not a real shoe, Segev\u0027s publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.On Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is enquire about the guest.

Mosul: Volunteers reveal what they REALLY see                 Lonely: Just two hours a week volunteering could help solve crisisHe said: \u0026ldquoMany people will think this idea is one step too far for the public to volunteer for, whereas others may be willing to keep their village clean and tidy.\u0026ldquoI am sure opinions will be split.The council explained that a recent survey of 152 parish and town councils found that 53 per cent already undertook minor highways work, including cutting grass, spreading grit, clearing snow and cleaning road signs.In the survey, 34 per cent of respondents said they would be interested in doing minor work, while 66 per cent said either they would not be interested, or they are not right now but may be in the future.A Suffolk Highways spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are currently looking into potential ways that Suffolk\u0027s town and parish councils could support us in delivering minor remedial works in their community.\u0026ldquoWe understand from many councils that they are keen to do more.\u0026ldquoHowever, our priority concern is the safety of anyone who may be involved in this activity.In 2014, Suffolk Police were criticised for encouraging officers to use their own vehicles for police business as it worked out cheaper than renting vehicles or organising pool cars."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Frankfurt-957876.jpg","title":"brexit news uk eu london germany frankfurt finance market","story":"Reports in Germany suggest bankers are snubbing FrankfurtAfter the EU exit vote Frankfurt-based banks appealed to Britain\u0027s bankers to make the move to Germany\u0026rsquos finance industry two years ago, after the Brexit announcement sparks concerns over London\u0026rsquos number one position in European banking.Brexodus was a term Remainer\u0026rsquos seized on with regards to reports UK\u0027s banks were looking to leave the capital.However, London\u0027s markets continue to thrive, leaving Frankfurt\u0027s efforts in vain as Germany struggles to pool in UK talent to its main capital.Frankfurt\u0027s international appeal stands below London, as the UK economy continues to remain viable and productive - despite Britain leaving the EU.

But if we don’t get access, we will find an alternative.”The Commission wrote to ministers in January saying Britain would not be able to stay in the Galileo satellite system for data security reasons.But that letter is being kept under lock and key in the Secretariat General, which is now run by all-powerful German official Martin Selmayr who has taken a hard line on Brexit.And it is understood that chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team were left out of the process as the Commission insisted Britain will be cut adrift after we’ve left.The revelations came after diplomats from the 27 Member States gathered last Thursday to discuss the latest Brexit developments.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “The UK has sent a letter to the Commission outlining its wishes and the Commission has reacted to that not from Barnier’s end but from the Secretariat-Gerneral’s.“That [Commission] letter has never been seen by the Member States.”A second EU diplomat confirmed: “We’d like to get a copy of the letter that was sent to the UK.”A Commission source said the meeting had focussed on the security-related aspects of shutting the UK out of Galileo, a move which could cost British businesses hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson has reacted furiously to the Commission’s snub and ministers are now mulling building our own rival satellite.But one EU diplomat added: “I think in the end the two parties will reach an agreement so that the UK can still participate in it.“The UK is leaving and that has consequences — you can’t expect everything to just keep on going on the same footing. But this is a negotiation and it’s still ongoing.”The £8.8 billion Galileo satellite is a rival to America’s GPS system and plays an especially important role in military operations. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran is getting the direct assistance from the North Koreans.“The Iran regime shares its own experience and expertise with North Korea”The report alleges that Iran pays the impoverished hermit kingdom in oil in exchange for its nuclear expertise.Despite the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Trump has withdrawn the US from, Iran has continued to develop nuclear-capable missiles, claims Jafarzadeh.He added: “These missiles are not being developed for defensive purposes.“One of the main goals is the missile programme is to develop nuclear-capable missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads with a range of over 2000km.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404857746.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"israel air raid sirens syria golan heights strike damascus","story":"Fighter jets bombarded military bases, munitions warehouses and intelligence centres, after Tel Aviv stoked fears of a war by warning: If it rains in Israel it will pour in Iran.The strikes hit nearly every target and were in response to 20 rockets fired by the Iranian Quds Force, Israeli military chiefs claimed.Five Syrian soldiers, including two officers, and 18 militia fighters were killed in the attack, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The death toll is likely to rise because some of the wounded are in critical condition, a spokesman for the group explained.The Observatory believes the strikes targeted suspected locations of the Lebanese Hezbollah group, as well as areas where Iranian advisers are believed to be based.What we know so farThe conflict came hours after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuke deal with Iran.Tel Aviv said the missiles at the Jewish states defensive line, near southern Syria, were fired by Iran - who in turn were responding to strikes on Damascus.Israels Iron Dome defence system intercepted some of the rockets and no one was injured, Israel military confirmed.Israels minister of defence Avigdor Lieberman said: I want to warn of arrogance. There was no sweeping victory tonight. This is not the Battle of Stalingrad.It was a limited confrontation and should be confined to it and not expanded.Theresa May has condemned the Iranian strikes and called on Vladimir  Putin to convince his Syrian president ally Bashar al-Assad to stop plans for further attacks.A spokesman for the PM said: Israel has every right to defend itself.We call on Iran to refrain from any further attacks and for calm on all sides. We call on Russia to use its influence in Syria to prevent further Iranian attacks.Meanwhile angry demonstrators in the Iranian capital of Tehran burned American flags as they protested against Trumps landmark nuke move.Yesterday, ministers burned US paper flags in the Middle Eastern nations parliament as shouted death to America.Shortly before the suspected strikes on the Golan Heights, an annexed area occupied by the Israelis since 1967, Syria claimed that Israel had attacked targets in the Quneitra province south of Damascus.Syrias state media said air defences had intercepted hostile Israeli missiles, fired over the south west of the capital city, early on Thursday morning.It later claimed Israeli missiles had destroyed a radar on the northern border.The bombardment comes after missiles strikes on Tuesday were attributed to Israel following reports of “irregular activity” of Iranian forces in Syria.Campaigners said the strikes killed at least 15 people and targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.The Israel Air Defence Command (IDF) had deployed the Iron Dome defence systems and opened bomb shelters in Golan Heights and in northern Israel in preparation for retaliatory strikes.Tuesdays attacks represent an immediate escalation in tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump walked away from the 2015 nuclear agreement Barack Obama struck with Iran.Known officially as the JCPOA, the so-called Iran deal was designed to curb Iranian nuclear ambitions while in return easing the sanctions crippling its economy.Israel, which almost never confirms or denies airstrikes in Syria, did not comment on Tuesdays attack.Last month, an IDF strike on Syrias T4 air base in Homs province killed seven Iranian military personnel.On April 30, Israel was said to have struck government outposts in northern Syria, killing more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians.Israel did not confirm most of the airstrikes although for months it has repeatedly said it will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.In February, the Jewish state, which is a major ally of the US in the troubled region, shot down what it said was an armed Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace.Israel responded by attacking anti-aircraft positions in Syria, but an Israeli warplane was shot down during the battle.Iranian forces moved into Syria after the outbreak of the civil war in 2011 to back the forces of President Bashar Assad.As that war winds down, and Assad appears to be headed toward victory, Israel fears that Iran, along with tens of thousands of Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen, will carry out attacks against it.Following Americas withdrawal from the Iran deal, Saudi Arabias Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said his country would develop nuclear weapons if Iran restarted its nuclear programme."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004046315661.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"from the argentinian tycoon to the adult film star six secret lovers of prince harrys bride meghan markle revealed","story":"And pals of the royal bride-to-be recall how she took her search for Mr Right very seriously, swearing by a love bible called The Rules.Aimed at women who want “marriage in the shortest time possible”, the self-help guide tells girls to be “easy to be with but hard to get” in order to win The One.Meghan, 36, who will wed Prince Harry on May 19, studied the self-help guide so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.Today The Sun can reveal for the first time the identities of six men she dated who, according to a source, Meghan measured up as husband material.A source recalled: “Meghan used to quote The Rules all the time and really put it into practise with a number of her boyfriends.“She was never without a boyfriend for more than two or three months and always striving to have someone by her side.“She liked the idea of being part of a team and having a domestic life. Any relationship that she was in, there was always an element of marriage in the back of her mind.“Meghan would very quickly go into thinking, ‘What would this relationship look like in ten years?’”The book’s 35 rules include “No More than Casual Kissing on the First Date”, “Don’t Rush into Sex”, and “Don’t Talk to a Man First (and Don’t Ask Him to Dance).”Written by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, the guide was an instant sensation when it was first published in 1995.It was also controversial because its rules rejected many feminist ideas. But the source says the techniques Meghan learned from the book were instrumental in her wooing first husband, film producer Trevor Engelson, now 41.The pair began dating in 2004, became engaged in 2010 and married in September 2011. They split two years later.The source said: “She put all The Rules into play with Trevor. He had the bravado, the charisma and the looks.”He also — apparently — had the finger of fate on his side.A source told The Sun that a fortune teller in Argentina once informed a young Meghan that she would wed a man with “curly red hair”.The aspiring actress was given the reading by a clairvoyant in Buenos Aires in 2003 while she working as an intern for the local US embassy.The source said: “She took the prediction quite seriously and when her first husband Trevor Engelson came along, she believed it was a reference to his curly hair.“She thought he must be The One.”Here The Sun reveals six other romances in Meghan’s life before she met her true Prince Charming.WHILE working as an intern at the US embassy in Buenos Aires in 2002, 20-year-old Meghan caught the eye of a passionate and wealthy Argentinian tycoon.One evening, the smitten businessman sent his car to pick up the uni student and take her for a date.A well-placed source told The Sun: “It was something of a liberation for her.“She was off in Argentina, away from everybody and she had this little adventure on the quiet.“He was a successful businessman and it was a case of, ‘I will send a car for you, be ready’.She was really taken by that.”The source said Meghan found the occasion “exciting” but added: “It was very unlike her.”Meghan was in her final year at university at the time, studying international relations and theatre.She took a break to spend “a few months” working at the embassy, where she says she became convinced she would “for sure have a career in politics”.MEGHAN had a single date in 2004 with Scary Movie actor Simon Rex – who long before meeting her had made several porn films.Former model Simon, now 43, even claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997.He is now also a comedian and rapper, using the rap name Dirt Nasty, and proudly reclines naked on a bearskin rug with his dog Duane in the banner photo on his Twitter home page.Simon also posts crude jokes, recently posing in a Coca-Cola costume with the caption: “I think I have a Coke problem.”Friends say Meghan and Simon had their one-off date in Los Angeles after meeting on the set of short-lived US sitcom Cuts when they both guest-starred in the same episode.He later landed a leading part as George Logan the Scary Movie franchise, and also had a small role in Baywatch. In a 2014 interview he admitted to doing porn as a young man to pay his bills.He said: “I went there and did that s***. It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment. In hindsight it wasn’t the best move.”There is no suggestion that Meghan ever knew about his porn past.ACTOR and screenwriter Shaun Zaken had a six-month romance with Meghan in 2003.The pair had both attended Chicago’s Northwestern University and both had ambitions to make it in Hollywood, Meghan’s home town.Shaun, now 38, who later played a waiter in an episode of Sex And The City, would practise his audition lines with her.But when he did not want the commitment she craved, they split up.A source said: “His family are well-off with a home in the Hamptons (a posh resort in New York state) and he had good connections in Hollywood. She liked that lifestyle and his access.“But they were both quite demanding and there were passionate public rows.“She really pursued him because she saw a future with him, but he wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment.“She was broken hearted by their split.”Shaun is now a comedy writer and wrote a show last year about a fairytale Prince Charming landing in modern-day Los Angeles.AFTER splitting up from Shaun Zaken in 2003, Meghan dated another actor and writer, Brett Ryland, for five months.Brett – who has appeared in a handful of obscure US television dramas – for five months.One pal said: “Brett adored Meghan. He was constantly trying to shower her with love and she enjoyed the attention, but she seemed to be in it more for the affirmation.“He didn’t have the kind of bravado or high profile she was looking for in a partner. He tried hard but there wasn’t much glamour or huge chemistry.“One day the switch just flipped, like it did with (first husband) Trevor, and she called it off. But he is a good guy, so they stayed friends.”Brett, who lives in Los Angeles, later became a writer for hit show Two Broke Girls before becoming a content media manager for a social media firm.DURING Meghan’s first year at university in Chicago, she fell for strapping college basketball star Steve Lepore.She would gush to pals about her “tall, dark, handsome all-American” boyfriend.A source told The Sun: “She was moving into a new world from LA and being able to land a guy who was already settled and popular was important for her.“She was very proud of having landed this handsome guy and happy to share photos of him. She spoke of how broad and beautiful his chest was.“Meghan was used to being ‘the star’ of the pairing but Steve was the star of the basketball team. She hadn’t ever dated someone like that.”But after five months in 1999, Steve transferred from Northwestern University to a college in North Carolina.Steve, 38, now lives with wife Carrie, 33, and their baby daughter in Virginia, and is a basketball coach at a military academy.After striking out with Steve, Meghan began a stormy nine-month romance with a wealthy fellow student at Northwestern. They had a tumultuous relationship.The source said: “She was very much in love with him, but it was a tempestuous relationship.“It was highs and lows. She was ecstatic when things were good and then she would be in a really dark place.“She was taken by his status as his family were wealthy diplomats, but when she went to Argentina she cut ties and it taught her some lessons about who she should be with.”Top biographer Andrew Morton, Sun Royal photographer Arthur Edwards and Royal Correspondent Emily Andrews will be discussing Meghan and Harry’s wedding -- and sharing their best stories.The chat will be broadcast live on talkRADIO.Free drink and nibbles.To get a ticket go to:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it delivered a withering verdict on the preparation for setting up new trade defence measures by Trade Secretary Liam Fox, finding the resources given to the TRA were wholly inadequate.MPs also said the delay of the Trade Bill until the autumn - revealed by The Sun last week - means the vital trade watchdog would have no legal basis until just weeks before our EU departure at best.Experts told MPs they were sceptical the Government would be able to recruit and train staff to carry out the work needed by next March.But the committee said a fully functioning TRA is critical for a robust regime that protects against unfair moves such as subsidies and dumping.The report said: Trade defence investigations are inherently complex, involving resource-intensive, information gathering exercises and massive calculations.Collecting and analysing the required data necessitates a large staff, with economic, legal, competition, financial analysis and language expertise.Witnesses were sceptical about whether the Government could resource and train staff to perform these investigations in less than 12 months.The committee also raised concerns about the Governments proposals for how the TRA would be appointed.MPs were told that the International Trade Secretary has a significant role in the selection process and that could lead to the body becoming ideologically stacked.They warned it is easy to underestimate how contentious trade defence may be and said the TRA board should be robustly independent.Whoever is chosen to chair the organisation should have to go before the committee for approval, it recommended.Committee chairman Angus MacNeil said: Developing an independent trade policy is an inherently complex exercise, whatever the circumstances.The need to establish new trading relationships must be balanced against the requirement for a robust trade defence regime, capable of protecting domestic industries against unfair trading practices.Establishing a world-class, independent trade remedies authority (TRA) should be high on the Governments trade to-do list. However, the task has been made even more complex by the Department for International Trades familiar foe: time.With March 2019 fast approaching, we have identified serious concerns about whether the TRA can be established, appropriately resourced, and fully operational by the Governments self-imposed deadline.A Department for International Trade spokesman said: Setting up a new Trade Remedies Authority is essential to our preparation for the UK’s future independent trade policy.“We are glad that the International Trade Committee recognises the Government’s commitment to protecting UK domestic industries from unfair trading practices. We will respond to this report in due course.“We have engaged with the International Trade Committee, including on the structure and senior leadership of the TRA.

They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

My neighbour was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house.He was blind so he could not run. They found his body in the morning... My other neighbours also died. All our houses have been ruined.Nakuru is home to thousands of commercial farms which grow everything from French beans and macadamia nuts to flowers - most of which are exported to Europe.The region is dotted with irrigation reservoirs, built in the last 20 years, to meet the demands of the rapidly expanding agricultural sector.Vinoj Kumar, general manager of the Solai farm, blamed the disaster on massive rainfall in the forest above the dam.He said: In the past two days the intensity of the rain was high and the water started coming down carrying boulders and roots which damaged the wall.Local police chief Japheth Kioko said the death toll could well climb. So far it is 47 dead. We are still on the ground, he told Reuters.The death toll from the catastrophe is expected to rise, according to the Daily Nation which suggests high volumes of water were to blame.It is feared dozens of people including children and the elderly are still trapped in the thick mud.The Kenyan Red Cross and local disaster management teams rescued around 40 locals from the rubble overnight.They abandoned the mission at around 2am last night when it got too dark, before resuming this morning.Police chief Gideon Kibunja said almost an entire village was demolished by the fast-flowing silt and water.Officials said the dam water and mud spewed out of the reservoir and submerged homes over a radius of just over a mile.Water also flooded the 8,000-acre Nyakinyua farm which belongs to the same owner of the dam, reports claim.The wall of water which burst through Patel Dam caused huge destructionWe will do our best to take affected families to safety and help them get medical attention, said Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui.Mr Kinyanjui added: The water has caused huge destruction of both life and property... The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained.Kenya, like other countries in East Africa, has experienced heavy rain over the past two months.The disaster raises the already high death toll in Kenya from floods due to high seasonal rain.On Wednesday, the government said rains had killed 132 people and made 222,456 homeless since March.Military helicopters and personnel have for the past week been deployed to rescue people marooned by the flooding.Floods hit as the country was recovering from a severe drought which affected half of the country.More to follow...For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-life stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

A fog descends, confusion reigns, even my own handwriting is a mystery, the words written by a stranger who slipped away while I slept.It all started in 2012: I was 56, healthy, a non-smoker, and I worked as an NHS manager at St James’s Hospital in Leeds.But there was an impending sense of something I couldn’t put my finger on. It had lingered for a few months. Everything was getting slower. On bad days, my mind couldn’t instantly recall names and faces and places like it used to. It just wasn’t me.September 2012I’m the one my colleagues nickname the guru because my recall is so sharp, because I can problem-solve in a second, remembering who works night shifts, who needs which day off.I’d brought up my two daughters - Gemma and Sarah alone since their dad left when they were four and seven. It was hard, but there was always a way that was my motto.But the snowdrift that seems to have settled in my mind remains, along with a lack of energy and the same feeling I can’t put my finger on.One day I’m out running, and I fall flat onto the pavement. There are another three falls in quick succession.Later, I am sitting in a hospital waiting room.The sensation of a head half-filled with cotton wool has continued for months and this weekend had been much worse.When I got to work on Monday, my colleague noticed how my words were slurred, and now I’m here.In the end, doctors blame a hole in the heart for causing a stroke.March 2013 I’m back at work after the stroke.The things I do forget – names or numbers, places, people – well, that’s understandable. It’s because I’ve been off for months, or at least that’s what everyone says, and I start to believe it myself. Almost.But two months later, I’m sitting in front of a consultant neurologist, trying to pinpoint the vagueness I’ve been feeling.What sense would it make to her if I told her about that thick pile of yellow Post-it notes scattered on the carpet by my bed had got thicker and thicker, as I woke numerous times desperate to remember all I’ll need to get through a day in the office.My mind just doesn’t feel … sharp, is all I can offer, and the consultant nods and writes down some notes.A month on, I’m seeing a clinical psychologist called Jo.Is there anything I should do to help myself in the times when my mind feels particularly … foggy? I ask.There may be times when you become disorientated, the fog will descend and your surroundings will be unfamiliar,” she says. But the most important thing to remember is not to panic, give the fog time to pass, let the world become clear again. And it will.That’s all. She’ll see me again in 12 months.I’m sitting opposite Sarah while she holds a letter in her hand from Jo.It is possible that this is a profile of the early stages of a dementing process, it reads.A few weeks later, another letter, this time from the neurologist. To be certain [of this representing an early dementia] we would need to demonstrate deteriorating cognition in six to 12 months’ time. If no change I would diagnose mild cognitive impairment, he writes.Sarah and Gemma are with me as I read this. The three of us sit quietly.I look at my two little girls, that’s nothing to do with my memory, just the lens a mother always views her children through, the urge to protect them never dims.September 2013Six months later, I’m in a meeting at work.I glance around the table at the familiar faces, and yet I can’t recall their names.  Tiny seeds of worry whittle away inside as I shuffle my paperwork, confused about where to start.I look up. We expect to start rolling out the system in two months’ time … I pause, every eye upon me, but the word I need next is lost -  there’s a blank in my mind where it should be.Silence hangs in the room, and for a fraction of a second I’m sure they’re wondering if I’m fit for this job. I feel stupid then. Stupid, frustrated, confused, humiliated.An hour later, the meeting finishes, people file from the room, and then it come to me. The word I was trying to remember was and.I wake and sit on the edge of my bed, looking down at my feet. Where once there was pale green carpet, I’m now crunching yellow Post-it notes between my toes.The pile has grown thicker after another restless night of waking, turning, remembering something else I’ll need for the next day. I need to move, but I can’t think what I do first. Dress? Eat? Shower?I’ve become a master of disguise, but there are days when I can’t camouflage the confusion. I dread the knock on my office door, the blank I know will be written across my face.A sister on the ward who phones me and I don’t know who she is. I buy time, ask her to come to my office. When she does, I realise we’re friends.I thought I’d done something to offend you! she’d said. And I laugh it off, blaming a busy day.June 2014I’m sitting in front of Jo again.She starts going through the same memory tests as before. But when she asks me to name objects beginning with a certain letter, nothing comes. She asks me to draw a clock, I don’t know where to start.It’s obvious to both of us that there’s been a decline, fear is gathering in the pit of my stomach.Over the next two weeks, I do more memory tests. They don’t go well. What do you think it could be? I ask finally.She looks into my eyes, and her voice is calm and steady. Possibly dementia, but I can’t be completely sure, not until we get the results of all the tests.Of course, I reply. But a numbness embraces me, and a sadness too, a feeling that this is the end because that’s all I know about dementia - the blank stares, the helplessness, the confusion.In bed later, I lie awake, unable to push dark thoughts from my mind. Is it really dementia? Might the doctors be wrong?July 31, 2014I’m sitting in the cramped office of the neurologist as she shuffles through her paperwork.As she starts to speak, I notice the pity in her eyes.It’s early-onset Alzheimer’s.Nothing prepares you for the feeling of emptiness.It’s not so much a fear of death that hits me, but a sense of time running out.That’s what dementia steals, the future you imagined all laid out in front of you, with no idea when something more final might come.Good luck, says the neurologist as I leave her office. I won’t see her again, because there’s no follow-up after diagnosis.September 2014I’ve been relying on the Post-It notes I write to myself, reminding me to take my pills, book a dental appointment. But they’re starting to fail me now.What good is a note to yourself if you forget to look for it?I pull the calendar down from the wall and start to fill my iPad with doctor’s appointments, friends’ visits, a daily reminder to take my tablets and to put the rubbish bins out.I hesitate over October 17th, Sarah’s birthday, just a few weeks away.Surely I’d never forget a date as important as that - but just in case, I set a reminder for the evening of her birthday. Anyway, I always ring her in the morning.October 17, 2014I go to work, then come home and start making myself something to eat. I’m humming along to the radio when I hear a ping.Puzzled, I open up the iPad. And when I see the reminder, my insides turn icy-cold. It can’t be. There must be a mistake.I check the date on the calendar, abandon my meal and reach for the phone. I’m shaking as I dial Sarah’s number.I’m so sorry, I say. I-I don’t know how it happened.It’s OK, she says. You just forgot.Nothing can ease the sadness, the mortification: I’ve forgotten my own daughter’s birthday for the first time in 34 years.My logical mind knows that it’s the disease, not me, but on a day like today it’s hard to tell us apart.February 2015Six months after the diagnosis. I tell my managers, my heart beating so hard I wonder if it can be seen through my shirt.A month later, I’m having a meeting with the occupational health consultant. I’m still managing my team efficiently— I begin.But she’s already filling in a section headed: Incapable of meeting the demands of her NHS employment.My fate has been decided.It’s Sunday, and I’m ironing at home in front of the TV.I’ve discovered upsides to dementia. I can watch The Great British Bake Off again and again.When I get to the series finale, the winner is always a surprise to me, and then I go right back to the first episode and get to know the contestants all over again.A progressive illness can focus the mind in a very special way, and I’ve resolved to find out all there is to know about this dreadful disease.I vow that I’m going to remain independent for as long as I possibly can.There’s always a way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Abdel Hakim Belhaj, 52, and his wife Fatima Boudchar claimed they were returned to the brutal regime in 2004 through a joint M16-CIA operation following Tony Blair\u0027s infamous deal in the desert with the Libyan dictator. Attorney General Jeremy Wright admitted Britain\u0027s role in the rendition today, announcing \u0026pound500,000 would be paid in compensation to Mrs Boudchar. But Mr Belhaj always made clear that he was not seeking monetary compensation and will not receive any. The Prime Minister has written to them both to apologise. Mr Wright said the Government had reached a full and final settlement with the pair, who had taken the government, Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6 and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to court. Mr Wright said that Prime Minister Theresa May has written to Mr Belhaj and his wife to apologise for their appalling treatment. But as part of the settlement, neither Sir Mark nor Mr Straw admitted liability. Mr Wright explained the outcome of the settlement to the Commons. He said: First: No admissions of liability have been made by any of the defendants in settling these claims. Secondly: The claimants have now withdrawn their claims against all the defendants. Thirdly: The government has agreed to pay Mrs Bouchard \u0026pound500,000. Mr Belhaj did not seek and has not been given any compensation. Finally: I have met Mr Belhaj and Mrs Bouchard, indeed Mrs Bouchard is present in the gallery to hear this statement. And the Prime Minister has now written to them both to apologise. In her apology, the Prime Minister accepted the British government had a role in their detention and Mr Belhaj\u0027s torture .   Government expected to apologise to Libyan man kidnapped and tortured after \u0027British tip-off\u0027  She wrote: Your accounts were moving and what happened to you is deeply troubling. It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Bouchard who was pregnant at the time. The UK Government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way. The UK Government\u0027s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. The UK Government shared information about you with its international partners. We should have done more to reduce the risk that you would be mistreated. We accept that this was a failing on our part. Later, during your detention in Libya, we sought information about and from you. We wrongly missed opportunities to alleviate your plight. This should not have happened. On behalf of Her Majesty\u0027s Government, I apologise unreservedly. Ms Boudchar, who was five months pregnant when she and her husband were returned to Libya, was in Parliament when Mr Wright made the apology.

And he made a very good fist of it.  Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject.  Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. Corbyn’s questions were uncharacteristically sharp and direct. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy? was his opening gambit.  Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill?  The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?

That\u0027s when the 16-year-old schoolgirl was last seen taking a taxi in the pouring rain to the top of Box Hill, a bleak but stunning area of woodland in Surrey. There, she was dropped off in a lay-by by its driver, who later told how he watched her stood still in the rain as he drove away. That was nearly 23 years ago - and Ruth hasn\u0027t been seen or heard from since. Despite heartbreaking pleas from her loved ones and fresh appeals in the area every few years, her disappearance remains unsolved. But now, a documentary claims to have unearthed new clues in the case - including a dark family secret that \u0027consumed\u0027 the teen.  The short film was produced by journalist Martin Bright and retired politan Police detective Liam McAuley, who lives in Surrey. It claims that Ruth had been unaware of the truth about her mum Nesta Wilson\u0027s death, which happened when she was a toddler. Some claim the teenager had grown up believing Nesta died after accidentally falling down the stairs and breaking her neck. But just weeks before her disappearance on November 27, 1995, she reportedly went to London to examine her mum\u0027s death certificate. The certificate showed the tragic truth - Nesta had killed herself. It is claimed that Ruth had been unaware of the true circumstances surrounding her mother\u0027s death until shortly before she vanished.  It is also alleged that Surrey Police knew she had become aware of this at the time of their initial investigation, Get Surrey . However, there was no reference to it in public appeals. The schoolgirl became consumed by this revelation and \u0027fixated\u0027 on trying to find out what happened, her childhood friend says. Appearing in the documentary, Catherine, who still wears a ring Ruth once bought her, describes the teenager as really troubled. She goes on to tell Mr Bright: She told me how her mum had died. She knew her mum had fallen down the stairs, but something obviously didn\u0027t add up for her so she pursued it and looked for the truth.. and found it. Bit of a shocker, eh?  The film features Nesta\u0027s death certificate, showing the mum hanged herself just weeks before Christmas, in December 1982. She told me that she found out her real mum had committed suicide, continues Catherine. She adds in the documentary that the teenager was definitely working up to some kind of boiling point. On the day she vanished, Ruth didn\u0027t get the bus to school. Instead, the student, who lived near Dorking, ordered a taxi and went to the town\u0027s library, where she spent several hours. She then went to a florist\u0027 and ordered a bouquet of flowers, arranging for them to be delivered to her stepmum two days later. There was no card attached to them.  The teenager was then seen taking a taxi from Dorking railway station before being dropped off near a pub at Box Hill in the rain. That was at about 4.30pm - and she has been missing since. Police launched a massive search to try to locate her - including a police helicopter and police dogs - but she was never found. When I came across it [the case] I found myself being drawn into the mystery. Something didn’t add up, Mr McAuley says. Ruth, from Betchworth, was a pupil at Ashcombe School. The 30-minute film, named \u0027Vanished: The Surrey Schoolgirl\u0027, works from the standpoint that she is no longer alive. It is claimed that it shatters the background narrative of her disappearance. Surrey Police and the Wilson family have not contributed to the documentary, but many of Ruth\u0027s school friends and her ex-boyfriend have come forward.  Some of the teenager\u0027s pals claim she had discussed running away. The documentary suggests there is potentially more information available in the case, which has not yet been explored. Mr McAuley believes a sinister explanation may be behind the disappearance of Ruth, who would today be 39. He points out she had no documents or baggage with her. I will tell you what my theory is - there is somebody from the community responsible for that wee girl going missing, he says. Mr Bright, an investigative journalist, adds in the documentary: It looks to me that she met someone and something happened. However, one of Ruth\u0027s school friends says she ran away from home a month before she vanished and hinted at going away again a week or so before her disappearance, the Daily Mail reports. He believes she is not dead, but safe and well somewhere.  The documentary went live on YouTube\u0027s Real Stories last month. Commissioning editor Adam Gee said: The purpose of the film is to show that there\u0027s further to go with the investigation and that there are people out there with facts and testimonies that haven\u0027t yet been taken into account and our hope is that the film will help free up the log jam. Following the film\u0027s premiere and discussion at Dorking Halls on Thursday, April 26, Mr Gee said more people had come forward to share information about Ruth\u0027s disappearance. Mr Bright, who covered the story at the time for The Observer, talked about what he wanted to gain from having made the film. He said: I think she\u0027s probably dead. I would like a fuller response and explanation from the police on why they withheld the suicide of Ruth\u0027s mother throughout all the public appeals and ultimately see them start a renewed investigation into the circumstances of Ruth\u0027s disappearance. Surrey Police said it would not be appropriate to reveal what they were aware of at the time of their initial investigation.

After he died in June 2017 his family tried to sell it. “We had a cash buyer for \u0026pound90,000 but due to all the faults that were found the home was not fit for sale,” said his daughter Ann Early. “There are numerous cracks appearing in the outside walls so water has got into the insulation, if you push the walls hard your hand goes straight through.”  She took up the issue with Berkeley Parks, the site owners, and the manufacturers Stately-Albion Limited. “The home was bought new from Berkeley Parks so should never have deteriorated like this so that by the time my father died 15 months later it was unsaleable,” she says.  “They say to do the repairs they need a week with no rain, which is going to be hard to get in Cornwall.”  Stately-Albion carried out one visit to make temporary repairs but now Ann says they are ignoring her emails. Ironically, its website boasts: “You can put your concerns to one side with the knowledge that your new home will be safe in our hands.” The home even came with a “Gold Shield” warranty, which Stately-Albion claims “provides your home with protection for 10 years against any major inherent defects”.

While the prince was apparently keen for this aunt to be there, Prince Charles has snubbed her from the evening reception at Frogmore House , which he is paying for.

When the royals came downstairs the next day to their breakfast and morning papers, they were greeted with this unexpected sight. Royal commentator, Dickie Arbiter, recently told viewers of the ITV programme The Royal Wives of Windsor Okay you don\u0027t expect somebody to crawl through the bushes to take photographs of you topless while your financial advisor is sucking your toes. You don’t expect that but by the same token you don’t go away with somebody that isn\u0027t your husband and sunbathe topless. Needless to say, the Firm were not best pleased...  2. Weight-watchers Fast-forward to 1996, and Fergie and Andrew are officially divorced. But there were still stormy waters ahead. Enterprising Fergie signed deals with both Wedgwood china and Weight Watchers, with the latter proving to be especially controversial.  While Fergie\u0027s partnership with Weight Watchers proved to be lucrative (according to the Mail Online it paid her \u0026pound2 million a year) and lasted for 11 years, the idea of royal appearing in adverts was pretty much unheard of.   Fergie, however, was pretty open about it, telling USA Today, I\u0027d just been divorced and I needed to earn a living. I still do. Then there were some comments the mum-of-two made in 1997 about her youngest daughter, Beatrice. I mean, she is only 8, but she definitely can pack it on a bit, Fergie told The Independent, adding, Poor baby. I think overeating sort of runs in the family. These comments prompted Weight Watchers to issue a rather brusque rebuttal, saying: Weight Watchers UK does not believe that children should ever be encouraged to diet.  3. The fault in her stars The nineties definitely had their suboptimal moments for the Duchess of York. Shortly before her observations about her young daughter\u0027s weight were made publi came more controversy for Fergie. In December 1996 Fergie’s former astrologist Madame Vasso published Fergie: The Very Private Life of the Duchess of York.

They\u0027re caught between a warring web of building, recruitment and payroll firms blaming each other for the mess. This sort of disgrace is all too common in the casual labour market.  It\u0027s a case that echoes my story last week about freelance joiners who were only paid a fraction of what they\u0027d been promised .  This latest group found work on a solar panel farm in Leicestershire through TRH Electrical, Mechanical \u0026amp Building Services Contractors. Its director 29-year-old Dean Jacobs of Halesowen, West Midlands, blames the client for not paying the wages.  “The customer they were working for, Solgen Commercial, owed us just under \u0026pound200,000,” Mr Jacobs claimed. “We kept paying the wages for weeks without payment from the client, so we said to the guys, we have to lay you off, if you choose to go back that\u0027s up to you, we are not liable. “They went back anyway and because the customer has not paid them they\u0027re chasing me.” One of those out of pocket is site manager Simon Farthing. “It\u0027s a load of twaddle what Dean Jacobs is saying,” he responded. “He did not tell anyone not to go on the site, and was paid in full. I\u0027m owed \u0026pound2,667, it\u0027s put me in a right tight spot. “I had to cancel a holiday with the family to Minorca, and my mum and dad had to bail me out to help with some bills.” Another victim is electrician\u0027s mate Plamen Hristov.  We were promised \u0026pound21 an hour but got just \u0026pound8.75 - welcome to the world of casual labour  “I\u0027m owed \u0026pound1,000, it\u0027s two weeks money,” he said. “I did try to speak to Dean Jacobs lots of times but he puts the phone down.”  Plant operator Ron Hinson is owed more than \u0026pound2,000 and said: “I spoke to the project manager and he said all the wages were paid to Dean Jacobs, he\u0027s led us up the garden path.” Solgen Commercial is furious at Mr Jacobs\u0027 allegation that it withheld wages and described working with him as “a nightmare”. “We got half way through and I would loved to have dumped him but we had to keep the guys working through him,” said director Sarah Yeo. “He sold the invoices to Pulse Cashflow Services, so we owed Pulse, not him. “We paid Pulse Cashflow and I assure you we paid everything we owed in full. “There were a couple of invoices we didn\u0027t pay, probably only totally a couple of thousand pounds, but that was because he did not provide timesheets for them. We paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for three projects over several weeks.” Pulse Cashflow refused to comment, citing the Data Protection Act. But it added: “If you were familiar with invoice finance you would understand that the company remains responsible for its own staff and creditors, as it receives a substantial advance payment against the debts which are assigned to any factor. How the business spends this money is entirely at their discretion.”  There\u0027s yet another company involved – Sarah Yeo admitted it was “a bit confusing”, which is sadly typical of agency working. This company is Mayfair Payroll Services, which told Plamen Hristov in an email that it was still waiting for funds from Mr Jacobs. I phoned but was told that it had stopped trading. Whoever answered my call would not give the details of whatever business is now using the same number: “We\u0027re not obliged to say.”   This mess reminds me of another case I highlighted earlier this year, that of pipe-fitter Russ Blakely who was employed through a series of “umbrella” and payroll companies.  He won an employment tribunal after being denied basic rights such as holiday pay, in a case taken up by Unite, Britain\u0027s biggest union.

Simone Grainger and husband Steven discussed his drug use in a series of texts and WhatsApp messages to each other that were read out in court. Simone would leave the written messages as well as record voice messages, in which children can be heard playing in the background, to her husband including that marrying him was the worst mistake of her life. The messages centred around his drug use leading up to when her body was found in the first home they shared. Grainger, 32, is accused of hitting her over the head with a saucepan before strangling her and rolling her in blankets and leaving her in the conservatory of the house. Simone\u0027s cousin found her body when she visited the house because she was concerned she had not heard from her.  Grainger denies murdering his wife on November 4 last year and sat the dock at Reading Crown Court listening intently as 1,500 messages were read through by barristers. The court previously heard Simone had told a friend before her death how her sex life was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster, the hit ITV psychological drama.  Francis Fitzgibbon QC, prosecuting, said Simone had confided in two friends that she and Grainger had sex two days before her death.  He said: She said it was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster. Despite Mrs Grainger\u0027s anger and frustration they maintained a degree of intimacy. Mr Fitzgibbon also outlined messages Grainger sent after he is accused of killing the mother of his two children, in which it was said he contacted a prostitute for sex.  A mixture of WhatsApp, text and iMessage\u0027s from early in 2017 to the morning of the death were read to the jury by the prosecution about Grainger\u0027s drug habits. Simone sent one message to Grainger saying: I don\u0027t wanna be with someone who makes me miserable. The next month, Simone again messaged the defendant with: You constantly defend yourself, you are weird at night and can\u0027t sleep. You\u0027re always making mistakes. Grainger replied: I\u0027m sick of going on like this, everyday you make me out to be a c**t. In June, Simone messaged her husband and said: You\u0027re a druggy and a liar, to which Grainger replied: I\u0027ll spend the rest of my married life making it up to you.  Simone later responded by saying I wish I hadn\u0027t married you. Then in a spate of late night messages in July, Simone said I seriously can\u0027t stand you, druggy is your middle name, coke head c**t, s**t dad, you\u0027re lucky the kids have got my dad, coke heads ain\u0027t family men, and p**s off and die. The next day as the arguing continued, Simone sent in a message: The coke stopped your brain, you made me want to stab you.  Grainger replied: I\u0027ve been a p***k and will make it up to you, I\u0027ll never leave without you knowing again. Simone responded: You\u0027re constantly doing it, druggy c**t. Call me a d**k again and I\u0027ll stab you, you\u0027re selfish c**k.  Into September, two months before the death of Simone, messages were sent both ways. Simone said: Go to work you sad p***k, go and live on your mum\u0027s sofa where you\u0027re destined to end up. FYI you\u0027re an a***hole, a druggy and a drunk. Grainger said: You think it\u0027s normal, that you want to stab me? In another series of messages, the mum of two said: We are over, stop taking me for a p***k. You\u0027re a f*****g b*****d and I hope you get what\u0027s coming for you, die. The jury then heard the messages between the couple after Grainger failed to turn up to the family Centre Parcs holiday after he had bought five bags of cocaine for the trip but had gone on a binge the night before. Grainger sent to a friend: I had five bags to take to Centre Parcs and ended up like Henry Hoover.

As a nation we just all really love Prince Harry . We’ve been rooting for him, hard, since we saw that image that haunts us – which I don’t even need to expand on, because everyone immediately knows what I mean – back in 1997.  That’s over 20 years of rooting. So we’re pretty much definitely, unreservedly, on board with anyone who makes him as happy as he currently is.  Obviously it doesn’t hurt that Ms Markle’s ’mazing in her own right, too though. It’s the buttercream icing on top of the lemon and elderflower wedding cake she’s chosen, which is just the kind of perfect detail that makes us like her even more.  The funny thing is that Harry’s so delighted with her, we’d have loved and accepted Meghan wholeheartedly whatever she was like. It’s almost a waste for her to be as good as she is.  Let’s put aside the obvious (ethnicity, marital status, etc) because it’s a breath of stale air to describe her as a breath of fresh air, and yet impossible not to. There’s something extra about Meghan that seems different. Maybe it’s because she’s from another country, so hasn’t grown up being fully familiar with how stiff and formal the royals are... or maybe she knows all too well, and has decided it’s time for a change. The Royal Family are famously standoffish, but Meghan’s a hugger. When we see her with the public, sometimes it can seem a bit much, but that’s just because of how conditioned we are, what we’ve become used to over the years. Everywhere she goes at the moment, she’s meeting people who are genuinely thrilled for her, swept up in her love story and fervently wishing her the best – it’s actually extremely appropriate to be charmed by that. Meghan’s not being over the top, she’s behaving like a normal human being with feelings rather than a stuffy robot.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 41, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the infant boy was in a breech position. But instead the doctor attempted to carry out the delivery naturally, it was claimed. Tragedy struck when Dr Laxman urged the patient to push while herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs, the hearing was told. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s head to become detached and remain in his mother\u0027s womb while the rest of the body was removed. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was re-attached to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye. It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Dr Laxman and, in a harrowing exchange across the room, looked at her and said I don\u0027t forgive you, I don\u0027t forgive you as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf. The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16, 2014 whilst Dr Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated. In heartbreaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section. But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen. There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out. \u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a C-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain. The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.  I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way. Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point. I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you\u0027. She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury. I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.  Midwife Mona Chard said: I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked. The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C-section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed. The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council, Charles Garside QC, said: They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head. However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix. The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body. The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way. As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.

Safaa Boular, 18, planned an ambush using grenades or guns, and was told by her partner all she would need was a car and a knife, jurors were told. But she was thwarted after being remanded in custody in April last year for trying to reach Syria in 2016, it was said. Instead, she encouraged her sister Rizlaine Boular, 21, to carry out a knife attack in Westminster in order to “carry the torch forward”, the Old Bailey heard. Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, said: “Although her plans, and the focus of her practical energies evolved over a period of time, her resolve to engage in violence in support of the cause of ISIS, first in Syria and then, when thwarted in that regard, in the United Kingdom remained unswerving.  “Even after she was arrested, that resolve remained, as is all too clearly demonstrated by her encouragement of a similar resolve on the part of her elder sister, Rizlaine Boular.” She allegedly planned to travel to Syria to support and marry Naweed Hussain, an IS fighter in Raqqa. They had never met face to face but had spoken via social media, and by August 2016 had been speaking for two to three months, it was said. The prosecutor said: “They had declared their love for each other and resolved to marry and to have children together.” Jurors heard she planned by August 2016 to go to Syria, not just to meet Hussain but to join IS and “offer her services, together with her life”. They allegedly planned for her to support him in Syria. Mr Atkinson said: “This support, as they planned it, would extend to each of them donning a suicide belt.  “Their plan, then, was that together they would, as Mr Hussain put it, depart the world holding hands, and taking others with them in an act of terrorism. “This was not just empty chat. “Safaa Boular told the police when they interviewed her in 2016 that the idea of undertaking a suicide mission appealed to her, a view more than borne out by materials then stored on her media devices.” She acquired much of the material before she started speaking to Hussain, and had been in contact with others in Syria earlier, it was said. In August 2016 she prepared to depart for Syria with her sister Rizlaine, who had tried to go there herself “with a similar end in view” two years before, the court heard. Rizlaine had been sent money by Hussain to finance their trip, her travel plans were made and her departure was “imminent”, it was said. After Safaa’s alleged plan was uncovered she was interviewed by the police in August, October and November 2016. But “undeterred”, she remained in contact with Hussain using a new secret phone and the encrypted app Telegram, it was said. By the end of 2016, Security Services had deployed a “specially trained role player” to speak to Hussain to discover his plans.  Similar “role players” spoke to Boular, particularly after Hussain was killed on April 4 2017. Both believed they were talking to people “who shared their warped aims and objectives, rather than persons dedicated to thwarting their murderous plans”, the prosecutor said. Mr Atkinson said: “It was clear that Hussain had been planning an act of terrorism with Safaa Boular, in which she could engage if she remained in this country. “Both Hussain and Safaa Boular talked of a planned ambush involving grenades and or firearms.” Boular allegedly told the role player, believing them to be an IS fighter, that Hussain said all she would need would be a “car and a knife to get what I want to achieve”. Mr Atkinson said: “Based on her preparation and discussion, it appears she planned to launch an attack against members of the public, selected largely at random, in the environs of that cultural jewel and most popular of tourist attractions, the British Museum, in central London. “This would have been an attack that would at the very least have caused widespread panic, but was intended to involve the infliction of serious injury and death.” While Hussain had “undoubtedly done much to encourage” her, the intention underlying those plans was always her own, the prosecutor said. He added: “She was encouraged, but she was willing. She was supported, but she was resolute.” Her determination was strengthened after learning Hussain had been killed, the court heard. The prosecutor said: “With positive encouragement from her mother and her sister, Rizlaine, Safaa Boular wanted to be reunited with her fianc\u0026eacute in paradise by becoming a martyr.” On April 12 2017 she was charged over her plan to travel to Syria and was no longer at liberty “to put her chilling intentions into practice herself”, the court was told.

I love you to bits”: Karen Matthews reunites with former neighbour who helped jail herEXCLUSIVE: Former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, came face to face with Matthews during a Bank Holiday reunion this week\u0026nbspShareByLucy Thornton22:12, 9 MAY 2018Updated07:52, 10 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen Karen Matthews came face to face with the woman who helped police put her behind bars, it was bound to be an emotional encounter. And former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, did get a punch during their Bank Holiday reunion this week – a playful one on her arm as the pair bantered. Matthews, 43, told her: “I don’t hate you. You weren’t lying, just saying it as it was. In fact, I love you to bits.” Julie helped to get Matthews to confess to her part in daughter Shannon’s 2008 disappearance. She was in a police car with her, officer Christine Freeman and her pal Natalie Brown when the shamed mum admitted what she knew. Julie, a former chairman of the \u0026shyresidents association where the pair lived in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks, then gave evidence against her at her trial – and the judge praised her for her honesty.  As Matthews, who served four years of an eight-year jail sentence, met her in a park at the weekend, she said: “She’s been my friend from day one and she’s the only one who didn’t betray me when others did. I don’t hate her at all for it. “She just did what Julie does, she was straight and honest.” Reviled Matthews spoke to the Mirror this week in a bid to prove to the nation that she is not evil.  She even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to Shannon, who was found tied to a bed at accomplice Michael Donovan’s flat after a month-long search. Yet Matthews still denies her part in the sickening kidnap plot to cash in on the \u0026pound50,000 reward money. And pointing to other vile criminals, the mum-of-seven claims she was made a “scapegoat”, saying: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse I do.” Matthews did not recognise Julie until she said in her broad Yorkshire accent: “Hello, stranger.” Meeting at a secret location in the southern town she now lives in, Matthews told Julie: “It’s weird seeing you, it’s strange. But I’ve missed you.” The pair hugged before Julie, in her typical no-nonsense manner, challenged Matthews over fresh allegations about her having a 72-year-old sugar daddy and ripping off homeless people – which she denies. Julie teased: “So what’s this about you sh*gging an old man? You like them older, Karen, don’t ya! D’ya remember when you went out with [names a man], he was in his 60s or 70s.”  “I don’t remember him,” Matthews said, looking outraged. “But none of it’s true, Julie. He’s just a friend from work and I’m just so lonely and he was somebody to talk to. He’s nice to me.” She grimaced and pretended to be sick when asked if she had slept with him, saying: “I’m not interested in men at all. And I wouldn’t con homeless people. I’ve got a good heart really.” Leaving the park, the pair browsed charity shops together and popped into Poundstretcher. As they took a pleasure boat trip, Matthews waved to Bank Holiday sunbathers on the river bank while discussing her trial and catching up with gossip from her former home. Matthews told how she had never been on a boat before and Julie joked: “It’s all right, it might be your first and last time. I might throw you overboard!” Julie had to apologise frequently for forgetting to call Matthews by her new name, with the disgraced mum \u0026shyrepeatedly saying: “I don’t know her.” Matthews talked about her hobbies and told Julie how she enjoyed playing a colour by numbers game on her phone.  Julie laughed and said: “Anybody can colour in f***ing boxes, you want to try the real cross stitch. It’s very therapeutic.” As they passed luxurious back gardens along the river, Matthews said: “I wouldn’t like to live there, you’d have to fence it all off to keep the kids safe.” Julie, who was portrayed by Sheridan Smith in The Moorside, asked if Matthews had watched the hit BBC drama. “I did see bits of it but I didn’t like how they played me,” she said. She then added with a giggle: “But I thought that woman played you real good, Julie.” However, her smile vanished when the chat became more serious. Matthews told of her regrets at having missed her brother’s funeral because she was in jail, and her dad’s last year. And of mum June, who lives alone in West Yorkshire, she said: “She was a good mum, she did her best but we’re not in touch.” As the talk returned to her trial over Shannon’s kidnap, she said: “When they said ‘guilty’ to me in court, I was confused because I’d pleaded ‘not guilty!’. I hated sitting next to him [co-defendant Michael Donovan] in court. And then I got the same sentence as him and he’d drugged her. How can that happen?” Asked if she misses Dewsbury, she said: “I wouldn’t go back to Dewsbury, there’s nothing for me there... only Julie.” Julie laughed and said: “That’s all right, ’cos Dewsbury wouldn’t have you back anyway!” Mum-of-three Julie, who has seven grandchildren, is still living on the \u0026shyMoorside estate. She and Matthews were not best friends before Shannon vanished but knew each other and were at the same parenting classes. When Shannon went missing, Julie was one of the first people to offer help – organising the search, handing out posters and gathering people for candlelit vigils.

In an eerie video, the eyewitness describes what he saw as a huge all-black figure which walking along a hedgerow .  It has become almost an accepted phenomenon right across North America, the Bristol Post reports.  But the eye-witness said he was on a train from Exeter to Bristol Temple Meads, which was approaching the city on a bright Friday morning in November last year, when he saw the massive creature.  The report was made to the British Bigfoot Sightings group – a team of researchers based around the country who collect and investigate sightings of upright hairy ape-like creatures in this country.   The passenger reported that he left Exeter late in the morning, and there were few people on the train as it approached Bristol. “In my carriage was probably ten to 12 people - most of them with their head in either mobile phones or morning newspapers,” he told researchers. “I haven’t been on a train for years so I was keen to take in the scenery. “About ten miles from Bristol we were travelling through an area and in the fields to my right I saw something large in the middle of the field walking, it was walking kind of hunched over, and all I could tell you was it was a black figure. “At a guess I would’ve said it was 70 to 100 metres away from the train. My eyes were glued on it at this point.  “I was watching the way the ‘thing’ was walking, almost towards the side of the field, it was edged right up to the hedgerow as if to walk alongside the hedge itself, almost like it was using the hedge for cover? “To my eye whatever it was seemed to take massive strides, and ‘it’ was covering the ground very quickly. “As I spun my head to the left to see if anybody else on the train had seen what I was looking at, I was surprised to see that nobody was really looking out from the seats in my direction, or any direction other than down to be fair,” he added. If the eye-witness\u0027s judgement that the sighting took place around ten miles before the train arrived at Temple Meads is accurate, it would put the sighting to the south of the railway line between Nailsea and Yatton stations. The countryside in this point is low-lying wetland, between the M5 and the wooded hillside escarpment that runs up to Bristol Airport. “I would imagine five to ten seconds was all I saw it for,” the eyewitness added.  “But it stood out to me as strange. To start off with, I didn’t think it was a Bigfoot or anything like that, until I watched how it walked and the way it hugged the hedgerow. “I thought it was just somebody walking through a field, and if they were not acting in such a strange manner, with a strange gait, and hugging the bushes to stay hidden, surely a person wouldn’t do that? Or would look like that? “Then, about two minutes later, after viewing this figure I saw a couple walking a collie dog in a field, roughly the same distance that I’d seen the black figure. “They were to the side of the hedge line. I was gobsmacked to see that I could hardly make them out, I mean, I knew they were humans walking with the dog but I couldn’t really see what they were wearing apart from the brightly coloured coats. “And it dawned on me that they were probably of average size male and female, although what I had seen five minutes earlier was clearly not. It was an all-black figure in a field, ‘it’ was huge. “I could see the black figured arms and legs and chest, compared to the two humans I had just seen walking the dog. “At the point of seeing the black figure I realise the tree line behind it was probably around 200m away and had a thick dense forest behind it. I have no proof whatsoever to show you, only my word. “I’m 100 per cent sure what I saw was the English Bigfoot - and what makes me so confident is the way it walked, with slightly bent legs, long strides but a graceful fluid walking motion,” he added.  While sightings of a hairy creature which walks on two legs are an almost daily occurrence somewhere in North America – and the subject of TV series, books and films – even seasoned Bigfoot experts have questioned whether the animal could exist in the British Isles. But sightings continue to be reported to British Bigfoot researchers, from the dense woods of Suffolk to the remote mountains of Scotland. There have always been folklore tales of a hairy man-like creature living in forests of England - back in the Middle Ages they were known as \u0027woodwose\u0027. One leading British Bigfoot researcher Deborah Hatswell said it was possible a Bigfoot-like creature could still exist in Britain. “In 2012, the Government produced the National Eco-System Assessment, and it showed that only between six and eight per cent of the land in Britain is actually built on – the rest is either forest, farmland or wild mountains or downs,” she said.

Or, you could try to recreate the McDonald\u0027s goodness in your own home .  While this may sound laborious, one woman has shown that it\u0027s completely possible - and the results can be just as delicious. Home-made Chicken McNuggets with that sweet and sour sauce.   Perth-based high school teacher, Bernadette, shared her wisdom on the Facebook group Homemade McDonald\u0027s.  So successful were nuggets, that she\u0027s since got rave reviews. Last night I challenged myself to create what some in this group had attempted but never seemed to nail - the iconic 6 pack o\u0027 nuggs and sweet and sour dipping sauce, she wrote. Here\u0027s how she did it.  For the nuggets, she triple-coated a chicken breast in a zip lock bag of flour with salt, vegeta (stock powder), garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper with an intermittent egg wash. Next - and this could be the secret - she put them in a freezer between the second and third coats to ensure crispiness a la OG. As for the sweet and sour sauce, this was the part Bernadette felt a little nervous about, adding: I really didn\u0027t think this was gonna be possible to replicate at home but I came pretty damn close.  To create this, she put apricot jam, garlic powder, onion powder, soy sauce, mustard, white wine vinegar, glucose syrup and cornstarch in a food mixer and blitzed them. She then reduced them over a gentle simmer. As for the results, Bernadette awarded herself 9/10. Apparently she would have scored higher, but apparently the nuggets had too much flavour.

The devastated woman, only known as Suzie, said she sold her home and lost her dad\u0027s inheritance as internet lovers took advantage of her quest to find love. The Australian grandmother admitted she had been \u0027gullible\u0027 and even \u0027brainwashed\u0027 in the past but has now realised that men aren\u0027t all they\u0027re cracked up to be.

She told the programme: Maybe that\u0027s what I was doing: buying love. When I think back now I think that\u0027s what I was doing. Suzie says she was first scammed when she struck up an online relationship with a man she named \u0027David Fisher\u0027, who claimed to be British. She said he managed to talk his way into accessing her bank account in order to buy a laptop that he wanted to buy. But Suzie later found that her dad\u0027s $76,000AUD (\u0026pound42,000) had been stolen.  Then Suzie began talking to who she believed was an American soldier \u0027Johnson Williams\u0027, who told her he was fighting against the Taliban. She said she eventually sold her house as a result of constant requests for her to send money. But as her suspicions began to grow, Suzie eventually found out that her money was being wired to Ghana and that other women had been duped by the conman.

Deanne Carson, who describes herself on Twitter as a \u0027sexuality educator, speaker and author,\u0027 made the claim while speaking on ABC in footage above. She said she works with children from three years old on issues surrounding consent, but added that parents are advised to introduce ideas much earlier. Deanne recognised that babies are unable to give an answer, but said it\u0027s important to use eye contact to teach them their response matters.

The appalling story made headlines around the globe after the children\u0027s parents were arrested. But what happened to the family since January? Parents Louise and David Turpin are now facing 42 charges including torture, false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly shackling their children to a bed in California. The pair are accused of subjecting their brood to frequent beatings and even strangulation over the decades they were kept locked up in filthy conditions. The children had so little contact with the outside world, one reportedly didn\u0027t know what a police officer was.  When officers discovered their filthy living conditions at their home in Perris, in January this year, they were horrified. David Turpin 57, and Louise Turpin, 49, began tying the children up as a punishment many years ago, according to prosecutors. It allegedly began with one of the boys being tied to the bed with rope, but when he escaped they started using padlocks and chains to control their children. What happened to the Turpin children?  Police discovered the Turpin children living in horrifying conditions, with three children chained to a bed in Perris, California. The horrifying scenes were uncovered in January when one of the 13 children, aged 17, escaped before making a desperate bid to inform someone of the siblings left locked up. Seven of the Turpin\u0027s 12 remaining children in captivity were adults, with all their ages ranging from two to 29. The conditions in the filthy four-bedroom Perris home were said to be dark and foul smelling and the children and young adults were malnourished and dirty after years of captivity. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said: All 13 of the victims and defendants would typically sleep all day and be up through the night.  Starting many years ago, the victims would be tied up as punishment. These punishments would last for weeks or even months at a time. Police arrested both parents who are facing a total of 42 charges with a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 20. Several of the children were said to have cognitive impairment and nerve damage from extreme and prolonged physical abuse. Attorney Mike Hestrin added: None of victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. What happened to the children after their rescue?  Following their rescue, the children were taken to a police station where they were given food and drinks after they told officers they were starving. They were then taken to different hospitals for treatment and to be given to chance to wash. Police said the parents “were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. After recovering in hospital, CNN reported the children are now happy living in three separate homes in Riverside County. Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.  The adults spent time in recovery at the Corona Regional Medical Centre hospital for two months. The centre\u0027s CEO Mark Uffer spoke about the moment they left hospital, saying There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children, he said. They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon., reports CNN . All seven adults are now living in a home together. Two of the youngest children were put into foster care, while the remaining four are at another home after authorities struggled to find accommodation for all six together. The children are reportedly regularly in touch via Skype. How were the children discovered?  The children were discovered when a 17-year-old girl plotted her escape alongside others help in captivity. Early one Sunday morning, she climbed out of a window with a one of the younger children, before the younger child became frightened and turned back. The teenager managed to alert police by that 12 of her siblings remained in captivity. She used a deactivated mobile phone to call 911. Police at the time mistook her for a child aged around 10 due to her severe malnourishment.

They put me on dialysis and told me surgery would be around 8am.“I was taken off dialysis at 11pm and went back to my bed. My parents were staying in accommodation provided by the hospital.“I couldn’t sleep until about 5am because I was so nervous and excited.“The surgeon visited me an hour before the operation and told me the kidney wasn’t a perfect match but it was still pretty good.“He asked me formally if I wanted to go ahead.

hearing last year that she had shared a hotel room and bought or gave alcohol to the youth, who was 17 at the time.The psychologist, from Perth, had been working at St Mary’s Kenmure, a secure residential unit for vulnerable youngsters in Glasgow, at the time.She struck up a relationship with the teen, named only as Service User A, who had been living at the unit, after being both his psychologist and “pathway supporter” during her time there.She then drove with him to Preston, Lancashire, for a Frankie Boyle comedy gig and a two-night hotel stay in March 2016.They both drank in the shared room at the Marriot Hotel in the city but their antics led to police being called to the room by hotel staff.The teen was then detained — despite Dr Fearn’s pleas for officers to reconsider as he was judged to be a “suicide risk” in confined places.Police in attendance observed that Dr Fearn appeared to be under the influence or smelling of alcohol in the presence of her vulnerable young charge.She only informed care bosses about the incident the next day, while driving back to Scotland.There was no suggestion of an “intimate” relationship between the pair but the Health and Care Professions Tribunal Service (HCPTS) said there was “no doubt that there was a total blurring of boundaries”.At her tribunal hearing last year, Dr Fearn avoided being expelled from her profession.Instead, the HCPTS gave her a 12-month conditions of practice order, requiring Dr Fearn, who has since left her job at St Mary’s Kenmure, to tell the Health and Care Professions Council if she got a new position.For the last year, she has also been required to work only with service users over the age of 18 and to disclose her restrictions to potential new employers.The review hearing is set to take place in Glasgow on May 22.Dr Fearn was unavailable for comment at the time of going to

However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"}]
