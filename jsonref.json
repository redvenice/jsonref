His ministerial salary will double from £34,367 to £71,673.Mr Spencer is also embroiled in an investigation over disputed claims that he told MP Nusrat Ghani she lost her ministerial role because her Muslim faith made people feel uncomfortable.In another endorsement of loyalists, Paymaster-General Michael Ellis, who has repeatedly defended the PM over Partygate, was handed a seat at Cabinet.The reshuffle was male-dominated, with some critics dubbing it a \u0027he-shuffle\u0027. But the PM later gave two female MPs new roles.Whip Heather Wheeler was made a junior minister in the Cabinet Office, albeit with no extra pay, and transport minister Wendy Morton gained seniority. Mr Johnson also doubled his unpaid parliamentary private secretaries – MPs who try to improve relations with Tory backbenchers – from two to four.

The €43bn scheme aims to overcome Europe’s dependency on Asian computer chip makers, as governments and businesses around the world battle shortages that experts believe could persist for much of the year.  We’ll hear from Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, later when he speaks at the Society of Professional Economists annual conference, on the “UK Monetary Policy Outlook.”  European markets have open higher, with the FTSE 100 near a two-year high. Some commodity prices are also under pressure, with aluminium hitting its highest since 2008 on Tuesday. Renters around the UK are now paying £62 more each month than before the pandemic, taking the average monthly rent to £969, according to property website Zoopla. This means that the average annual rent for people who are agreeing a new let is now £744 higher than it was in March 2020 before Covid. The increase in housing costs will put further pressure on households, who are already feeling the squeeze from rising energy bills and wider price rises. Rising rents will also make life difficult for people who are looking to get on the property ladder, at a time when the price of the average UK home reached a record high of £276,759 in January, which is £24,500 higher than a year earlier, according to Halifax. However, rents in the capital are only £18 a month higher than they were in March 2020, because they fell during the pandemic. Renters including office workers and students are now returning to the centres of the country’s largest cities - including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Edinburgh – after the ‘race for space’ during the pandemic saw many people look to move to commuter areas. Here’s some reaction: Housebuilder Barratt plans to build an extra 250 more homes than previously forecast, despite concerns that rising interest rates dampens the housing market. Barratt told the City it now expects to complete between 18,000 and 18,250 homes in the financial year to 30th June, an increase of 250 on its previous guidance.  That would beat the 17,243 homes completed last year (to 30 June 2021), and above pre-pandemic levels. Barratt is also confident that the market can handle higher interest rates - with the Bank of England having raised Bank Rate twice in the last two months. It says it is seeing strong demand, with “strong total forward sales” at 30 January 2022 of 15,736 homes, higher than the 14,289 homes on 31 January 2021.  On Monday, Halifax predicted that prices will slow considerably this year, as households are squeezed by rising inflation. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, cautions that demand could soon peak: John Menzies says it has rejected an “unsolicited and highly opportunistic approach” from Kuwait’s Agility Public Warehousing, which valued it at around £469m. Menzies started out as a single Edinburgh bookshop in 1833, before opening bookstores at railway stations and on high streets, and running wholesale newspaper and magazine distribution, and later cargo transport. It is now a ‘pure play’ aviation business, operating ground handling, cargo handling, cargo forwarding and plane fuelling services at over 200 airports in 37 countries. Having been disrupted by the pandemic, Menzies says it is now “well-positioned” for the recovery in the aviation sector - which it insists isn’t recognised in today’s offer. Menszies says its “pipeline of opportunities” is full, as it focuses on air cargo services, new fuelling operations and high quality ground handling, targeting emerging markets where margins are typically higher.  Philipp Joeinig, Chairman and CEO of John Menzies plc, said: It is the second time within two months that a deal to buy the 178-year-old firm, originally known as Liverpool Victoria, has collapsed. LV began discussions with its fellow mutual Royal London at the start of the year, after its members blocked a planned takeover by US private equity firm Bain Capital in December. However, the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it had “become clear to LV that our different mutual models mean such a merger would not be in the best interests of LV members.” Seamus Creedon, LV’s interim chair, thanked Royal London for its engagement, saying LV looks forward to operating alongside it as part of a “vibrant mutual sector”. LV had previously rejected an approach from Royal London last year, worth £10m more than Bain’s offer which would have ended LV’s member-owned status.  That approach was slammed as a “hand grenade” by LV, as it struggled to persuade members, and outsiders, that the Bain deal made sense. Barry O’Dwyer, Group Chief Executive of Royal London, says today that it had engaged with LV because it thought it didn’t have a future as a stand-alone firm.  LV also announced a boardroom clear out on Monday, following its failed, controversial demutualisation plan.

Mr Fleming advised people to shop around for offers from other utility providers and suppliers, ‘rather than just complaining about what the Government is going to do for me’. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWe’ve never met but I couldn’t help but notice when you barged onto the Pricewatch patch this week and started making all sorts of headlines after telling people how they needed to shop around to ensure they would be able to make ends meet in the face of the highest spike in prices in decades.Now, I mean no disrespect but, seriously? Shopping around is my thing. It’s been my thing for years. So I’m not going to lie, I was miffed by your mini home economics lecture delivered on Drivetime although in truth, my annoyance didn’t last long.Almost as soon as you started speaking to presenter Sarah McInerney on Monday evening about what people might be able to do to counter inflation, it was clear things were not going to go well.While what you had to say was nowhere near as brazen as the lecture delivered by Charlie Haughey in the early 1980s when he chastised everyone except himself for living way beyond their means or as ridiculous as the claim made by Leo Varadkar that his was the party for people who get up early in the morning, it was still pretty tone deaf.In fact, it could scarcely have been more tone deaf, something that was immediately clear to McInerney. She gave you more than one chance to stop digging the ridiculous hole you were digging for yourself and she could scarcely hide her exasperation as you talked. But you ploughed on despite her incredulous pauses, deep sighs and direct challenges.“If you move around you can get better prices, and that’s in our own hands,” you said and pointed out that weekly shopping bills could be reduced if people were “careful” about where they shop.Here’s the thing Seán, there is a time and a place for sage advice, the like of which you were dispensing, and you got both wrong.You were being asked why the Government was moving so slowly to introduce measures that might help people out of a desperate situation and instead of answering that question in a way that might offer anything by way of hope to many thousands of people, you started sounding like some class of poor man’s Marie Antoinette, urging people who are struggling to stay warm and put food on their tables to eat cake.You could almost hear the Opposition mercilessly cackling as you told people – or, to use another word for them, voters – what they needed to do. Labour and Sinn Féin practically fell over each other as they raced to put the boot in.You deserved the kicking and I say that as someone who is on your side, at least when it comes to the business of finding the best value for money.For more than 15 years on the pages of The  I have been banging on about the need for people to shop around and I fully intend to do more of it in the days ahead. Because I know that for many people there are ways they can save themselves hundreds – if not thousands – of euro each year by just being a bit more canny.But there is a big but here and one that you seemed to forget.Yes, there are savings on the table for many people but there are many others who have been stretched as far as they can be stretched, people with absolutely no wiggle room when it comes to cutting back.There are hundreds of thousands of people who don’t have the luxury of shopping around when it comes to health insurance for the very simple reason that they can’t afford health insurance.There are many thousands more who can’t shop around for cheaper gas or electricity because they are saddled with huge legacy bills or tied to pay-as-you-go meters which often charge far more than the discounted rates that are available to people such as you and me.And they can’t shop around for food anymore because they are already put to the pin of their collar and already buying the cheapest food options they can find.Now you did apologise and you apologised fast.

Photograph: iStockBusinesses that cannot afford sick pay for staff should be exempted from the obligation to pay it, an Oireachtas committee is set to recommend.However, if a business is successful in demonstrating to the Labour Court that it cannot make the payment, employees would be compensated by the State’s Social Insurance Fund, the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise,Trade and Employment will find this week.The report is set to be published on Wednesday, but a draft copy of its findings seen by The  outlines how it will recommend an exemption based on a similar provision in the National Minimum Wage Act.During its pre-legislative hearings on the outline of the new legislation, the committee was warned it could impose a significant cost on employers, particularly smaller and medium-sized firms that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.Additional costsEmployers’ group Ibec told the committee during the hearings that firms will face additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, and that many will in practice have to operate the new statutory system alongside an existing occupational scheme.The Government’s plan envisaged giving all employees a minimum level of financial compensation if they cannot work. It is particularly targeted at those in low-paid roles who currently receive no sick pay or are not entitled to illness benefit. The legislation is intended to act as a “floor” to the benefits, with more generous sick pay schemes envisaged to remain in place.The coalition plans to introduce it over a four-year period, starting with three days per year in 2022, rising to five days in 2023 and seven days in 2024. The following year, in the final phased move, employers will pay 10 days per year. The rate will be paid by employers at 70 per cent of an employee’s wage, subject to a daily maximum of €110.Medical certificateThe committee has also recommended that employees be able to avoid the cost of obtaining a medical certificate to qualify for sick pay, which is a precondition of the payment being made. The report found that some means to rebate the cost of such certification should be made, in order to ease the financial burden on workers – particularly those on low pay.The recommendations include that there should be a minimum rate of sick pay, which members argued would address the particular needs of low-paid workers.The report also contains moves to tackle a potential practice whereby “unscrupulous” employers could put workers on a series of three-month contracts, each one terminating before the obligation to pay sick pay kicks in. It recommends that all employees be entitled to sick pay, regardless of their length of employment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"consumers face rising prices as inflation reaches levels not seen in 20 years","story":"As a result of the big squeeze, most Irish families will need to find over €2,000 more this year than they needed in 2021.

File photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsUp to 100 people were interviewed during two internal military investigations into a social event at a Dublin Army barracks during a period of Covid-19 restrictions and the alleged groping of a female soldier at the event.Minister for Defence Simon Coveney has asked senior counsel Hugh Mohan to conduct an external review in relation to the event, given the length of time between the June 25th, 2020, event at the Defence Forces’ Covid Taskforce headquarters at McKee Barracks and the internal investigations ending.An internal investigation into the barbecue event found that it did not breach Covid-19 protocols but that the event was not appropriate in the context of the social restrictions in place at that stage of the pandemic. Dozens of soldiers attended the outdoor social event at the barracks, which was held to boost morale among the taskforce team and other military personnel that had been working on the State response to Covid-19.The barbecue began in the afternoon and continued into the evening. During the evening an officer allegedly tried to grope a female soldier’s breast after he became extremely drunk. That alleged incident has been investigated by Military Police ahead of a potential court martial.Alcohol consumptionThe investigation into the event itself, which was also conducted by the Military Police, found the rules in relation to the consumption of alcohol brought in from outside the base were broken during what it called a “late lunch” that occurred between 2.30pm and 3.30pm. A number of Defence Forces personnel were reprimanded by the Defence Forces chief of staff for breaching Army rules on serving alcohol. The investigation found no breach of Covid-19 protocols as it said that people filtered in and out of the gathering, meaning that there were no more than 15 people present at any one time, which was in line with limits under Covid-19 restrictions at the time for outdoor social gatherings.Multiple sources have disputed this, however, saying that people continued drinking alcohol well into the evening and that there were estimated to be about 40 people present at one point.The investigations into the event and the alleged sexual assault were said to be substantial and time-consuming, with up to 100 witnesses interviewed in relation to various aspects relating to the two lines of inquiry. Some iniduals gave statements to investigators under caution.“It was a very complex matter,” said one source. Declined to commentA spokesman for the Defence Forces declined to comment on details of the internal Military Police investigations in light of the fact that Mr Coveney had asked for “an independent review of the handling of the investigation into the planning and organisation of the late lunch”.Minister of State Josepha Madigan told the Dáil yesterday that the alleged incident at McKee Barracks “has only reinforced” the importance of a separate independent review which will examine allegations of abuse, harassment and discrimination in the Defence Forces. It was commissioned by Mr Coveney and is being led by retired High Court judge Bronagh O’Hanlon. Ms Madigan was speaking during a Sinn Féin motion in the Dáil calling for a commission of investigation into the allegations made by the Women of Honour, a group of former Defence Forces members who have been pushing for a full statutory inquiry into allegations of misconduct in the Defence Forces.She said that Mr Coveney had “an immediate duty of care to serving members of the Defence Forces to ensure that they carry out their duties in a workplace that is safe and that the workplace culture is underpinned by dignity and equality”. She described the independent review as a “first critical step”.

Photograph:  Juan Carlos HidalgoEPAA great deal was riding on last week’s vote in the Spanish parliament on a new labour reform.The leftist government of Pedro Sánchez presented the legislation as a major gain for the country’s workers. It was also seen as a test of the resilience of the Socialist prime minister’s coalition administration, which had survived so far with the support of an array of smaller regional parties, including Basque and Catalan nationalists.After months of negotiations, leading to an unusual consensus between employers and unions, the government believed it had enough votes to push the law through, even though some of its traditional allies had declared their resistance to it.The right-wing opposition, meanwhile, saw the vote as an opportunity to humiliate Sánchez and start unravelling his fragile coalition.In the end, the reform was approved but only by one vote after a member of parliament for the conservative opposition Popular Party (PP), Alberto Casero, mistakenly voted in favour of the law.“I feel terrible, I’m a wreck, I’ve really messed up,” Casero was reported as telling party colleagues after realising what he had done.The incident-packed vote and its fallout have compounded the notion that Spanish politics is heading in an increasingly polarised direction which undermines the credentials of the country’s four-decades-old democracy.The PP has said it is appealing to the constitutional court against the decision not to allow Casero to recast his vote, with party leader Pablo Casado describing the result as a “fraud”. The Socialists argue that there is no precedent for repeating a vote because of a mistake. They have also claimed that that two conservative congressmen from the Navarre region were somehow bribed to vote against the reform.TribalismThe political commentator Fernando Vallespín noted that “hate, rather than difference of opinion, has become the driving principle that guides virtually all the political movements in our country”.Comparisons with Washington had been on many Spaniards’ minds just three days earlier, when, in a small-scale emulation of the storming of Capitol Hill in January 2021, several dozen farmers burst through a police cordon in the southern city of Lorca and broke into the town hall. They interrupted a vote by local councillors on a new regulation to ensure that intensive livestock farms, which have been mushrooming across Spain, were not built too close to residential areas. A total of seven people were arrested.Although the majority of those taking part appeared to be wearing Covid face masks and bodywarmers rather than military regalia and buffalo headdress, the incident has caused many to ask if Spain is moving in a Trumpian direction.The farmers had been taking part in a peaceful demonstration. But an apparently co-ordinated spread of misinformation escalated the situation, triggering the melees.“We were told things that weren’t true and the atmosphere got really heated,” said Pedro Giner, one man who took part in the assault, before regretting his actions. “Disinformation often makes you take decisions that make no sense and this was an example of that.”While parties on the left have condemned the incident in Lorca, the parties on the right, which have been attacking the Sánchez government for its alleged mistreatment of the farming sector, appeared to support the violent protesters. Fulgencio Gil, a local PP politician, said the episode had been the result of “continuous attacks by the Socialists” on farming families.PolarisedThe Lorca clashes appear to confirm an existing phenomenon. A 2019 study by US and Israeli academics found that Spain was the most polarised of 20 developed countries examined, which included Ireland, the UK and the United States. Spain, the report found, had “markedly more intense mass-level affective polarisation than the US”. The study only looked at each country up until 2015, but developments in recent years – including the pandemic, Catalan separatism, a far-left party in government and a surging far right – appear to have intensified the trend.The grievances of rural regions, whose depopulation and lack of infrastructure have become a national issue, reflects the existence of a deep geographical schism in Spanish society. Along with the historic left-right cleavage, or its generational and wealth gaps, Spain’s rural-urban ide is yet another symptom of the country’s polarised and, many would say, eroded democracy.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"uk health minister apologises for continuing meeting after positive covid test","story":"File photograph of lateral flow test. Photographer: Brent LewinBloombergA minister in the UK health department has apologised for continuing with a face-to-face meeting despite being told she had tested positive for Covid-19.Gillian Keegan said she was told her test was positive while meeting three men who had lost their daughters to suicide.She said she should have “immediately” ended the meeting, and described not doing so as a “mistake” and “an error of judgment”.The Chichester MP said she had told the men the result of the test but stayed on to hear their stories while taking “further precautions”.Posting on Twitter on Tuesday night, Ms Keegan said: “Earlier today, ahead of a planned visit I took a precutionary (sic) LFD test which gave a positive result. I am now isolating at home and fortunately feel fine.“When I was told my test was positive I was listening to three fathers who had tragically lost their daughters to suicide.“I told them the result and took further precautions but with their consent, I stayed for a short period to hear their stories.“I should have immediately ended the meeting and on reflection this was an error of judgment on my part.“I fully recognise the importance of following the letter and spirit of the policies, so want to be upfront about what happened and to apologise for the mistake I made.”Health minister Ed Argar said he understands the health secretary has accepted an apology from fellow minister Gillian Keegan .Asked what he would say to Ms Keegan, Mr Argar told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme: “I saw that Twitter thread, I think, late last night, I think it was. She’s clearly issued a fulsome apology there, that she did make an error of judgment, she was open about that and she accepted she made an error of judgment.”He added: “I understand — I haven’t spoken to or seen Gillian yesterday or today, so I don’t know first hand — but I understand from her Twitter thread that she set out the circumstances and apologised, and I understand that she has also spoken to and apologised to the secretary of state, who has accepted that apology.”–PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs new dash gas save us lunacy net zero","story":"For an industry facing an existential crisis in order to forestall global warming, oil and gas companies are performing remarkably well. BP announced profits of £9.5 billion shortly after Shell posted what it called “momentous” record annual takings. These huge sums are a function of the restart of the world economy after the pandemic shutdowns but are pretty mind-boggling none the less. For the green lobby they indicate that more needs to be done and faster to expedite the move to non-carbon fuel sources.For the rest of us, however, they demonstrate that the UK’s rush to achieve net zero is not being followed by the rest of the world and cannot be sustained here without a massive public backlash. The baleful consequences of this policy are finally beginning to dawn on the Government. As we reported yesterday, final approval is to be granted for six new North Sea oil and gas fields, the first sensible decision on meeting the country’s energy needs taken for at least three decades.It also gives the lie to the claim that investment in new fields was halted for economic considerations when the principal objections were environmental. For the same reason, the Government should lift the ban on fracking.The prospect of new licences in the North Sea marks a significant political push-back against net zero, with Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, seemingly determined to make the policy more rational and voter-friendly. Some of the more unrealistic targets for phasing out petrol cars or banning gas boilers need to be revisited as well.In any case, the UK is able to claim a fall in CO2 emissions in part because it outsources them elsewhere. Refusing to exploit our own reserves of gas while importing it from countries that have no renewable energy to speak of is mendacious. Continuing to import goods from countries that still burn vast amounts of coal surely does not help the planet in any way.In these circumstances, it is idiotic to withhold approval to exploit Britain’s own oil and gas supplies in the North Sea, even if it does turn out to be the last hurrah for what was once seen as the nation’s economic salvation.History repeats itself. The arrival of natural gas in the 1960s required the conversion of around 14 million households previously reliant on so-called town gas produced by burning coal. The newcomer was cleaner, cheaper and less noxious. A similar upheaval is envisaged to remove gas boilers and install energy efficient heat pumps. Some 85 per cent of the UK’s 29 million homes are heated by gas-fired boilers and the Government wants about one million to be replaced every year by 2030 compared to just 60,000 last year.How can this be brought about? The answer is that it can’t, not least because the engineers are not available and the costs to homeowners already hit by soaring energy bills are too high. It is estimated that 60,000 qualified plumbers will be needed to meet 2028 installation targets – yet just 1,800 have the correct training today. The new pumps will also be expensive, about £8,000-£10,000 for a typical three-bed home.Even if costs are brought down, this is a sizeable outlay. In another market intervention, the Government is now offering incentives for people to switch and seeking to force boiler-makers to sell a certain proportion of heat pumps to “help create the conditions for rapid innovation”.Amid all this lunacy comes evidence that the proposed move to greater electrification risks power cuts without significant changes in behaviour (leave aside what might happen if supplies are affected by a war in eastern Europe or the Gulf or both). From this week, households are to be paid to ration their power usage at peak times to relieve pressure on the National Grid as part of a trial to encourage people to charge cars and use appliances at different times during the day and night. That is why we were all being urged to switch to smart meters and move to special tariffs, though these have now been scuppered by the rise in prices.All in all, our energy policy has been an unmitigated mess for decades, with incessant governmental interference in the market and a failure to invest in nuclear power and fracking leaving us dangerously exposed to price hikes and supply crunches. The driving force behind most of our problems is the 2050 net zero target now underpinned by statute law and international treaty commitments.Every political party is signed up to this, as are most countries in the world, even though few expect it to happen. Here, the politics are potentially toxic as people see bills rise, costs increase, supplies diminish and sanctions applied while the biggest CO2 producers carry on burning oil and coal. Labour may be just as culpable for this but the governing party always gets the blame.Since natural gas accounts for more than half our primary energy consumption – and yet we import more than half of what we require – reviving North Sea investment is a no-brainer. Even the EU now recognises gas as a sustainable energy source to be used in the transition to a low carbon future.It will take time to get new rigs running, which is not going to help alleviate the Government’s immediate problems. But international instability shows that we need to secure our energy supplies in the long-term through exploiting (and storing) our own gas reserves, moving to hydrogen, investing in small nuclear reactors, expanding carbon capture and storage, and lifting the moratorium on fracking.There are signs that, apart from shale, this prudent mix is beginning to come together but it will need the Government to stand up to the green lobby in a way that it has so far been unwilling to do. We can move to a lower carbon future, but to do so by impoverishing the country and risking its energy supplies is madness.Moreover, it is feeding into the debate around Boris Johnson’s future. Many Tory MPs are less concerned about lockdown parties or injudicious remarks concerning Sir Keir Starmer’s prosecution record than the impact of high energy prices on the incomes of their constituents. The Prime Minister would be wise to back the Chancellor and the Business Secretary in a new dash for gas.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Minister apologises for \u0026#39error of judgment\u0026#39 after attending a meeting when she had CovidRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she flies to MoscowRonaldo\u0026#39s mother tries to persuade the Pope to switch teamsUkrainian soldiers prepare for urban warfare in the ruins of ChernobylAt least 14 dead and 34 injured in Colombia mudslideThe truth about the Keir Starmer video: A fifth of the slurs were about Jimmy Savile, but more called him a traitorMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dame judi dench could become oldest ever acting oscar winner","story":"If Dame Judi Dench wins the best supporting actress Oscar next month, it would be another career triumph. And it would also earn her a place in Academy Awards history.Dame Judi is nominated for her role in Belfast, Sir Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical film, playing grandmother to the young lead.At 87, she would become the oldest person to win an Academy Award for acting. The current holder of the title is Sir Anthony Hopkins, who took home the prize last year aged 83.This is Dame Judi’s eighth Oscar nomination. She has won once before, for Shakespeare in Love in 1999 - a performance that took up a mere eight minutes of screen time.Belfast went down well with Academy voters, receiving seven nominations including best picture, best director and original screenplay, best supporting actor for Ciaran Hinds and best original song for Down To Joy, which was written and performed by Van Morrison.Sir Kenneth, who based the black-and-white film on his own memories of growing up in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s a long way from the streets of Belfast to the Academy Awards.“Today, I think of my mother and father, and my grandparents - how proud they were to be Irish, how much this city meant to them. They would have been overwhelmed by this incredible honour, as am I.“Given a story as personal as this one, it’s a hell of a day for my family, and the family of our film. I thank Academy voters for their incredible and generous recognition.”The 61-year-old became the first person in Oscar history to have received nominations in seven categories. His nominations this year - for picture, director and original screenplay - can be added to nominations in previous years for best actor, supporting actor, adapted screenplay and live action short.This is the first nomination for Hinds, 68, and he said: “Having worked in this industry for nearly 50 years, I thought there wasn’t much that could surprise me still. Today I can honestly say I am astounded, thrilled and deeply grateful.”Steven Spielberg became the first director to be nominated in each of six decades, beginning with Close Encounters of the Third Kind in the 1970s followed by Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial in the 1980s Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan in the 1990s Munich in the 2000s Lincoln in the 2010s and now West Side Story.Although the remake of West Side Story has proved to be a disappointment at the box office, it received seven nominations including best director, best picture and best supporting actress for Ariana DeBose as Anita.Jane Campion became the first woman to be recognised twice for best director, this time for The Power of the Dog, which led the pack with 12 nominations. Her first was for The Piano in 1994.Benedict Cumberbatch is a best actor nominee for his performance as a sadistic Montana rancher in The Power of the Dog. Another British actor, Andrew Garfield, is in the same category for his role in Tick, Tick, …Boom!While Bafta last week snubbed Olivia Colman’s performance in The Lost Daughter and chose to recognise Lady Gaga for House of Gucci, Academy voters did the opposite.Colman is a best actress nominee while Jessie Buckley, who plays a younger version of the same character, appears in the best supporting actress category.Colman won the Oscar in 2019 for The Favourite, and described her nomination for The Lost Daughter as “bloody brilliant”.Her competition includes Kristen Stewart for Spencer, which saw her play Diana, Princess of Wales, in a fictionalised account of a fraught Christmas at Sandringham.The winners will be announced at a ceremony on March 27.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Minister apologises for \u0026#39error of judgment\u0026#39 after attending a meeting when she had CovidRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she flies to MoscowRonaldo\u0026#39s mother tries to persuade the Pope to switch teamsUkrainian soldiers prepare for urban warfare in the ruins of ChernobylAt least 14 dead and 34 injured in Colombia mudslideThe truth about the Keir Starmer video: A fifth of the slurs were about Jimmy Savile, but more called him a traitorMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"justin welby asks difficult remove slavery linked cambridge","story":"A Cambridge college memorial to a donor linked to slavery should be removed, the Archbishop of Canterbury has suggested, as the Church was criticised for its lack of ersity.The Most Rev Justin Welby waded into the debate surrounding the plaque of Tobias Rustat for the first time, asking: “Why is it so much agony to remove a memorial to slavery?”His comments before the General Synod on Tuesday come amid an ongoing court battle over the memorial to the 17th-century royal courtier at Jesus College, Cambridge. The controversy surrounds Tobias Rustat’s role as an investor in companies linked to the slave trade.Earlier at the meeting, Archbishop Welby also commented on the harassment of Sir Keir Starmer by a mob who linked the Labour leader to the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile.He described it as a sign of a society that is “forgetting God”, in the latest intervention by the Archbishop which could be seen as critical of Boris Johnson. The Prime Minister has refused to apologise for claiming in the Commons that Sir Keir failed to prosecute the notorious paedophile.The meeting of the Church of England’s legislative body was also addressed by Lord Boateng, the head of the Archbishops’ Racial Justice Commission and Britain’s first black government minister.He told the chamber that the church was too white and said that the “government frontbench looks better” in terms of ersity.Lord Boateng said: “Imagine what it is to go into a place of worship to look up and to see a monument to someone who was a party to the enslavement of your ancestors.“We are in part members and worshippers in churches who have themselves benefited from the horrors of slavery.”Lord Boateng, 70, a former Labour MP who was made parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department of Health in 1997, is responsible for leading a three-year review into how to tackle racism within the church.The Archbishop welcomed his comments and said: “We need to change our practices.“Why is it so difficult to do that? Why do they have to go through hearing how it ‘doesn’t really matter’ or it is ‘not strictly accurate’ and so on, but all they want to do is put it somewhere safer where they can comment on it, not to blow it up.”According to a court hearing regarding the future of the Rustat memorial, it causes “pain and discomfort” to the Master of Jesus College, Sonita Alleyne, who is a black woman.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Minister apologises for \u0026#39error of judgment\u0026#39 after attending a meeting when she had CovidRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she flies to MoscowRonaldo\u0026#39s mother tries to persuade the Pope to switch teamsUkrainian soldiers prepare for urban warfare in the ruins of ChernobylAt least 14 dead and 34 injured in Colombia mudslideThe truth about the Keir Starmer video: A fifth of the slurs were about Jimmy Savile, but more called him a traitorMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"give bumper defence deals british","story":"Exclusive: Give bumper defence deals to British workers - and dont just focus on priceThe Prospect union wants ministers to take more account of benefits to society rather than chasing the cheapest contractsCampaigners hope a contract for three Fleet Solid Support ships will go to a UK-led consortiumByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsMinisters have been accused of ignoring their own rules when awarding bumper defence deals. The Prospect union says the Government is failing to properly apply the “social value test”, which assesses benefits to communities when handing out lucrative contracts. The union believes the Tories have been too focused on the costs of projects and not taken enough account of the potential impact on workers and wider society.Prospect pointed to the  Ministry of Defence announcement that the UK would equip its new Apache helicopters with missiles made by US firm Lockheed Martin - despite a bid from Stevenage-based MBDA, which employs , staff. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Prospect has produced a -page report, ‘Social value and the prosperity agenda in defence’, seen exclusively by the Mirror, calling for the social value test to be bolstered to give more weight to non-price considerations and measuring tenders against “key performance indicators” such as jobs, skills and local investment.  Senior deputy general secretary Sue Ferns said: “A more rounded approach would enable the Government to use defence spending strategically to help drive its levelling-up agenda while supporting skills, and reinforcing the UK’s sovereign defence capabilities from design to build.” The union fears a £.billion deal for three naval supply ships could go to a foreign-led bid. The Government has “made clear that a substantial part of the build” for the Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will “be conducted in the UK” and “there is a requirement to integrate all ships in a UK shipyard”. But that has sparked fears a UK-led consortium could miss out, with much of the work taking place overseas. Ms Ferns added: “The MoD is responsible for around £bn of annual contract expenditure which,directed properly, can have the dual effect of supporting British business and driving the levelling-up agenda.  “To date this potential benefit has not been delivered as well as it ought to be and the Government is failing in its mission to increase the contribution to UK prosperity from defence. The main reason is that headline price is still the primary driver of procurement decisions rather than a holistic assessment that considers the impact on local communities, the economy and climate change alongside headline price.” Shadow Defence Minister Chris Evans said: “The MoD’s procurement system is failing British businesses. “From wasting billions of pounds in cancelled contracts to the social value test not being applied properly, ministers are repeatedly missing opportunities to provide and support local jobs across the country.“Our defence and aerospace industries are national assets and Labour is committed to a ‘British-built by default’ approach to defence procurement which would support the growth of the British defence sector and build resilience in our supply chains.”A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: “Social value tests are undertaken as required in our procurement and any suggestion otherwise is completely incorrect. “These tests are one of many important factors in our procurement as we seek to ensure value for taxpayers’ money, benefit to the UK and securing the best equipment for our Armed Forces.“Defence proudly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across every corner of the country and in the last year spent over £ billion with UK industry.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lockheed Martin CorporationMinistry of DefencePublic servicesThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Gillian Keegan said she had taken a precautionary lateral flow test before meeting campaigners Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen, who lost their daughters to suicide. She was informed during the meeting that her result was positive - but admitted that she stayed on to listen to their stories. NHS guidance says people who test positive for Covid should begin isolating immediately.Ms Keegan admitted that remaining in the meeting was an error of judgement in a Twitter thread later that night.The minister tweeted: Earlier today, ahead of a planned visit I took a precautionary LFD test which gave a positive result. I am now isolating at home and fortunately feel fine.  When I was told my test was positive I was listening to three fathers who had tragically lost their daughters to suicide. I told them the result and took further precautions but with their consent, I stayed for a short period to hear their stories. I should have immediately ended the meeting and on reflection this was an error of judgment on my part. I fully recognise the importance of following the letter and spirit of the policies, so want to be upfront about what happened and to apologise for the mistake I made.Health Minister Ed Argar defended her for continuing with a meeting after discovering she had tested positive for Covid-.He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: Sheaposs clearly issued a fulsome apology there, that she did make an error of judgment, she was open about that and she accepted she made an error of judgment.A spokesman for Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: The Secretary of State has spoken with the minister who has taken responsibility for her actions and made a full apology.He accepts her apology and continues to support her in her role. The trio of bereaved fathers, who raised £, on a -mile walk last year, met Ms Keegan to call for suicide awareness lessons in schools. Known as Three Dads Walking, the campaigners trekked for  days from Mr Aireyaposs home in Cumbria, to Mr Palmeraposs home in Greater Manchester and on to Mr Owenaposs in Norfolk last October. Hollywood actors Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were among those who donated to their cause.

American President Joe Biden ’s administration abolished tarfs on EU steel sent across the Atlantic last month. But Brexit meant the UK was carved out of the deal - despite Britain being part of the bloc when they were imposed in  under Donald Trump.The latest agreement between Washington and Tokyo to cancel tarfs has triggered fresh calls for the British Government to step up efforts at persuading the US to ditch them for UK steel.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletterThe Americans agreed last month to open talks aimed at abolishing the duties, which are % for steel and % on aluminium. Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on ministers to “accelerate these negotiations with the United States as a matter of urgency”. In a letter to International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, seen by the Mirror, he writes: “In the four years since the imposition of the tarfs, Conservative ministers have dithered and delayed, risking workersapos job security and the sectoraposs prosperity.” He warns the deal with Japan, which comes into effect from April, means Japanese steel manufacturers “will also now have a competitive advantage over the sector here in the UK, threatening businesses, jobs and livelihoods”. “Whilst I recognise the fact that negotiations have begun with the United States to resolve this issue, it still leaves the UK behind the EU and Japan in reaching a solution,” warns the Labour frontbencher.Speaking to the Mirror, he added: “Ministers have been asleep at the wheel as British steel and aluminium exporters suffer from the tarfs President Trump imposed in .“Under Boris Johnson, the UK is at the back of the queue for talks.“The EU and Japan both now have an advantage over UK exporters as their tarfs have already been lted.  “The Government must now speed up negotiations before any more British jobs, businesses or livelihoods are put at risk.” UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said: “This deal between the US and Japan only underlines the importance of the UK and US negotiators arriving at an agreement soon. “The Japanese steel sector exports far more to the US than the UK sector does, and is far more impactful on the US market. “This deal means that from April, EU and Japanese suppliers will have an advantage in this high value market over UK producers.  “The UK Government well understands the importance of this to the UK industry and, we’re confident, is making every effort to secure the best deal possible. “We urge negotiators on both sides to arrive at an agreement that allows UK producers and US customers access to the US market without these punitive tarfs.” Community steelworkers’ union national officer Alun Davies said: We strongly back the letter to the Trade Secretary and call for urgent action to get Britain to the front of the queue for a tarf-free deal and protect our steel industry.  “The Government urgently needs to strike a deal with the US that will see our steel manufacturers enjoying the same tarf-free access to the US market as their European competitors.“Our steel industry was already at a competitive disadvantage due to higher electricity prices than our European competitors, and the continuation of these tarfs only worsens the problem.Ms Trevelyan tweeted it was “Good to see the US taking steps to resolve tarf issues” and that “talks are well underway” on thrashing out a solution to UK tarfs.  She said she looked forward to talks with US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo “this week to maintain momentum and discuss a deal that works for our vital steel  aluminium industries”.

Suzanne Webb, a minister for Trade, Women and Equalities boasted just look at our record insisting the Government will continue to be the Government of low taxes. Ms Webb claimed removing the VAT on fuel and energy bills would disproportionately benefit wealthier households. But MPs laughed and jeered as she claimed the Tories were solving the crisis. The Resolution Foundation says the measures will leave the average household £ a year worse off, or .% of their disposable income, in  .  And energy bill also rising in April could bring gas and electricity fees to % of the entire budget for Britain’s poorest households - up from .% last year.During the opposition day debate, Labour MPs shared heartbreaking stories of their constituents having to rely on food banks in the st century and families expressing their fears of rising energy bills.Only  Tory MPs showed up to the debate on the cost of living crisis and food insecurity, as the PM reshuffled his team in a bid to shake-up Downing Streetaposs apospartyapos culture. Labouraposs Carolyn Harris shared a heartbreaking message she received from one of her constituents in Swansea East who had been unable to allow their kids to taste brussel sprouts because of food insecurity left unsolved by the Tories. Ian Lavery also shared a message from a single parent in his Wansbeck constituency. The constituency told him: Itaposs dficult to imagine without experiencing it. How tiring being skint is. How youaposre so utterly consumed by financial hardship that it consumes every decision you make on a daily basis. It takes up every thought you make, you canapost escape. No wonder thereaposs a mental health crisis. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron urged the Government to cut VAT on fuel and energy bills in order to solve the crisis.The only useful thing one could do having left the European Union, the one silver lining and they won’t deploy it, so why not cut VAT on fuel bills and give people that relief that they desperately need, Mr Farron told MPs.There’s too little being done to help those whose need is the greatest.”  But Ms Webb accused opposition MPs of playing the blame game rather than offering solutions to support families and over and actually overlooking what is actually really happening. I am acutely aware of the challenges my constituents are currently facing. With cost of living and rice on food and energy bills. This is an international issue that countries everywhere are facing. Iaposm surprised that the opposition decry the government presiding over falling wages and the lack of job opportunities. Why is it not this conservative government that introduced the national living wage in  , before adding Iaposm surprised that the motion limits the government supposethis government will continue to be the government of low taxes. MPs jeered and laughed in unison but she pressed on. I am pleased that this government is being honest with people by proposing practical policies to support families with rising energy prices, Ms Webb added. Hours before the opposition day debate took place, experts warned people will struggle to eat and heat their homes as they pay around £million worth of lost consumer cash from collapsed energy companies. Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at the National Energy Action charity told the Business, Energy and Industry Committee that Brits on the lowest incomes will be the hardest hit by the tax hikes from April, as they reside in the least-fuel efficient homes. Mr Smith also warned: “People used to talk about the choice between heating or eating. It’s getting to a situation where people won’t be able to do either satisfactorily.  He expects . million households will not be able to keep their homes warm despite the Government’s latest proposals. Energy bills are set to increase by % from April for millions of households across the country. It could equate to a rise of £ per year for the average household. Jim McMahon Shadow Environment and Food Secretary accused the Government of actively making matters worse as Brits are struggling to afford food in the cost of living crisis. Ms Harris told MPs a family in her constituency thanked her for running a campaign that allowed them to celebrate Christmas. “They usually rely on food banks and whilst they are extremely grateful to the food banks, they said it felt amazing not to feel like it’s charity stuff with black marks on the tins.They felt overwhelmed they had been able to give their children a proper Christmas dinner without tinned potatoes. Their two-year-old child had never tasted a fresh potato, let alone a brussel sprouts or a parsnip.”Shadow Environment and Food Secretary Jim McMahon blasted the Tories for making the crisis actively worse - their lack of inaction forcing people to rely on food banks. Tory MP for Peterborough Paul Bristow shouted thataposs what food banks do in the chamber. Despite this, Mr McMahon added: Food banks rely on the charity of our neighbours. Thataposs a reality. How are we going to tackle the cost of living crisis when our neighbours are struggling to secure food too  In the same debate, Tory MP Lee Anderson was accused of intimidation for calling Labouraposs Mr Lavery a coward. Mr Anderson insulted Mr Lavery after his repeated requests to intervene during the opposition day debate.At the start of the day, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned MPs their words have consequences after Labour leader Keir Starmer was hounded by a mob near Parliament.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VATBP made a profit of almost £billion Image: © BP PLCopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb |comments Cash machine BP might not know what to do with all its money but we do – spend it on a windfall tax to cut soaring fuel bills.The near £billion profit – following Shell’s £bn bonanza – shows BP and other North Sea producers could easily afford to share lottery wins triggered by rising global prices. Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves. A Brit special Brits starring in Oscar nominations and at tonight’s Brits awards is great news. When it comes to films and music, we’re seen and heard all around the globe.

Mr Javid, writing in the Daily , said the NHS aimed to recruit , more nurses from overseas and , more healthcare support workers by the end of March to increase capacity. He on Tuesday set out in the Commons how the NHS would tackle the backlog built up during the Covid- pandemic, including new targets for reducing long waits and getting people checked for illnesses more quickly.Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the plan falls seriously short of the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the misery that is affecting millions of people stuck on waiting lists. And Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper also said parts of the plan were not ambitious enough.  The MP for Forest of Dean said: Many on this side of the House were very reluctant but did support the increase in resources for the NHS through the increase to National Insurance and then the health and social care levy, but when we are making that argument to our constituents they will expect that money to deliver results. Whilst this plan is welcome, can I ask him to perhaps be more ambitious, because I think only getting to % of patients waiting less than a year by March  isnapost ambitious enough. By setting out in clear terms what patients can expect from the NHS and how they in turn can help, I hope it will also take some of the pressure off our hard-pressed health and care staff who are facing the most extraordinary workload and stress day in, day out.  About six million people in England are on the NHS waiting list for treatment, including hip and knee replacements, cataract surgery and tests. According to the plan,all  million people estimated to have stayed away during the pandemic came forward for treatment, and activity was not increased above pre-pandemic levels, the waiting list could hit  million. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Javid said , people were waiting longer than a year for care before the pandemic but that figure is now over ,. Assuming half of the missing demand from the pandemic s over the next three years, the NHS expects waiting lists to be reducing by March , he said. Addressing long waits is critical to the recovery of elective care and we will be actively offering longer-waiting patients greater choice about their care to help bring these numbers down.  The plan will focus on four areas of delivery: increasing health service capacity together with the independent sector prioritising diagnosis and treatment reforming care such as making outpatient appointments more focused on clinical risk and need, and increasing activity through dedicated and protected surgical hubs. As previously announced, some nine million additional treatments and diagnostic procedures will be brought in by , while the admin burden on staff will be cut. NHS England said this will mean that over a three-year period, patients will be offered around  million more diagnostic tests - an increase in capacity of a quarter compared with the three years prior to the pandemic. The plan further promises to create dozens more community and NHS-based sites for surgical procedures and convenient, quick diagnostic checks, towards our ambition of a network of surgical hubs and diagnostic centres covering the entire country. This is in addition to the network of  surgical hubs already operating. Teams of specialists will be deployed to help patients prepare for their operations, and groups of clinicians and teams will be able to get instant access to test results, offering patients faster clinical advice.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the plan was the biggest catch-up programme in the history of the health service backed by unprecedented funding.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSNational Insurance Company Ltd.Mark HarperBoris JohnsonPoliticsSajid Javid MPCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: Getty Images Blend ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |comments The Government has been accused of denying structural racial inequality exists as figures show black women are % likely to experience pregnancy loss.Shadow Women and Equalities Minister, Taiwo Owatemi said the Tories have failed to prioritise the inequalities in healthcare that are leaving black womenaposs lives at risk. Women of all ethnicities have dficulties during pregnancy and the care associated with it. But black women are at a high risk of miscarriage and are vulnerable to long-term health problems like blood clots, heart disease and depression. Lancet analysis of data on . million pregnancies in seven countries found the risk is % higher than for their white counterparts.  And black women are also four times more likely to die during childbirth in comparison to their white counterparts. Isabel Gomes Obasi from Coventry said giving birth was traumatic because doctors didnapost listen to her and she was left questioning herself.I just shut down, she told the BBC. The experience made me anxious and depressive,not suicidal.Asked why she was not listened, she said reluctantly, the colour of my skin. Adding, the attitude of some staff was: You have black skin - you are not from here - you can wait.  Ms Owatemi said: “The appalling entrenched inequality that leaves Black women at a much higher risk of pregnancy loss is a damning indictment of the Conservative government. “For over a decade, ministers have failed to prioritise Black women’s health and failed to tackle the deep-seated structural inequalities in healthcare that are putting them at risk.“While Labour has called for a national strategy to tackle health inequalities, with ministerial accountability and targets, the Conservatives have delayed a women’s health strategy for England and denied structural racial inequality even exists.“The next Labour Government will treat Black, Asian and minority ethnic women with respect by bringing in a Race Equality Act to tackle structural racial inequality at source.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyPregnancyGiving birthMental healthMiscarriagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There can be no doubt that MPs of all stripes are well aware of the realities of the cost of living crisis we face.That’s why the Labour Party tabled a motion in the Commons, putting forward suggestions on how to tackle an inflation crisis of the Conservatives’ own making. We urged the government to set out a national strategy for food, including how it intends to ensure access to high quality, sustainable, affordable food for all and meet the United Nations goal to end hunger by .Yet not a single Cabinet minister bothered to turn up until the th hour – too busy shuffling the deckchairs on the prime minister’s doomed vessel, as he scrabbles to save his job.  Those who are responsible are failing to do anything about the spiralling cost of your weekly shop, brought about in no small part by their failure to make Brexit work and properly support British suppliers and producers. It’s becoming something of a pattern for this government. No accountability and no grip on reality. Far too many of us know all too well the consequences of not being able to afford to live. As I told the House, the darkness of poverty isn’t just not being able to turn the lights on. It’s being driven into debt and despair, keeping your curtains are closed even in the day-time - because you’re fearful of the debt collector knocking on the door. Labour has set out a plan to cut the cost of energy bills, saving the poorest households about £. The time for this government to refocus its efforts is long overdue. Labour’s contract of security, prosperity and respect with the British people will end the cycle of high tax and low growth that has mired working families in perpetual instability for the last decade. We have set out a fully costed plan to keep bills low and support British business to bolster sustainability and affordability of good quality food. The Tories now stand on their record. They’re all out of ideas, their leader has run out of road and the British people have run out of patience.

Heres everything you need to knowThe DVSA has proposed six changes to driving tests Image: Getty Images iStockphotoBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsPreparing for driving tests can be daunting, with Highway Code revision to cram into your brain and hopes of a smooth run when out for the test itself. After a range of new Highway Code changes were enforced on January , , it seems budding drivers will have to brush up on their knowledge of the rules. And, with the pandemic causing chaos for driving test and theory test bookings, it seems there could be more trouble ahead for those looking to pass their test and get behind the wheel. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency DVSAhas proposed a range of changes to driving tests due to demand being at the highest it has aposever knownapos. Due to the scarcity of test slots, it has caused many learner drivers to book in tests far earlier than they are ready for.So, here are all of the DVSAaposs proposed changes for driving tests that could be enforced in just months. What are the DVSAaposs six proposals for driving test changes in   . Ensuring learner drivers are prepared for their driving test  Perhaps the most crucial element for budding drivers is that being prepared for your upcoming driving test is more vital than ever. The proposal suggests extending the amount of time you will need to wait before rebooking a car driving test, after failing one, to  days — you currently need to wait just  days.This move is also being pushed to allow for more training time to prevent retakes from being done with no further training. The DVSA states that, due to long waiting lists for lessons, slotting in time for extra training is tricky for driving instructors.With the proposed -day extension, there is a greater window of opportunity for learner drivers to take top-up lessons so they are better prepared for the car driving test.  This change would apply solely to car driving tests. The following would not be affected by this:other types of driving tests, such as motorcycle tests, heavy goods vehicleand bus driving tests theory tests approved driving instructortests. Forcing learners to give more notice for car driving test cancellations Finding time for a driving test booking can be tricky due to shortages of slots, and all sorts of surprises can crop up in day-to-day le leading to test cancellations. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that , driving tests were cancelled between April , , and December , , alone. The new proposal suggests forcing learner drivers to give  days of notice when cancelling their car driving test to avoid losing their fee. They currently only need to give three days of notice when cancelling a car driving test.  This would not be enforced for reasons like bereavement, illness and other circumstances decided by the DVSA. The change would allow for fewer driving test slots being wasted, and therefore it could potentially lead to a higher volume of tests being available to book. When the fee loss policy was temporarily lted during the pandemic, the DVSA found that there was an increase in tests being cancelled at the last minute. This reduced signicantly upon the fee loss police being reintroduced for short notice period cancellations. . Identying data surrounding how well driving instructors prepare learner drivers  The DVSA has proposed a method to easily identy which driving instructors need the most help and support with providing high-quality training. It suggests introducing a legal requirement for them to display their approved driving instructoror trainee driving instructor registration certicate in the windscreen of their car when brining people to driving tests. The DVSA explained the reasoning behind this, and said it would:encourage driving instructors to only bring people for their driving testthey’re confident they will pass help us improve our ability to identy and prioritise which driving instructors most need help and support to provide high-quality training mean that we can treat all driving instructors bringing pupils for tests consistentlyCurrently, driving instructors are only legally required to do this when carrying out driving lessons, but not for driving tests. However, many do so voluntarily.  If enforced, DVSA driving examiners would record the instructoraposs personal reference number and the test results can then be linked back to them. This would then allow the DVSA to identythe driving instructor needed a standards check. The proposal could mean that driving instructors who refuse to display the certicate could lose the approval to teach. It would also help the DVSA to identy and remove instructors from the register who are not offering high-quality training. . Offer more information about driving instructors to learners  While learner drivers can currently see the name, phone number, email address and distance of the driving instructor, the DVSA is pushing for more transparency. The proposed changes are displaying the following information deduced from a rolling -month period:average number of driving faults their pupils make per test average number of serious faults their pupils make per test percentage of the driving instructors’ pupils tests where the driving examiner had to take physical action in the interests of public safety overall pass rate for the driving instructors’ pupils. Changes to learner driver eyesight checks during driving tests  The DVSA has suggested a change in the law surrounding driver eyesight checks during driving tests, with the ability to do eyesight checks in dferent levels of light and use ious methods to test eyesight. At present, the law only allows for eyesight checks in good daylight and the test involves reading a registration plate on a parked vehicle up to  metres away. The changes would apply to car, motorcycle, tractor, specialist vehicle and approved driving instructorand part driving tests.  The move would allow for more flexibility for driving test times offered, and to ensure drivers meet eyesight standards under a range of conditions. Additionally, it would prevent test cancellations when there is poor light. . Swapping paper pass certicates for digital pass certicates The DVSA has proposed paper pass certicates for driving and theory tests should be swapped for digital versions. If passed, this will apply to all driving tests and would be in-line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyefforts to create a digital driving licence.  The move would not only prevent people from losing physical copies, but it is also likely to help the environment with a lack of need for over two million sheets of paper printed annually. Why are the driving test changes being proposed by the DVSA and when would they be enforced  The DVSA has proposed these six driving test changes due to a a range of factors, but it is predominantly due to a vast increase in demand for driving tests. The website states additional reasoning for the change proposals, with the hopes that they will:encourage learner drivers to be better prepared for their driving test help to reduce the number of driving test appointments that are wasted give us more flexibility in how and when we can carry out driving testsWhen will the DVSA driving test changes be decided and how can I have my say The DVSA encourages people across the UK to have their say about the driving test changes on its website.The consultation vegan on January , , and will close at .pm on March , . Following the responses, the next steps will be decided and published within three months of the consultation closing, so by June , .

Kate joined families at the activity and wellbeing session run by PACTat MumSpace in Southwark today. Kate, a champion of research into early childhood, heard about the challenges faced as she joined in with a cooking workshop during the visit. She helped young children chop and eat fruit to the soundtrack of a catchy song about bananas.Have your say on the latest royal developments in the comment section She spoke to parents about the importance of a “holistic” system to ensure isolated new mothers and their babies do not “fall through the cracks”. Hearing how PACT runs “Parent University” courses for expectant parents and those with newborn babies, the duchess heard how mothers were learning about social and emotional development as well as the basics about labour and feeding. Josephine Namusisi-Riley, who leads PACT in Southwark, and health visitor Simonette Guerra described how the course dealt with the importance of the early years, including brain and language development and play. “As a new mum I would have liked that,” the Duchess said. “I think I would have learned a lot. The importance of play.”  She added: “What’s so fantastic is seeing the amazing work that’s going on here. That support you’re providing is amazing. The science backs it up.” Kate helped two-year-old Jonathan – who was wearing a smart shirt and celebrating his birthday – chop up his banana. His grandmother Grace told her that the sessions featured “a lot of children and many, many toys”. “Has it helped your relationship with him ” Kate asked, breaking off to say “Good job” to the youngster who was eating nicely.  Going to shake the hand of one mother, she laughed: “Sorry, now I’ve got a sticky hand,” before pulling a face of amazement at Zoe, a nearby one-year-old, who was busy eating strawberries. “I can see why everyone likes it here,” Kate added. Kate watched children climbing up a frame to go down a slide, and accepted a ‘cup of tea’, full of kinetic sand, from a boy called George – the same name as her eldest. Playing along, she took her mask off for a pretend sip before saying thank you and passing it back to him.The duchess spent time with Laura Barber, mother of two-year-old Rebecca, who talked about mental health and the challenges of parenting in isolation. Ms Barber said: “She saidshe had had something like this, she would have appreciated it too.” MumSpace playgroups are free weekly sessions organised by PACT to allow mothers to share the ups and downs of motherhood. Kate, has set up the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, is said to focus much of her charity work on early childhood and how it affects outcomes in later le.  Kate will also meet a health visitor who regularly provides the group with advice and signposting to other services, before joining a cooking workshop with parents and children. Through her work over the past decade The Duchess of Cambridge is understood to have seen first-hand how some of today’s hardest social challenges have their roots in the earliest years of a person’s le. The Duchess says she is committed to raising awareness of the importance of early childhood experiences and of collaborative action to improve outcomes across society.

All  members of staff - including those who only recently joined the team - will be invited on the trip.The four-day break is set to cost the firm more than £,, Wales Online reports. We might be one of the first Cardf based companies for such a company-wide , all expenses paid employee holiday and thataposs only possible because we strive to be #Bright#Bold#Better in everything we do, internally and externally, the firm wrote in a Facebook post announcing the holiday.The post said that all of its staff, including new starters who were hired in January and February, would be taken on the holiday. The team will be staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace hotel near Playa de las Americas.  Rooms at the hotel for the first weekend are currently retailing at around £ a night. Chief Commercial Officer Pavan Arora said:  was a really tough time on our whole industry - we went from the jobs market being put on hold to going into overdrive. Our staff have been on a journey, from going to remote working to hybrid back to remote... so we just wanted to put our arms around everyone and say thank you for the last two years. Itaposs employee care and we want to make sure everyone feels appreciated for the hard work theyaposve done over the past two years. Rebecca Bond, who has been with Yolk for four years, said: After what can only be described as an eventful year, in which everyone at Yolk worked harder than ever, I am so pleased to say that we are off on our free holiday. What makes it even better, is that we are off on our holidays all together. Recruitment is well known for being a tough and competitive industry, so I can only thank Yolk Recruitment for putting an incentive together that is truly inclusive and ensures that everyone wins. I don’t think anyone quite believes that instead of going to the office, we will be jetting off with  recruiters on a plane. Thank you to all of my amazing colleagues that have made this happen as a collective, and the owners for putting their people first – I can’t wait to have a drink with you by the pool to celebrate.”  Matthew Morgan, who has been at the company for three weeks, said that he was thrilled to find out that he would be joining the team on the holiday. I must admit I was a little surprised at first, thinking someone was pulling my leg having only been there a week - picking on the newbie, he said. I soon found out that it was true and straight away I felt at home and valued as an employee working at Yolk. I’ve worked in a few dferent environments where incentives are mainly for the top performers, however being involved in a company where the culture is aposeveryone winsapos really makes it feel like a team environment, all working to achieve the same goal.

The young boy suffered fractures and was saved thanks to two blood transfusionsCharlie Golden pictured in hospital after the car collisionByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsThe family of an -year-old who miraculously survived a horror car collision have told how heroic blood donors saved his le. Charlie Golden was crossing the road outside his home when the massive blow to his head removed his scalp and fractured his pelvis in four places. Medics had to physically hold his head for five hours because they couldn’t stop the bleeding until two transfusions eventually saw him pull through. Trauma incidents happen every day in Britain and many patients will only survivethere is quick access to enough blood. Around a third of blood donated goes to patients undergoing emergency surgery. Mum Lauren explained Charlie, then aged eight, was leaving their house in Aylesham, Canterbury, and was about to show friends a shortcut to their local park. “His dad Paul called out to Charlie to be careful on the road, like he always did, and watched them cross from the bay window,” she told the Mirror.  “That’s when he saw the car hit our boy, right outside the front door. He just shouted ‘he’s been hit’ and ran out of the door. “Paul and a neighbour basically held his head together and started to stem the bleeding.” Charlie’s scalp had been “degloved” and the injury was so severe that he was put into a coma on the roadside before being airlted to Kings College Hospital in London. Charlie was in critical condition for  hours while two blood motorbikes arrived bringing extra blood to the hospital to keep him alive. Lauren said: “He would have diedthere had not been enough blood available in the area at that time. “I remember lying next to Charlie in his hospital bed and really wishing that I had donated.“A few days after the accident, I put an appeal out on Facebook to all my family and friends pleading with them to donate blood as I knew that the generosity of others had just saved my little boy’s le. “Blood is one of those things you just expect to be there when you need it, but I hadn’t stopped to consider where it comes from.” The NHS is , regular blood donors short of what it needs to recover from the Covid- pandemic. With stocks in England now supplied by the smallest pool of donors ever in the st century the Mirror is campaigning for readers to register to help make up the shortfall. Around three quarters of a million selfless donors kept hospitals in stock at the height of the Covid- crisis but this was , fewer regular donors than the year before. Charlie survived but lives with an acquired brain injury that means he has some learning dficulties. Lauren and husband Paul now regularly give blood. Lauren said: “The other day, I received a text message telling me which hospital my blood has been issued to. “All I could think of were those amazing people who received that same text when their donation saved my Charlie’s le. “A lot of people played a huge part in Charlie surviving this terrible accident. Without someone somewhere donating the blood that Charlie was given, he would have died.” How you can help Register as a blood donor today and play your part in the NHS recovery. Patients need blood all year around and the NHS needs to ensure a steady supply. In some areas of the country there are limited appointments for first time donors soyou cannot find a slot straight away please search a few weeks or months ahead.

Nicholas Hutchins, who admitted he had jealous tendencies, hatched a plan to stab his we to death before killing himself after she left him. At around am on July , , Hutchins waited in an alley outside the house she was staying in on Valley Row, Sutton, armed with a seven inch kne, My London reported.

Mrs Hutchins blocked the kne with her arm, leaving her bleeding heavily with four stab wounds, before a neighbour rushed out and pinned her husband to the ground. After his arrest Hutchins said: If I canapost have her, no one can have her. Hutchins, of Wellow Walk in Carshalton, appeared in Croydon Crown Court today after pleading guilty to attempted murder. The court was told that he had a history of violence towards his we and at the time of the attack he was on police bail for stalking her. The court heard that the couple had been married for more than three decades and had two children together, but Mrs Hutchins said he had been possessive throughout their relationship.

When she ed from the show he was very drunk and he called her a slag before punching her in the face as she removed her makeup. As she blocked his punch he broke her knuckle. On that occasion she called the police and he was arrested, but was only convicted of harassment rather than assault and got off lightly with a suspended sentence. Judge Nicholas Ainley described this as the first warning sign of the violence that was to come. The couple were still together in March  when she went on a trip to Butlins with her sister. When she didnapost answer his calls he called her a slag, causing Mrs Hutchins to fear he might attack when she got home. A few days later she went back to the house they shared, accompanied by police. They found Hutchins in the garden with her clothes in a pile doused in white spirit. Hutchins was holding a lighter and threw spirit over the two officers who accompanied her. When he was arrested he admitted to officers: I get jealous about things, not silly jealous, maybe jealous isn’t the right word. I love her to death, she’s the only girl I’ve ever known. The only girl I’ve ever kissed.” On this occasion he was given a community order for assaulting emergency workers and attempted to destroy property. At this point Mrs Hutchins decided to leave her husband and moved in with her sister and her sisteraposs partner. But a few months later, in July, Hutchins began stalking his we. He chased the bus she was on and then he turned up at her sisteraposs home begging to see her. She reported these incidents to police, who charged him with stalking and released him on bail with the condition that he couldnapost contact her. On July , , just days after he was released on police bail, Hutchins decided he would try to kill his we. As she left to get a bus to Mitchim at am he was hiding in an alley. As she walked past she didnapost recognise him until he was around three metres away. He came towards her, raising a hand above his head and said: I love you, you shouldnapost have left me. She thought he was going to punch her so put her hand up to block but felt a sharp pain and realised she had been stabbed. While she managed to block his kne a neighbour ran out and tackled him to the ground. Her sisteraposs partner then joined the neighbour in pinning Hutchins to the ground until police arrived. As Mrs Hutchins was taken to an ambulance Hutchins called out: I love you. He was arrested before being taken to a doctor for injuries he sustained while he was pinned to the ground. While talking with a doctor Hutchins confessed his plan, saying he wanted to “kill her and then kill myself”. He was arrested for attempted murder. In a victim impact statement read in Court, Mrs Hutchins said she felt as though her husband had “stolen” her future. “I also feel like Iaposve lost my husband,” she said. “Although he wasnapost the best he was my husband. I also feel that my children and grandchildren have lost him. I also feel sorry for his family as they have lost their brother or son. His mother wonapost talk to me as she feels it was my fault. I never wanted this to happen. I just wanted him to get help. Defending him in court, Nasreen Shah said his behaviour could be explained by a brain injury he suffered in . A piece of scaffolding fell on him in his workplace, causing a build up of fluid on the brain. He had a shunt fitted and was on medication with strict instructions not to drink alcohol. However, he had fallen into a pattern of drinking resulting in violent outbursts and memory loss, Ms Shah told the court. However, Mrs Hutchins disputed that this injury changed him as a person, and said that he was possessive and controlling long before his injury. On the day of the attack he had drunk six cans of beer, telling police he had done it for Dutch courage. He initially pleaded not guilty to attempted murder but on the day of his trial he changed his plea to guilty. Sentencing Hutchins, Judge Ainley said: His attitude was thathe couldnapost live with her, no one  could. He tried to kill her that day. This man presents a real and very present danger to his we. He gave Hutchins an extended sentence of  years, made up of  years in prison and then a further three years on licence.

Charlene McKerrow, , defied her Criminal Behaviour Order  times and stole more than £, items from high street stores.She appeared on a police most wanted list and clocked up  offences and repeatedly went on the run, sleeping on sofas at the homes of friends in Bolton, Greater Manchester.This week, despite being branded a high risk of reoffending by probation officers, McKerrow was given  months jail suspended for two years after she insisted she was now battling to get herself clean whilst on remand behind bars.At Bolton Crown Court, she appeared via video link from Styal Womenaposs Prison in Cheshire as she admitted  breaches of a CBO and seven offences of the theft.Sentencing Judge Tom Gilbart told her: You have an appalling history for stealing from shops and repeated anti-social criminality.  It is well know how hard it is been for town centre shops in the last few years and for frontline staff in particular and you were persistently going into them to steal. But you have very troubling and sad personal history and have never had counselling or therapy for your mental health issues relating to your childhood experiences. Instead you habitually entered into violent or abusive relationships and you have problems with your accommodation. I have reflected long and hard about your situation but you have now attempted to move away from your drug use and accommodation has been found for you. But you know what will happen to youyou fail to do what is expected of you. The graph curve of human improvement is rarely a straight line and perhaps the easier option would be to send you to prison but the best outcome in the interests of the public would be for you to take this opportunity and address your long standing issues with drugs. I suspect other judges might not have given you this opportunity.  The court heard McKerrow was said to have led a chaotic lestyle due to domestic violence she witnessed at home whilst growing up. She was placed in care and left school at  with no qualications. During her criminal career she attacked passengers on a bus, went on a foul mouthed rampage at a takeaway and was involved in a robbery in which  year old girl had a can of beer poured over her head before she was robbed of her mobile phone. Of the  offences,  involved thefts and  were breaches of court orders and she had been given conditional discharges, community orders and suspended sentences. In  she was jailed for five years and three months for wounding after she smashed a bottle of lager in the face of another woman leaving her scarred for le and needing  stitches.  Following her release she kept dodging parole and supervision appointments and in December  she was issued with a two year CBO for three shoplting offences, two public order matters and harassment. The order meant McKerrow was banned from Bolton town centre shops but in the ensuring months she was seen frequenting her old haunts and she repeatedly stole from local stores claiming she had a kne hidden in her pocket. Miss Gwen Henshaw prosecuting said: Between June and November , she stole from ious shops and on occasion left the victims in fear by claiming she was in possession of a kne whilst she took items. In a pharmacy she lted several items off shelves and hid them under a blanket. When challenged she said she had a kne and left without attempting to pay. She then ed to the same store two hours later to steal more items but this time was not challenged as the staff were so fearful that she might use the knechallenged. There were deliberate and persistent breaches of the Criminal Behaviour Order. During her spree McKerrow also preyed on stores including Clinton Cards, Poundland, Aldi, Card Factory and stole around £ pounds worth of items. She was arrested and locked up last November. In mitigation defence lawyer Nick Ross said his client had prescribed the heroin substitute methadone. He added: She understands that continuing to conduct herself in this way is wholly unacceptable. But there has been a sea-change in her le since she was remanded. She has been doing her utmost to the turn the boat round and start a high level of engagement with her methadone reduction programme. She is highly motivated -she given a chance andshe blows it, she will hand herself in. McKerrow will also have to complete a nine month drug rehabilitation programme and was made subject of a new CBO for five years. She will have to report back to the judge every six weeks as part of court checks on her progress.

But this mildness is reportedly most noticeable in patients who have already been vaccinated. Most children have not been vaccinated, which experts believe has opened a route for Omicronaposs mutations to hit them harder.  Dr Andrew, who works at Primary Children’s Hospital in Utah, said: There is reason to think that acts dferently in younger children. We are seeing the sht towards more disease in younger children that probably has to do with changes in the virus.Dr Andrew says Omicron seems to attack the upper airways to a greater extent than the lungs, reports The Sun. And because younger children have smaller airways, it affects them dferently. The doctor said the children who became unwell enough with Omicron to need hospital care often presented with a specic cough - that sounds like a dogaposs bark, he said. This type of cough, described as croup-like by medics, is not thought to be harmful to the kids. But it is still unpleasant for parents hearing the harsh sound, which can naturally increase their concerns. The sinuses of children are smaller than adults, and can become blocked easily, and in turn cause inflammation that can spark a harsh cough. A common cold infection experienced as mild by an adult, could cause more problems for a child. When Omicron settles and causes inflammation in the upper airway, infected children will present a cough that seems more severe and may even need breathing assistance, Dr Andrew said.Omicron also infects patients in a dferent way to the previous strains - which ed deeper into the lungs where it could cause more le-threatening illness. At the end of last year, experts shared a list of the specic Omicron symptoms parents should watch out for in children.

Lesley Hill claims her top-up payments have been going directly to other companiesapos bank accounts for six years.It means Scottish Power hadnapost received a payment from Lesley since , despite her putting money into the pre-paid meter every week. The mum-of one was sent letters warning her of her debts before she took the matter to the Ombudsman. An investigation ordered Scottish Power to apologise and recommended the firm issue a aposgoodwill awardapos. Lesley, , from Knightswood, Glasgow, said the Ombudsman offered her £ but has criticised the gesture as aposlaughableapos.  She has called on the energy supplier to clear her debts and claimed it was their mistake. Lesley said: Iaposm still here, sitting with this debt until it is resolved. I donapost understand why they canapost just clear it and write it off for me, and fix it in the background  Scottish Power has admitted it was their mistake, so why am I still suffering from this debt  The Ombudsman said that they would give me £ as a goodwill gesture but I think that is pretty poor and laughable, really. I have had sleepless nights, heart palpitations and stomach pains due to this. I had to call my GP today to increase my anxiety medication because I just donapost see this nightmare ending any time soon. Lesley switched from a credit to a pay-as-you-go account in  after the breakdown of her marriage. At the time, she owed the energy firm £ - which she agreed to pay up in weekly instalments. She said the meter worked perfectly for one year before she started receiving warning letters from Scottish Power over arrears. Lesley said the energy giant is yet to accept the recommendations by the Ombudsman.  She said: The count number on the meter had been added with an extra digit and that is somehow why the money ended up going to three separate companies instead of Scottish Power. I have asked the Ombudsman how many extensions they are legally allowed to get because I fear this could go on for years. Two of these companies have gone bust and I just know that the matter wonapost be resolved in  days. It just feels as though I am fighting a losing battle and that it wonapost be fixed any time soon. It shows that no matter how hard you try to keep on top of payments, this could still inevitably happen at the end of the day and you could end up to your eyes in debt through no fault of your own. It just goes on and on. It has been a horrendous period, Iaposve been ill with stress and worry. I donapost understand how my meter worked fine for two years and then one day, it just tripped and started going to three dferent companies, I just canapost comprehend how that is possible. In a letter the watchdog has ordered Scottish Power to pursue a missing payment inquiry. This will ensure the firm allocates and applies all top-ups Lesley made to her electricity meter in the last six years to her current account. A Scottish Power spokesperson said: Weaposre very sorry for any stress this situation is causing Ms Hill. We are still working with Ms Hill and the Energy Ombudsman to fully resolve this case, including investigating where payments have been made to the other energy suppliers in order to help clear Ms Hillaposs debt.

Exposure to the poisons could spark a range of serious health conditions such as high cholestoral, type  diabetes and other conditions such as obesity which can lead to heart disease,. Those living in one particular county, south Cambridgeshire, are most at risk and the county is supplied by utility firm Cambridge Water. The company last June cut off a supply containing four times the aposlegal limitapos of perfluorooctane sulphonate . But the firm has not revealed how long people had been piped water before it was cut.  The contaminated water, it assures customers never reached taps and was instead blended with other sources.Those living in the area say they were never informed about the discovery last summer,reported.An estimated , people in the supply area are understood to have been affected.Residents of Stapleford and Great Shelford, where around , live, have heard “nothing at all” from Cambridge Water. And the title reports that while investigations happened, it “had not told the community”.  The Drinking Water Inspectorate limits PFOS to  nanograms per litre . Elinor Cordiner, head of drinking water quality and compliance at Cambridge Water, said sample surveys had happened to determinethere was any risk to customers after January . But it claomed all of the locations, apart from one, fell within tier , which the company says is the aposlowest riskapos category. A site at Duxford Airfield was in the tier  category, and tier  was the highest. Affected houses were supplied by an acquer which had PFOS levels at almost ng l - four times the legal limit.  Ms Cordiner said in a statement water supplies from this source have always been blended with other sources before reaching our customers. She added: This means that levels of PFAS at customer taps were at, or around, the tier level. The site was removed from supply as a precautionary measure and Cambridge Water is in the process of installing additional treatment at the site. It said: We confirm that we have not breeched any legal limit... We can assure customers that all drinking water in our supply region was, and remains to be, in line with expected safe levels.reports that Cambridge Water said it was “unable to guarantee a blend below ng l for our customers at all times”. But Tony Fletcher, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described levels in Duxford as “grossly exceeding recommended drinking water limits. PFOS, he said accumulate in the body and it takes a long time to remove them. The aquer sits close to Duxford airfield. and these sort of locations are known to be potentially signicant sources of PFOS according to the The Sun. Duxford airfield said no banned substances “are knowingly used anywhere across our estate” PFOS has gradually phased out since the early s after harm to the environment and human health. However, it is persistent in the environment. Due to its design, it never breaks down, dubbed a “forever chemical”.  Humans only come into contact with PFOS through contaminated food and water. A report from Public health England states:“studies with animals fed PFOS or PFOA for a long period showed effects on the stomach, liver and thyroid hormones”, but there is sparse information from human studies. At very high levels, animals exposed for prolonged periods were at risk of cancer. Jamie DeWitt, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at East Carolina University in the US, saiid people who had drank water over a sustained period have increased risk of certain types of diseases.

A resident in Devon watched the incident unfold in the Alphington area around am today. The resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Devon Live that he was inside a nearby address when all of a sudden, he heard an unusually loud noise. The driver of the van was helping a friend or a family member move in,” they said. Suddenly I heard this noise. I canapost even describe it, as soon as I heard it I flew to the window. I saw the driver jump out of the van and he was screaming, effing and blinding. The roof ripped right off the entrance pillars and was on top of the van.The eye-witness adds that, although it was an unusual incident, he is surprised that it hasnapost happened before. He said: Usually that roof is sat up on pillars, and as he has gone to drive through he has made a bad judgement error - and at some speed i can imagine - and taken it off. I am surprised it hasnapost happened sooner because when I went outside to see what had happened, I saw that one of the pillars which was in the ground was soaking wet and looked rotten.” Around -minutes after the event took place, he said fire crews were on the scene, where they were “puzzled” about what had happened. “The AA also turned up but they have both gone now,” he said. The van has been moved and cordoned off, but it is blocking some spaces for other properties. It looks like it will be there for a while now. I spoke to the driver, he says they are trying to get hold of the car park owners to seethey can pull the roof off of the van, because obviouslythey do that it will smash into pieces. The resident was told by the driver that the van is a rental and that they may have to pay for a crane to remove the roof. The driver informed me that the van is a rental, and said the insurancerefused to help, the rental company refused to help, the firefighters said they didnapost know what to do and heaposd have to potentially pay privately for a crane, and AA then arrived as and they were baffled on what to do or how to help.

I was just in ridiculous pain and could barely move it without being in tears. I thought maybe I was just being dramatic but I just couldnapost take the pain and went to the doctor. I had countless appointments and was then diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome in December last year. Itaposs just basically turned my whole le upside down. Ms Hayes believe that few people realise or know about the crippling potential side effects of the implant, and claims that the only aftercare she was given after it was fitted was an information pamphlet. She added: I get a pulsating ache that runs down my whole arm to my wrist and back up to behind my earlobe. Itaposs like an electrical shock going up and down my arm and I get a numbness in my hand. It feels like the worst sunburn you can ever imagine - I canapost wear long sleeves because my arm feels like itaposs on fire. I have to push a shopping trolley with one hand and can never use a basket.  I have to have a big bag to carry washing around the house as I canapost hold it. I donapost go out drinking anymore, firstly because I canapost because of all the medication Iaposm on and secondly because Iaposm scared in case someone bumps into me. I just want to be a completely aposnormalapos -year-old as this has all been a nightmare. Ms Hayes said her treatment options were limited and instead has to use pain management techniques to cope. She has decided to speak out to raise awareness among other young people about the potential side effects of getting the contraceptive implant. Ms Hayes said I donapost want anyone  going through this. To be honest I donapost really think thereaposs enough research behind it. Iaposve tried to look more into it and find case studies but thereaposs not enough about it. I think they should just be offering the contraceptive patch and the pill - not things that go internally into your body. I just got told there might be bad cramps - not nerve damage. You can have this done from when youaposre , but I donapost want any -year-old to be in the same situation as me. I find it terrying this can be a side effect.

Sondra Theordore has spoken about the porn impresarioaposs alleged drug use in a new AE docuseries, Secrets for Playboy. She claimed Hefner, who she dated from  to , made her buy drugs for him asshe was picking up milk. How many times did I pick up drugs for Hef  I donapost know, countless. Countless times, Sondra claimed in the show. Iaposve never told anyone any of this before. I was too ashamed for a lot of reasons. But I was a drug mule for Hef. It was nothing to him. It was like sending me out for a quart of milk. ButI got caught, my le would be over.  Hefner died at the Playboy Mansion on September , , at the age of . Sondra has argued thatthe adult entertainment magnate was alive now, he would be behind bars. She has previously suggested that he groomed her from the age of  and thatshe had been caught with drugs, he would not have come to her aid. In the docuseries Sondra said Hefner would continuously sleep with other women during their relationship, and that he had a habit of turning the issue around on her. He said, aposDo you think that they can just stay in my house and not sleep with me apos she explained. Would you have dinner guests and expect that of them  No. It was just so cold and callous and not the man that Iaposve fallen in love with. I didnapost know who this man was. The -part docuseries has just released its fourth episode and delves into the hidden truths behind the fable and philosophy of the Playboy empire through a modern-day lens.  The shows creators promise that it will unravel the glamorous mythology created by the brand over several decades, the series features archival footage and exclusive interviews with insiders from all facets of the Playboy world. Sondra said she tried to leave him many times but was reeled back in with his charm. Decades later she considers him a aposvampireapos and that he sucked the le out of girls for decades. You couldnapost satisfy him. He wanted more and more and more, she recalled. The group sex was at least five nights a week. They had a protocol. He liked to direct and you didnapost segue away from it because you could tell it irritated him.It just got ugly, I felt like I was a ringmaster, I had to put the same show on every night. In a previous episode Lisa Loving Barrett, his executive assistant during the late s and aposs, said cocaine was a aposbig dealapos in the Playboy Mansion. She claimed there was a powder room off the great hall and that a pile of cocaine was hidden under a toilet roll holder. Sondra said one of Hefneraposs dogs got addicted to the drug by licking it off the floor.Former Playboy Bunnies Karissa and Kristina Shannon recently revealed grim details of Hefneraposs bedtime ritual.The blonde twins stayed in the Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, for two years, after being recruited to live with the tycoon when he saw pictures of a glamour shoot they had done. Karissa and Kristina were flown from Florida to LA, moving in with Hefner and his girlfriends - including Kendra Wilkinson - and being given , a week to star on the hit reality show Girls Next Door, which documented the lives of the women living in the  million mansion.  They told the Daily Mirror it was worlds away from what they originally thought they would be signing up to. Kristina said they were regularly given drugs as part of Hefner’s bizarre bedtime routine, before they were forced into having group sex with the pensioner and a gaggle of other women. Karissa said they were told the drugs - including weed and quaaludes - would help them feel more comfortable. “He pulled out silk pyjamas from Italy and we put them on. He pulled out this big pill like the type a horse would take. It was quaalude, which we found out he used all the time,” Kristina said of their first experience in the tycoon’s bedroom. “He told us the drugs would help with our anxiety. We smoked some pot. We felt frozen at first but after a while the pill made us loose and fuzzy,” Karissa said, as she confessed he would touch them while they were under the influence. “He kept saying, ‘My babies, my babies,’ and cradling us as we lay either side of him. He told us to call him ‘Papa’,” she added, calling him “the devil” for what he had done to them.

The mum, from Long Island, was targeted after visiting Walt Whitman Shops in South Huntington, New York, on January .She recalled how a woman was filming her as she left the US store and then made her way home where she parked on the drive at Deer Park. But as she helped her child inside, she spotted a man get out of a gold Honda Odyssey, smash her car window and steal the designer bag. He then got back in the Honda and fled the scene, she added. Police said the force has surveillance images of the suspects. Officers have asked anyone with more information to get in touch.  During the pandemic, shop and auto thefts have risen by around  per cent throughout the US, according to the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail President Ben Dugan. The increase in crime is thought to be a knock-on effect after businesses were forced to close and people lost their jobs. Michael Lipetri, chief of NYPD crime patrol strategies, told CBS he has seen “a sharp uptick in shoplts that then turn into robberies”.  He added: “A lot of people were out of work and a lot of people were trying to make ends meet, obviously the wrong way.” Shoplting incidents in New York have reached levels not seen in almost three decades, the police department has reported. More than , such crimes were reported in New York between January and September  following more than , during the same period the pervious year. Ulta Beauty stores in Suffolk County were impacted more than  times by organised retail thieves in the first half of . “It’s brazen, and it’s a trend nationally, and certainly a trend out here,” said Mathew Lewis, chief of detectives at Suffolk County Police.

My boyfriend will try to console her when it’s just him at home with her, but she’ll just pace around the house and sit by the door waiting for me to get back. “She has such an anxious attachment to me specically that it actually makes me anxious.  “I know she looks to me for protection and safety, and I’m honoured she sees me this way. I’m proud of how far she’s come since bringing her home. “But, constantly being watched and followed is wearing on my nerves. I’m constantly having to say “Back up” or “Go get in your bed” or “Excuse me” just to get basic tasks done around my house.” The woman asked her vet to put the dog on anxiety medication - but they advised against this, instead telling her to seethe dogaposs symptoms ease in the coming months. Despite ensuring all her dog’s needs are met, and providing her with the love and attention she deserves, some have questioned the womanaposs level of care. One user said: Your dog is from two worker dog breeds that need hours of exercise a day ideally. I know it is a lot but it is what those dogs are bred to do - herd for hours and hours. With no outlet for her high energy then she will become nervous and anxious. I had a high energy dog that passed last year. He was crazy when he was younger until I started running him with an attachment to my bike. While another person said: “I have a blue heeler mix and he is literally always either eye on me or touching me. “This caused issues at first because he would try to guess where I was going so he could stay with me. “I think the moral of the story is to give it more time. She’s staring at you because she loves you, trusts you, and is trying to figure you out. “I feel like intelligent breeds like cattle dogs know that you saved them and want to be with you because they’re grateful.”Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the Daily Star reports, the photo was taken in the s when three crew members were sent to orbit to perform an engineering test of the first crewed lunar module.During the mission, they took photos of the crew member doing a spacewalk, and in the background of the image is what Tyler believes to be a UFO. What do you think of Tyleraposs sighting  Let us know in the comments...On his YouTube channel, Tyler said: This is a photo snapped by one of the astronauts doing space walks before coming safely back down to Earth. In one of the photos, they took thousands and thousands of miles away from Earth, a dark triangular craft seen above Earth in shuttle missions that happened many decades later. This was discovered to be lurking among these clouds – all the way back in the s when this photo was taken. He zooms into the picture, showing a black dot among the clouds lurking in the background. He continued: Itaposs still hard to see but when we go all the way in, we get yet another dark triangle UFO, seems to be at an angle asitaposs flying right above the clouds, right at the line where the Earth atmosphere meets space.Almost like itaposs orbiting the Earth along with the astronauts whoaposs likely when snapping this photo had no idea that this mysterious black, triangular was. His fans were convinced that the photo was a solid proof of the existence of UFOs. One said: Incredible! That photo taken from space all those years back catching that triangle is solid proof for me. Another shared: I saw a triangle flying a few months ago, but it was going flat side first not the point. Is there a chance that the astronaut photo could be space debris or something  This stuff fascinates me beyond belief! a third asked.The image bears a similarity to the infamous Black Knight UFO. Believers in the conspiracy claim the ominous dark shape of an alien origin is orbiting Earth. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Also among the tests was the first firing since  of a Hwasong- intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of striking US territories in the Pacic Ocean. A statement from North Koreaaposs Foreign Ministry said a series of tests since New Year represented remarkable achievements that strengthened North Koreaaposs war deterrence.  It also cited the Hwasong-, the longest-range intercontinental ballistic missileever launched by North Korea, which hasnapost been fired since its first test in . It is believed to have the range to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States. In todayaposs world where many countries waste time dealing with the United States with submission and blind obedience, thereaposs only our country on this planet that can shake the world by firing a missile with the US mainland in its range, it said. There are more than  countries in the world, but only a few have hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles, it said. Asked to comment, the US State Department repeated past statements that it harboured no hostile intent towards North Korea and urging ato dialogue, calls Pyongyang has persistently ignored. A State Department spokesperson also called North Korea a threat to international peace and security and global nonproleration efforts.  The United States has a vital interest in deterring , defending against its provocations or uses of force, limiting the reach of its most dangerous weapons programs, and above all keeping the American people, our deployed forces, and our allies safe, the spokesperson said. Jenny Town, director of  North, a Washington-based North Korea program, said the fact that North Koreaaposs statement came from its foreign ministry probably made the statement less threatening thanmight appear. The formulation is very passive. Not that they will do it, but that they can, she said. North Korea celebrated the anniversary of the founding of its army on Tuesday, a holiday that has occasionally featured major military parades with missiles and other weapons in previous years.  There were no reports of a parade this year, however, and state media said the day was marked by senior military leaders visiting the mausoleum of the countryaposs former rulers, among other events. US and South Korean officials have said they fear the launch of the Hwasong- on January  could be a step toward fully resuming. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test or fired an ICBM since . The United States called on North Korea on Monday to defund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and prioritise the needs of its own people. A Washington think tank said on Monday it has identied a military base close to North Koreaaposs border with China that is likely intended for stationing ICBMs. Talks to persuade Pyongyang to give up or limit its arsenal infor sanctions relief have been stalled since .

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough, this was the case against the Pupils, for the fourth time this season.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, playing Glenvale FC at Ferguslie Park, Paisley.

will be built west of Law Primary School and will replace the town’s current nursery on Law Road.However, Law Primary School’s parent council has raised concerns about the “lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way”.Construction is due to start next month, with the facility due to be completed by next year.The new building will feature a play area and garden to the north of the nursery, prompting criticism by parents of the building’s energy sustainability.Kate Allen, chairperson of Law Primary School Parent Council, said: “Our main frustrations have been the lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way, and how the nursery should be built to be as climate friendly as possible.”The parent council originally objected to the plans for the facility in May , citing two key points around creating better paths for travel and a reorientation of the building to utilise more natural light.New plans from East Lothian Councilwere released in December, with parents claiming that “very few changes to the original plans from May” had been made.The site of the new planned new early years centre at Law Primary School, North BerwickKate added: “We wrote to ELC in December asking for them to explain why this was and they never replied.“Then the plans were passed in January  without any further discussions.”Although a travel plan was not submitted in the nursery build’s original application, the council did meet with the parent council in May last year to discuss its concerns, and then submitted a comprehensive travel plan, which included many of the parents’ suggestions for future paths.The council has not, however, responded to parent council questions regarding the reorientation of the building.Kate said: “The latest report is completely unsatisfactory in terms of an explanation.“There may be a good reason but we are yet to hear one.“It was our belief that the buildings department would have to work with East Lothian Council’s Climate Change Strategy to ensure new building work should be as climate friendly as possible.“This is the question we believe needs asking of the council – are they using their Climate Change Strategy when they brief architects  If not, why not ”She added: “The delay to the build is so frustrating for staff and parents and we have only objected because we feel that these issues are so important – we want to get it right for future generations.”An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The project team has engaged with and responded comprehensively to the queries raised throughout this project both in discussions with Parent Council and Planning Department. This includes extensive information provided on the building’s energy and sustainability, which led to planning permission being granted.\"We have committed to providing a low carbon and sustainable nursery building in a - learning campus that supports the local community and provides a healthy and resilient natural environment for the future. This is in line with our Climate Change Strategy.“The development will offer learners, staff and the community all the benefits of moving from an older, much less energy-efficient building to a new, more sustainable, high-quality, purpose-built facility with multiple access routes to encourage sustainable travel.“The nursery building’s orientation within that campus of north  south is also very important. The main building access is orientated to the south from Old Haddington Road to allow ease of access for those with additional support needs, as well as addressing the close relationship to the main primary school building, of which the nursery is a part.“Energy efficiency has been considered carefully throughout the building’s design and specication and we aim to combine this with sustainable building practices and reduce emissions where possible throughout the construction.”The new nursery, which will have capacity for  children over two sessions, has an open-plan design, with a mezz- anine area and separate quiet room.The contract value of the nursery is £. million, with a further £, due to be spent on internal fittings.North of the site, a three-classroom extension for secondary-school pupils is being built on the south-west side of North Berwick High School.This £. million project, due to be completed next autumn, will house new home economics, modern languages and social studies classrooms for the high school."},{"url":null,"title":"fenton-barns-expand-new-proposals","story":"Two new storage and distribution buildings could be created at Fenton Barns under the proposals.DC Watson  Sonshas submitted plans to the council for a site to the west of the B.A design statement included with the planning application reads: “The applicant currently provides rental space for a number of tenants in the area, for running businessesand has provided opportunities for many employers over the years.“This development aims to accommodate further opportunities for other small businesses in East Lothian.”The applicant highlighted that there was “a substantial ongoing demand” for its existing premises.Currently, there are no vacant premises available at Fenton Barns, with the developer looking to change that."},{"url":null,"title":"lodge-street-office-turned-three-bedroom-home","story":"Proposals to change the use of the building on Haddington’s Lodge Street met with the approval of East Lothian Council.Haddington’s community council offered no opinion on the scheme by Macdonald Properties.Drawings included with the application show the two-storey building will feature two downstairs bedrooms, with a bedroom and livingroom created upstairs."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-covid-update-today-time-watch","story":"Final restrictions put in place in response to the Omicron iant sweeping across Scotland have been removed since Monday, January .In last week’s update the First Minister has confirmed that following the cabinets three-week review, the current Covid measures will not change.Changes were however announced for international travel.

In cases of the main Omicron iant, the S Gene is absent.“Encouragingly, there remains no evidence at this stage that the disease caused by this subtype is any more severe than that caused by the main Omicron iant.“Nor does it appear to be any more capable of evading the immunity conferred by either vaccination or prior infection.“However, there is evidence, from more than one country now, of a growth advantage for BA. compared to the main Omicron iant, which may mean it is more transmissible.”--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The Scottish Government is launching a new vaccination campaign targeted at  --year-olds to get their booster vaccine.From Friday, February , vaccinated travellers, who are fully vaccinated or under , will no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test and they will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival until theyve received a negative result.Travellers in this group will still need to take a test on or before day  after arriving in the UK -

There is a huge dference between an expat who decides to live abroad and the citizens of a part of the country that decides it wants to leave a union. Pensions are paid to us through the taxes collected from current taxpayers. There is no pot that can be shared between Scotland and rUK. Independence means just that – standing on your own two feet and living within your means. Those who seek independence sound like the flatmate who has moved out as they didn’t like you but still wants to come round to use the washing machine. The concept that another country would be responsible for paying pensions out of its current tax receipts is just farcical.As for goodwill on both sides, I have yet to see the SNP ever extend goodwill to the UK Government. Ian Blackford is testament to that. The ex-flatmate that is all nice when he wants something is going to learn the hard way.The SNP and separatists are yet again trying to get the citizens of Scotland to jump off a clf into the unknown. No thank you, I say.Jane Lax, Aberlour.THE BURDEN OF PROOFTHE joint contribution of The Herald and the Fraser of Allander Institute is to be welcomed in the debate on the future of Scottish pensions Letters, February   . We now have neutral confirmation that the UK state retirement pension scheme is a pay-as-you-go arrangement, with no accumulated personal or national pot and that it is a benefit rather than than an entitlement. In turn, we can now agree how those Scottish pensions will not be paid for .However, there is uncertainty as to how they would be paid for, even at the current rates, let alone the more generous levels promised by the SNP. It is incumbent on nationalists to tell us the who and how of the future funding of Scottish pensions. Hopefully, we will learn more in the much-touted independence prospectus now being prepared at great cost by the policy masterminds of the Scottish Government. Ever the optimist, I look forward to being convinced.Incidentally, the issue of pensions is a perfect example of why the burden of proof should always be with those who advocate change, in this case who support secession from the UK. We can see the current state retirement pension, how it is funded, how sustainable that funding is, what it will buy, what its relationship to private pensions is and so on. In contrast, we have no certainty at all about the arrangements in a putative independent Scotland, just lofty assurances and best-case scenarios, and there will none until we know how they will work in realistic and concrete terms.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.A DEAL WILL BE DONEMARK Smithquite rightly pointed out the irony in Ian Blackford and Nicola Sturgeon possibly \"doing a Boris\" regarding the state pension being paid by the UK Government on gaining independence. But his article seemed to be a personal worry that he may lose out financially given a breakaway. He needs to take on board that a Yes vote is not a vote for Nicola Sturgeon, or even a vote for the SNP, but a choice for self-determination. I believe that a deal will be done to honour the pension.Brian Higgins, Clydebank.* CAN someone please explain why the UK Government would continue to pay Scottish pensions after independence  I accept that the UK pays for expat Brits who live abroad as they are still British, but I cant see whyScotland gets independence why they would pay for the pension of foreign nationals, as every person living in Scotland will become a foreign national on day one of independence.Robert McCaskie, Biggar.GIVE US SOME CLARITYI AGREE with Barbara Jarvis . Last year one of George Galloways Alliance for Unitys policies was for the UK Government to pass a Canada-style Clarity Act to set out the terms of any referendum and subsequent treaty on issues such as national debt, trade, borders, citizenship and options for No-voting regions to remain in the UK.This would be negotiated before a referendum so voters would know what they were voting for.It was studiously ignored by all the mainstream parties. The argument over pensions is surely an example of the need for it,only to put the nationalist pipe dream – and Scotland – out of their misery.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HOME TRUTHS FOR STURGEONKEVIN McKenna’s articlewas pretty funny and despite being tongue in cheek offered some serious points. I fully agree with his suggestion that the FM should visit “one of Glasgow’s less salubrious arrondissements” for a photo shoot. May I suggest she visits Govanhill, possibly one of the least salubrious arrondissements in Western Europe  Oh, it’s in her own constituency, by the way.John Gilligan, Ayr.JOHNSON MUST APOLOGISETHE hounding of Labour’s leader by what can only be described as a baying mob on the streets of London was shameful .Cries about Jimmy Savile and Sir Keir Starmer’s part in the prosecution processcould be heard clearly on news clips. I am afraid Boris Johnson must accept his part in igniting this disgraceful behaviour and unconditionally apologise. When he taunted the Opposition leader in the way he did, it was tantamount to unleashing every crank and zealot in the UK.Does the PM not recall that very recently one of his own MPs was brutally stabbed to death by a zealot  And of course no-one has forgotten the Jo Cox atrocity. When someone in high office uses such language he or she risks giving carte blanche to the unstable and deluded.It is incumbent on all in public office to speak in measured language and remember what can resultthey do not. Mr Johnson may well be singing \"I will survive\" in the shower but it will not be for much longer unless he learns very quickly to hold his tongue.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.THE CASE FOR A WINDFALL TAXOIL giant BP has reported its highest profit for eight years, amounting to £. billion for , the highest for eight years. This comes days after Shell reported profits of more than £ billion for last year, both companies cashing in on rocketing oil and gas markets.Gas prices have increased five-fold from prior to the pandemic and oil prices have almost doubled as economies open up. This is leading to big increases in gas and electricity bills for households, which will face a record energy bill increase of  per cent from April after the regulator lted the cap on default tarfs to £,. The choice for many, pushed into fuel poverty, will now be between heating and eating.Facing crippling increases in the cost of living, it is interesting to note what other countries are doing to tackle this energy crisis. France, for example, is capping bill increases at four per cent Norway is paying half of its citizen’s energy bills with profits from its lucrative oil fund, and Germany is looking to cap increases at five per cent.The pockets of the oil companies are deep, having profited from higher wholesale prices, and a one-off windfall tax here in the UK on fossil fuel giants helping hard-pressed households cope with record energy bills is urgently required.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.* WILLIE Macleanstates that when it comes to the treatment of North Sea oil, the crucial dference between Norway and Scotland is that the former is independent, whereas Scotland is not, being subject at the time to the UKs efforts to conceal the full potential economic benefits. The implication is, thatwe had been independent, then we could have followed Norways course.Forgive me for not sharing his rosy view, in light of the fact that with the benefit of  years hindsight, the SNP Government felt able to sell off seabed plots for offshore wind projects for what most experts deem to be a pittance.R Murray, Glasgow.Read more: Stop causing needless alarm to the elderly over pensions"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13456167.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-look-inside-glasgows-burrell-collection-69m-revamp","story":"Along with his we, Constance, Lady Burrell, shipping magnate Sir William Burrell amassed one of the world’s greatest personal art collections.It was renowned for its quality of Chinese art, exquisite stained glass, intricate tapestries as well as its breadth of fine art.Read more: Glasgows Burrell Collection reveals public reopening dateAnd when Sir William decided he would donate his collection, Glasgow fought to give it a home in the city.Now, almost  years after the Burrell Collection opened its doors for the first time in the stunning grounds of Pollok Country Park, it is entering a new chapter in its history.

As a refuge, as for many people that’s what these places are, it is a place of hope because you can see that in the collections and the stories and it is a place of inspiration,\" she said.\"You just have to have met some of the children who have been helping shape some of the interpretation giving us ideas on what works and what doesn’t, we have had , local people involved in this. They have been honest, as only children can be, saying what’s good, what works. You will have an amazing experience here. It is a huge public space but filled with so much to see to stir the imagination and the heart.\"The £m refurbishment of the Burrell Collection is now complete The Burrell is a museum which has had to fight for the affection of the city, but its hoped this tide may now turn.Dr McConnell added: \"I think the beauty of Glasgow’s museums is people feel ownership of them. However, while the case was sadly in this museum that not all local people felt that, we have done a lot of work in the past five years, with school groups in particular, now let anyone tell them this isn’t their collection.\"Funding for the £m project has come from several bodies including the UK and Scottish governments and how the citys treasures are funded in the future something which Dr McConnell believes could change.\"I think there is case for why we should fund museums like this in a time when the economy has been hit so hard as a result of Covid and so many people need new investment in social care and education, but this is as important. This speaks to what makes us all human.\"When we are planning for a society that nurtures people and let’s them reach their potential, you need places like this because it is so important about giving that place where you can reflect you can understand the rest of the world.

Dr McConnell added: \"The current funding models, particularly here in Glasgow where we are seeing a local council with some of the biggest challenges but are also expected to fund nationally signicant resources, that needs a rethink. Certainly the Scottish Government and the UK government have given very generously to this project, contributing to the capital programme but more recently the UK government have given us money towards the revenue and whilst it is time limited I hope they will feel that the benefits they get from that will compel them to continue to fund and we are also talking to the Scottish Government about exactly the same thing.\"One visitor given a sneak preview thankfully wasnt reduced to tears this time as she was  years ago.In  Janice Layden made the Queen laugh by refusing to hand over flowers she was supposed to present to Her Majesty.The -year-old was among the guests of honour yesterday, and said:“It’s beautul, and even though it has changed a lot, it still feels like the Burrell.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-235-todays-wordle-february-9-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.Play Wordle here.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter H and ends with the letter R.The spelling of the word might throw you as this version is mainly used in America.It is another word for funny.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

From the wartime parents who despaired of their s teenagers to Baby Boomers who wonder aloud about the behaviour of Millennials and Gen Z, dfering views and priorities will continue to ide the generations.  However, one thing that people of virtually every age can agree upon is that the direction of climate change is indisputable – andwe don’t accelerate our current attempts to tackle it then the consequences are going to be severe. Understanding the challenges is crucial.Those who will have to live longest with it are primarily Generations X, Y and Z – and their children, in what is now called Generation Alpha. These are people born between  and the mid-s. However, Baby Boomers also have a dog in this fight – for it is their grandchildren and great grandchildren who will live with the consequences of the actions we take in the next few years.And those actions must ramp-up drasticallywe are to have any chance of success. After the despair of the last few years of the pandemic it is now time for a ‘Great Acceleration’ of words and deeds.With that in mind, a number of Scottish organisations have come together to develop the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. The Royal Scottish Geographical Society, the Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and online educational Jump Digital have created this new, world-leading project. Describing the thinking behind the concept, Mike Robinson, Chief Executive of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, said: “The curriculum as currently framed is wholly inadequate in covering the climate crisis, so it is not surprising that we are hearing from students themselves, wanting to learn more about the climate emergency. “Now and in the future, today’s young people will be driving much of the change required, so its vital we give them a solid foundation on which to build, as much in preparation for the world of work as for the protection of our planet.  The more we all understand the solutions, the sooner we can all start ensuring they happen.”The result of this collective endeavour is believed to be a world first a customised award which was created by Jump Digital and jointly badged with SQA who will certy successful candidates.It can be delivered to people of all ages and abilities in both the education and private sector fields.Derek Houston, Regional Manager at the Scottish Qualications Authority: “SQA is delighted to be one of the partners involved in the development of this unit, which will equip candidates with an understanding of the science behind climate change and of solutions that exist to help tackle environmental deterioration.”Jump Digital’s initial Schools Pilot Programme was road-tested by all S and S pupils and  members of staff at Lochside Academy, Aberdeen.  The feedback from Lochside has now been fine-tuned into the schools’ version of the CSA, which gives school pupils the environmental knowledge and skills that can improve their employability in what is, and will likely remain, a challenging jobs market. Neil Hendry, the former Head Teacher at Lochside Academy was enthusiastic about the impact of the course.He said:“Following a two-day induction programme for the key teachers and School Senior Management Team, our senior students completed the course on theirto school. It was very well received by staff and students, and I was subsequently very impressed by the willingness of Jump Digital to listen to – and make good use of – the feedback we provided.”Alongside the development of the core course materials, Jump Digital recognised the importance of ensuring that teachers and career advisers also have the necessary knowledge to guide students through the course and help them understand its value in the job market.Consequently, a Teachers Pack was produced, and ‘Meet the Expert’ webinars developed, where pupils and teachers can ask questions of industry thought-leaders. The next phase will see the Schools CS Accelerator being rolled out to over , pupils in the north-east of Scotlandas part of  Scottish Government’s £.million of funding to the North East Economic Recovery and Skills Fund.  In response to the successful trials and roll-out, Robert Fleeting of Jump Digital said: “Tackling the climate emergency is likely to shape the future careers of so many of our young people, so improving their understanding of the issue at an early stage is essential.”  Allison Carrington, Regional Skills Planning Lead at Skills Development Scotlandfor the north-east and working with partners to deliver the NEERSF, said: “It is satisfying to see so much progress being made with this innovative programme and the upcoming roll-out will now see up to , pupils across the north-east of Scotland benefit from its value and relevance in terms of developing employability skills.“SDS is supporting the ersication of the regional economy and the drive to net zero by delivering activity focusing on supporting a range of learners – including school pupils – to gain digital skills which will help them articulate into further learning or into employment in digital technology.”Newsquest Scotland commercial director David Ward said: “The Herald is proud to be involved with the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. It is vital that we not only equip Scotlands young people with an academic appreciation of the climate emergency, but also give them a real, practical understanding of the solutions that exist. The CSA course provides a one-stop solution which informs, inspires and motivates all who participate.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13377621.jpg?type=article-full","title":"get-5-odeon-tickets-25-start-march","story":"Tickets for theatres can be quite expensive, butyou plan to go to Odeon there is a discount available.Groupon is currently offering two tickets for £, or  you want to get a group together, you can get five tickets for £.The discount on tickets will not valid for Odeon Luxe cinemas however.If you want to go to one of Odeons Luxe cinemas a deal is still available at Groupon with two tickets for £ and five for £.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Odeon tickets are available in bundles at Groupon \" class\"editor-image\"Odeon tickets are available in bundles at GrouponThe tickets are available nationwide in  participating Odeon locations and theres no booking fee.Shoppers have got until March ,  to claim their bargain cinema ticket, and it can only be redeemed online on the Odeon website.The fine print states that there is a purchase limit of two or five per person, and the voucher is only valid for standard D screenings.Currently , plus people have already made use of the five tickets for £ deal, whilst over , plus have gone for the two tickets for £ deal.If you fancy adding to that tally, you can go to the Groupon website here to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole.

And David said, ‘Well, you’re a golfer, and golf has never been hotter and booming, and this is what you’re going to do. I think it’s time you turn pro and move on.’“I still remember that phone call like it was yesterday.”Woods had recently won the US Open at Pebble Beach by  shots when Howell turned professional in July , the first of four consecutive major championship victories which made up the ‘Tiger Slam’.“Looking back now, having played golf in the Tiger Woods, and I’m going to call it the Phil Mickelson era too, was incredible,” Howell added. vw,vw,px, px\"Tiger Woods holds the Claret Jug aloft after winning the  Open Championship at St Andrews “I’m quite sure that the Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Gary Player era was also special, but to play in the Tiger era with what he did for television and the exposure of it, I mean he gave me a job.

I am grateful to all of those stakeholders who have helped shape this updated guidance.”Mark Tufnell, president of the Country, Land and Business Association, said: “The Code now offers landowner-specic advice which will be particularly helpful for our members, equipping them with the tools and knowledge to smoothly manage increased public interest in accessing green spaces.“Rather than pitting rural communities and visitors against each other, the guidance unites them by focusing on a shared appreciation of our countryside.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of . A documentary on the band is also due to be aired on BBC Alba soon."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mating-male-and-female-adders-Vipera-berus.-©Lorne-GillNatureScot-1-scaled.jpg","title":"tobar an dualchais brides day the birthday of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine or ‘the dead month’.   or Saint Bride’s Day. This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Only -% of schools’ spending is on keeping the schools open, paying bills and energy costs, never mind meeting the needs of our children.”Mr Gault said it was “incredible that schools have maintained such high levels of delivery for our children”.“Even with their greatest endeavours, however, we have seen how far short our system has fallen in relation to our most vulnerable children and our children with additional needs,” he added.“Many of our politicians have expressed their view that education is of paramount priority and schools are central to the health, wellbeing and development of our children, communities and wider society.“I find it very hard to marry these sentiments with the actual political delivery for education.”Responding to a question from SDLP MLA Colin McGrath about the impact on schools of the budget, Ms McIlveen said: “A - baseline of £,.m plus an extra £m and £mfor Holiday Hunger has been proposed to my department in the draft - budget.“While I welcome the additional funding allocation, it is wholly insufficient to address the signicant pressures.“It would leave estimated unmet pressures of £m, £m and £m respectively over the next three years.“If there is not a signicant change by final budget stage, I anticipate that some very dficult decisions will have to be made, which could have serious consequences for front line education services, resulting in a detrimental impact on the futures of our children and young people.“Given that the draft budget is still out for consultation, detailed budgetary planning has not yet been undertaken and therefore no decisions have yet been taken in relation to future years’ budgets.”Related topicsMichelle McIlveenMore On Michelle McIlveenSex education should be part of ‘mandatory curriculum’ to tackle violence against women, claims NI children’s commissioner‘Unfit for purpose’: MLAs hit out over sex education in NI schools PremiumMark BainOpinionIntegrated education remains Rubik’s cube conundrum for NI PremiumMark BainOpinionLessons to be learned from rare agreement on school starting ageSchool Covid absences not as bad as feared, says Education MinisterMost ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Eight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police OmbudsmanLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them back‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest EducationMark BainOpinionWe’re in uncharted waters and thousands of pupils are at risk of being cast further adrtStormont pushes ahead with law to give parents an option to defer school starting agePositive Covid cases in NI schools still risingCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Don’t write us off: The rural communities battling to save their schoolsLatestRalf Rangnick delivers Champions League warning after latest Man Utd setbackThe four new faces in England’s Test squad for next month’s tour of West IndiesOlivia Munn ‘felt like body was failing’ during breastfeeding struggleSweden ends Covid testing as pandemic restrictions ltedDavid Healy hits back at ‘kne-sharpening’ Linfield critics after win over Larne sends Blues to the top of the Irish League table,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The accused is further alleged to have assaulted two people and allegedly made a threat to damage windows at an address at Drummond Court.The charges relate to October , . The defendant has been in custody since October after being unable to make bail.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up She appeared at court via a video link from prison.A defence lawyer said the case allegedly involved “waving an imitation firearm at a neighbour in a street and then there is a small amount of cannabis growing in her house”.That case was adjourned to February .Regarding the defendant’s dog and  fish the defence lawyer said a Council had made an application for a “Disposal Order”.He said the defendant “does not consent” to the Order.District Judge Nigel Broderick asked who was looking after the dog and  fish while the defendant is in custody and the defence lawyer said: “I believe it is the Council”.A legal representative for a local Council told the court to date it had cost around £, to look after the animals — £ for the dog and £ for the fish per day.The judge asked: “What sort of fish are we talking about ”The Council lawyer said she was not sure.Judge Broderick said: “I hope it is not goldfish”.The Council lawyer said the fish were in a “filtered tank” and added: “I don’t think they’re goldfish.”The judge added: “It costs £ a day to look after  fish in a tank of water. I find that very hard to understand”.The judge said it was a “struggle” for him to understand the cost, adding: “The dog yes but the fish, really  It seems exorbitant to me but that is just my preliminary view.”The judge wanted to know on what basis the council was making the application and askedthere had been a conviction regarding the animals.The council lawyer said: “No, there hasn’t been a conviction or a decision on prosecution in the matter yet. The Council were contacted by police on the date of Ms Martin’s arrest and advised that animals were in the property.“Once they had ensured that the property was not being accessed by anyone  and the animals not being looked after the animals were therefore seized.“Given that Ms Martin has remained in custody since October we haven’t had any approach from anyone willing to assist in the care of the animals so the Council has had to remain their custodian.”The court heard the dispute about the application will have to be fixed for a hearing.The council lawyer said a council officer and a vet would give evidence.That case was adjourned to March .Most ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Eight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandBelfast artist tells of delight that Duchess of Cambridge will read book he illustrated on CBeebiesLinfield - Larne: Christy Manzinga pounces to fire Blues back to the summit ahead of intriguing Big Two battlePSNI investigating arson attack at flat in NewtownabbeySister of Belfast star Ciaran Hinds laughs off Oscars name mispronunciation as she pays tribute to Kenneth BranaghDavid McAllister bags a brace to get new boss Matthew Tipton off to the perfect start at ArdsLatestGCSE critics do not understand value of exams, says GoveNewcastle’s Labour leader loses vote to stand in May electionsCarex owner sees sales ease off as pandemic demand slowsJamison Gibson-Park’s ‘whoosh’ ability can help Ireland to Six Nations win in France, says Colin PattersonBelfast artist tells of delight that Duchess of Cambridge will read book he illustrated on CBeebies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe umbrella group representing the views of the UDA, UVF and Red Hand Commando has called on the UUP to “start acting like unionists” over the Brexit protocol.The Loyalist Communities Council makes the call in a letter in today’s Belfast , with the LCC’s David Campbell, a former Ulster Unionist chairman, claiming the party needs to decideit is “actually opposing the protocol”.It comes after the first meeting of the Assembly since Paul Givan’s resignation as First Minister last week sparked a fresh political crisis at Stormont.UUP leader Doug Beattie said that while he disagreed with the DUP’s actions, the protocol had benefited some firms, while hampering others.He said: “The protocol has created a feast and a famine.“And the feast is, some businesses are doing very well out of the protocol but there is a famine, and that is some of our businesses are absolutely on their knees.“So, therefore, we have to fix that. We will only fix that by speaking to the UK Government and to the EU, to get them to understand that feast or famine, to fix the problems that we’ve got.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up All other parties bar the TUV have criticised the DUP’s move, in particular as it means victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse will not receive the planned formal apology from the First and Deputy First Ministers.Sinn Fein’s former Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The DUP’s actions in unilaterally resigning from the Executive are reckless and they’ve caused concern and uncertainty for businesses, for workers, for families and campaigners on a range of many important issues.“In terms of the victims of historical institutional abuse, it has caused real hurt and trauma.“And while the DUP must bear responsibility for that, I’m also very conscious that those of us who are serious about showing responsible leadership and delivering for people can and should seek to salvage what we can from the chaos the DUP have caused.”DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was surprised other parties couldn’t see the role they played in the First Minister’s resignation.“Because we had a debate in this chamber some time ago when the SDLP, Sinn Fein, Alliance and Green Party all called for the rigorous implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he added.“Now, we got a report from the EU Commission some weeks ago that was put in the Assembly library, which indicates what the rigorous implementation of the protocol is. That for some years those people who would be travelling back from ious parts of the world through Aldergrove Airport would have seen a notice about bringing food in, or anything from third countries, what they’re supposed to do.“And the EU are expecting us to do that on food coming in from Britain. Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Eight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandBelfast artist tells of delight that Duchess of Cambridge will read book he illustrated on CBeebiesLinfield - Larne: Christy Manzinga pounces to fire Blues back to the summit ahead of intriguing Big Two battlePSNI investigating arson attack at flat in NewtownabbeySister of Belfast star Ciaran Hinds laughs off Oscars name mispronunciation as she pays tribute to Kenneth BranaghDavid McAllister bags a brace to get new boss Matthew Tipton off to the perfect start at ArdsLatestCharles Howell III pays tribute to Tiger Woods ahead of PGA Tour milestoneGCSE critics do not understand value of exams, says GoveNewcastle’s Labour leader loses vote to stand in May electionsCarex owner sees sales ease off as pandemic demand slowsJamison Gibson-Park’s ‘whoosh’ ability can help Ireland to Six Nations win in France, says Colin Patterson,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And while this semi-autobiographical film is about the Troubles and the effect it had on the people who lived here, it#s also about how le went on regardless and people tried to make the best of things - going to school, visiting grandparents, worrying about brown envelopes - in one of the most authentic aspects of the film.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The telling of the story through the eyes of Buddy, an innocent child, adds crucial objectivity and a view of things through the eyes of someone without the cynicism of adults or the need to weigh up the options like his parents. Instead, he#s more worried about his fondness for his classmate and how whatever turn his le takes may affect her and their relationship.Buddy#s grandfather, played by the inimitable Ciaran Hinds, listens to him talk about his crush and schools him on the topic of love while Pa, played by Jamie Dornan, has to listen to a local heavyweight who threatens the family#s safety. later, Buddy worries thatthe family moves away, his accent won#t be understood. He is assured: If they can#t understand you, then they#re not listening.It#s a wider point, made to ying degrees throughout the film, about how best to relate to each other and while not the whole picture, plays into the broad brush subjectivity that means Belfast can be enjoyed by all.Read MoreBelfast: Branagh’s ode to city goes up against western hit The Power Of The Dog at the OscarsWill it be seventh heaven for Branagh this time at Oscars Most ReadLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Eight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police Ombudsman‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandBelfast artist tells of delight that Duchess of Cambridge will read book he illustrated on CBeebiesLinfield - Larne: Christy Manzinga pounces to fire Blues back to the summit ahead of intriguing Big Two battlePSNI investigating arson attack at flat in NewtownabbeySister of Belfast star Ciaran Hinds laughs off Oscars name mispronunciation as she pays tribute to Kenneth BranaghDavid McAllister bags a brace to get new boss Matthew Tipton off to the perfect start at ArdsLatestCharles Howell III pays tribute to Tiger Woods ahead of PGA Tour milestoneGCSE critics do not understand value of exams, says GoveNewcastle’s Labour leader loses vote to stand in May electionsCarex owner sees sales ease off as pandemic demand slowsJamison Gibson-Park’s ‘whoosh’ ability can help Ireland to Six Nations win in France, says Colin Patterson,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a minority, based on these numbers.“If he is concerned that there appear to be more Catholic academics than Protestant academics he should simply say so.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive

fact be more Protestant academics than Catholic academics, with a disproportionate percentage of the former choosing not to disclose it.”A Protestant academic at the university, who didn’t wish to be named, said they hoped students or anyone reading their research “would have no idea of my community background or political beliefs, because I take my professionalism very seriously”.“If it felt like a cold house for Protestants, I think things would be dferent,” they added.“But, to me, it seems to be a non-issue politicised for reasons other than a genuine concern for inclusivity in the workplace.”The academic also believes Queen’s to be “one of the most international employers in Northern Ireland”.According to the university’s website, it currently employs nearly  staff from over  countries “in a iety of jobs”.“Because that is so important to the make-up of staff, the Catholic Protestant dimension is just a bit more complicated than I felt was being reflected initially by those numbers,” the academic added.Marie Coleman, a historian at Queen’s, noted that with an Assembly election in the offing, “sectarian head-counting has started” and ponderedthere will be “any supposedly definitive opinion polls where % are undecided” on who to vote for. “Maybe one day I’ll wake up to a newspaper headline where local politicians praise the contribution QUB makes to our society,” she tweeted.It is a legal requirement under the Equality Commission,for all registered employers here to monitor and keep a record of their workforce’s sex and community background .The figures show the university has  staff from a “non-determined” background,  from a Protestant background and  from a Catholic background.QUB said it was “an equal opportunities employer and is entirely committed to issues relating to equality, ersity and inclusion”.Related topicsPeter WeirMore On Peter Weir PremiumLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for

This wasn’t a police investigation,” he said. “But the RUC is not in a position to defend itself. The organisation is tied up, hooded and open to taking battering after battering.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Negative publicity is what republicans have been superb at, deflecting reality and piece by piece building up the RUC as the ‘bad guys’.“London is not interested, and as there are no prosecutions they are happy to sit back and allow the RUC to be tarnished. Officers are being let down.”A lot of former officers have now given up trying to defend themselves. They are always on the defensive but when the Ombudsman leaps on a bungee cord into the past that does not mean there is any sense of the realities of what the RUC were facing.”DUP South Antrim MLA and Policing Board member Trevor Clarke warned that the record of the entire RUC is at risk of being “unfairly tarnished” by sweeping allegations of collusion.“This is the latest in a growing list of reports by the Ombudsman which alleges collusive behaviour against police officers during the Troubles despite the fact that no such criminal offence actually exists,” he said.“Tellingly the report makes no recommendations in terms of criminal proceedings and accepts that the RUC has no prior knowledge of the attacks.“The courts previously ruled that the Police Ombudsman has no remit to adjudicate on claims of criminality or misconduct. Now it seems PONI has found a loophole by examining allegations of collusion against the description of collusion put forward by families rather than any legal definition.“This trend will frustrate many retired officers.

I am grateful to all of those stakeholders who have helped shape this updated guidance.”Mark Tufnell, president of the Country, Land and Business Association, said: “The Code now offers landowner-specic advice which will be particularly helpful for our members, equipping them with the tools and knowledge to smoothly manage increased public interest in accessing green spaces.“Rather than pitting rural communities and visitors against each other, the guidance unites them by focusing on a shared appreciation of our countryside.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building.

Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I strongly recommend that the author of the editorial reads the -page Amnesty report. It was developed through four years of rigorous and extensive research on laws, policies and practices, where we have documented in detail how Israeli authorities treat Palestinians as an inferior racial group and systematically deprive them of their rights.It documents how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, the forcible transfer of Palestinian people from their land, drastic restrictions on movement, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system amounting to apartheid.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Apartheid is defined under international law. No two systems of oppression and domination will ever be identical, and the treatment does not need to be identical to that experienced historically in South Africa. Indeed, Amnesty has previously found that the Myanmar government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid. Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity. When a crime against humanity is committed, the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.Crucially, Israeli law treats Palestinians as an inferior and separate group defined by their racialised non-Jewish, Arab status.We conclude that this apartheid system is enforced against all Palestinians living under the effective control of Israel – whether in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, or in other countries as refugees.Amnesty recognises that Jewish people, like Palestinians, claim a right to self-determination and does not challenge Israel’s desire to be a home for Jewish people. However, international law does prohibit Israel from discriminating against Palestinians and others who already live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunication, and against Palestinian refugees who have a right toto the country.Like all countries, Israel has the right - and indeed an obligation under international law - to protect all people under its control. However, security-related policies must still comply with international law, and they must be proportionate to the threat posed. Security can never be a justication or pretext for human rights violations and crimes against humanity. Though not the subject of this report, Amnesty has consistently documented serious violations by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. We have consistently reported on and condemned unlawful attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israeli civilians. This includes the firing of indiscriminate rockets from Gaza into Israel, which we have called for the International Criminal Court to investigate as war crimes. The state of Israel has been a member of the United Nations since its establishment in . It is a party to international human rights conventions and other treaties and therefore must respect these obligations, including by upholding the right to equality and non-discrimination, and by ending and remedying violations of international law. This report is a call for the Israeli government to do so and thus end its system of apartheid against Palestinians.Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland Programme Director, Amnesty International UKAmnesty International calling Israel an apartheid state is an unjust slur——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey crossed the busy A and followed a track for the slippery descent where the old set of steps have finally disintegrated and through bare autumnal woodland onto part of the Ridgeway Golf Club, where the ground was glistening white with a thick carpet of overnight frost. After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors.

Picture: PA The Six Nations Championship comes around once a year seeing international sides of France, England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales each going head-to-head.Every team will play each of the other teams once throughout the competition adding up to a total of  matches.Home advantage alternates each season so, for example,England played Scotland at home last year, they will be away this year.The Championship generally commences in February, coming to a conclusion at the end of March.: Six Nations referees  - meet the refs assigned to every gameTeams are awarded bonus points for scoring four or more tries in a game. Picture: PA The winning team will be awarded four points. Any winning team scoring four tries or more in any game, an additional bonus point will be awarded.The losing side gets no points but can achieve bonus match points. If a team scores four tries or more or loses by a margin of seven points or fewer they will be awarded one point. If the losing side scores four tries or more and loses by a margin of seven points or fewer, they will be awarded two points.Unions that draw a Match shall each be awarded two Match Points and any of them that scores four tries or more in the process shall be awarded a further one Match Point.For a draw, two match points will be awarded to each side, howevereither team scores four tries or more during the game, they will achieve a further one bonus point.More points are up for grabs for any team winning all five of its games. Known as a “Grand Slam” the team will be awarded a further three bonus points..removeSix Nations: The TableIn the event of a draw, points scored and conceeded and number of tries comes into play.

This railway line has been in dire need of an upgrade for many years and anytime we appeared close to making some new obstacle would present itself to get in the way of this vital work.“Since becoming Minister, Nichola Mallon has been determined to deliver for people right across the North and thanks to her hard work we are now closer than ever to seeing this key infrastructure project being realised. Many people travel this route every day to commute to work, university, to socialise and visit friends and family and when it’s delivered it will make a huge dference to the lives of local people.“It will also have huge benefits in our fight to tackle the climate crisis. By making it easier for people to choose to leave their own vehicles at home and use public transport it will reduce congestion and the harmful emissions that many of our vehicles produce.“The lack of modern public transport facilities and dedicated infrastructure is often cited as one of the reasons by major businesses that they are unable to commit to investing in East Derry and the wider North West. Improvements like this will be key as we work to see our towns and cities realise their potential.“While other parties seek to collapse the Executive when they don’t get their own way or call for an early election despite much work still needing to be done, SDLP Minister Mallon gets on with the job and even in the midst of instability delivers projects like this to make le better for our communities.”Read More Read MoreNeed for Translink shuttle to Dungiven park and rideCara HunterNichola MallonColeraineSDLPImprovements  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsAccelerant poured over the front door of a flat in Newtownab...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...News£, investment at Glenshane junction a ‘game changer’...NewsMost PopularValentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest sofa beds UK : the most comfortable sofas that conv...RecommendedBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, S...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBest dog beds : stylish, comfortable dog beds for all ki...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He was also a much loved uncle, grandfather and great grandfather.He lived for his family and worked day and night to provide for them. Family meant everything to him and he would go out of his way to help, care and look after them.He was a man who asked for so little but he gave so very much.He was such a selfless man, always thinking of others. His family said: “He’d give you the last bite out of his mouth.”He was also one of Manchester United’s most avid supporters and never missed a match on TV.As well as football, he had a great love for the Orange Order and Royal Black Institution. Indeed in the mid s he was a Worshipful Master for Lisavague LOL No where he was a member for many years.He lived for the July break and always attended the Twelfth and Scarva.Later in le he transferred to the Ex-Servicemen’s Lodge.When the time came that he was no longer able to parade on foot with them, he drove himself and other ex-servicemen with him in the parade, following his much-loved flute band Portadown True Blues with much pride.This year Corcrain Bonfire has lost one of its greatest assets, but his legacy will remain with all the bonfire crew. This year’s bonfire will be dedicated to him.Big Bert was also Corcrain’s best loved taxi driver, easily recognised by his big bright smile and big white ‘fun bus’. He always took so much pride in his appearance and was always well dressed. You could smell his aftershave from miles away and he always had a smile on his face.However his bright smile left forever the day his soul mate passed away. A piece of him died with her.His family said: “The only thing that we can take comfort in is the fact that they are reunited once again and they will both be smiling down on us from heaven. Our loss is their reunion.”A funeral service for Mr JamesPurdy, late of Selshion Parade, Portadown was held on January  outside the family home followed by committal in Kernan Cemetery.PortadownBilly  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsAccelerant poured over the front door of a flat in Newtownab...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...News£, investment at Glenshane junction a ‘game changer’...NewsMost PopularValentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest sofa beds UK : the most comfortable sofas that conv...RecommendedBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, S...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...RecommendedBest dog beds : stylish, comfortable dog beds for all ki...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back. His comments come astwo Covid--related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday.Another , cases of coronavirus were also reported, up from , on Sunday.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbdccaee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccbbbce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644335284942.jpg--covid_19___tue_8th_february_figures.jpg?164433528400","title":"covid  tue th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
