The subject of books, documentaries and endless tributes, he is almost bigger in death than he was in life.As GQ Editor Dylan Jones, the author of one of these books, says, Bowie is a ‘continually expanding balloon that refuses to burst’.All of which makes the recollection of Bowie as a middle-aged seducer of teenage groupies, shared via a podcast by comedian David Baddiel, feel wildly jarring.Baddiel said last weekend that he was told the story by one of his female friends about a ‘romance’ with Bowie while the singer and Mick Jagger were holidaying in Mustique. He said: ‘This woman was 16 at the time and Bowie would have been in his 40s.She and her best friend had one of many drinking nights with Bowie and ended up back at their shack with David.‘David was clearly keen on a threesome and had put some work in to create it. The way he did this, according to her, was to take all his clothes off and put Let’s Dance on cassette and dance naked.‘It worked for David as both the girls got naked. There were sexual goings-on but she didn’t sleep with David. I said: “Why on earth would you not want to lose your virginity to David Bowie?” She replied: “It wouldn’t mean anything to him. I didn’t want to do that for him, just one night.”          Bowie was said to have slept with a 16-year-old girl while on holiday in the Caribbean island of Mustique‘Instead she went outside. David did s*** the friend, then came out and tried to make it all right with her because she was a bit p***** off.’Bowie fans already knew about the wild times in the early Seventies — to be clear, it’s not illegal to sleep with a 16-year-old — but was he really in the habit of seducing teenagers when he was middle aged?It appears so. Put simply, Bowie was described by his friends as a ‘sex addict’ with a catalogue of lovers old and young, male and female, and a tremendous appetite for all.This week, the Mail has spoken to two women who were under the age of consent when they slept with Bowie. Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15, explained: ‘I never thought of David Bowie as a paedophile. He would f**k anything. If he liked it he would f**k it.’          Lori Mattix, who had a liaison with him aged 15Early girlfriend Dana Gillespie concurred, telling me: ‘As far as sex went, if it moved, he was there. Man, woman, old or young. Times have changed and it doesn’t always look so good in black and white now, but in those days we were just having fun there were no rules.’It’s a matter of record that he dallied with famous women including Charlie Chaplin’s widow Oona, 22 years older, and actress Bette Midler, plus Bianca Jagger, Susan Sarandon and Lulu.There were always rumours of some kind of liaison with his friend and friendly rival Mick Jagger, and he also had affairs with male mime artist Lindsay Kemp and Natasha Korniloff, Kemp’s costume designer — at the same time. Finding out he was two-timing them, both attempted suicide.Sometimes, having sex was a way of gain an advantage. Former wife Angie said: ‘Using sex was what David did. He used sex to endear himself to people, so they loved him and did things for him and worked hard to promote him. It was the pure selfishness of wanting to succeed.’But at other times, his promiscuity seemed more simply a habit which he enjoyed too much to consider amending.As he said in a 1997 radio interview: ‘I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible promiscuous time.’The sexual free-for-all characterised his open marriage to Angie, whom he wed in 1970. She wrote in her autobiography: ‘David made a virtual religion of slipping the lance of love into almost everyone around him.’ Some lovers they shared, others they did not. By his 1972 tour of America he was with Cyrinda Foxe, a 19-year-old model. She recalled that he sent for her while he was having sex with a groupie because he needed someone to talk to. Former assistant Tony Zanetta said David had sex with Puerto Rican transsexuals while in New York.

After the set he came up behind her and brushed her hair, and then asked if he could come home with her (she later worked out that this was because he was going to miss the last train back to Bromley.)They made love. She was 14, and he was 17.Dana told me: ‘I have never thought of David as someone who liked young girls in particular. He liked bright women.‘It has been suggested to me that him sleeping with me when I was 14 was “statutory rape” but I have said to writers, look, you can’t put that in because, yes, I was young but we were just having fun.‘He would play my guitar and listen to my songs, and play me his. I remember he once phoned me up to tell me that he had just written Space Oddity. He wrote the song Andy Warhol for me.‘We were friends for the first ten years of his career, I didn’t see him really after 1975. I wouldn’t call myself a girlfriend, we did all of that and got it out of our system.‘It was not the kind of relationship where I would ever have wanted to be Mrs Bowie.‘When I was 15 or 16 I would hear from him every three or four months. He would come round and I would cook him brown rice and vegetables because he wasn’t eating properly. I remember once he came round and said that his heart was a bit broken because he had trouble with Hermione (Farthingale, his ballet dancer girlfriend.)‘He did not talk about the emotional stuff, I guess you could say that he was a rather cold character because everything came second to ambition.’As David became more famous, he caught the attention of the notorious ‘baby groupies’ who were on the scene in Los Angeles at the time.Led by Californian wild child Sable Starr, who had a romance with Iggy Pop when she was 13, the girls competed to bed visiting British stars.One of their number was Lori Maddox, also known as Lori Mattix. She was 14 when she first met Bowie at the E Club on Sunset Strip and was working as a model. He was on his Spiders From Mars tour of 1972.She turned him down that night, but five months later Bowie returned to LA and she was called by his bodyguard, Stuey.She and friend Sable Starr went for dinner with Bowie at the Rainbow Bar \u0026amp Grill, and then back to his suite at the Beverly Hilton. Lori recalls that Bowie walked her through to the bathroom, stripped off his kimono and climbed into the tub with her. Then she says, he took her virginity. Later she had her first threesome, with Bowie and Sable (who died aged only 51). Lori was 15.Now she reflects on the episode with satisfaction. She said this week: ‘I don’t even think he thought about my age, he was so anti-social and breaking boundaries everywhere.‘I don’t think it was a thought for him and I don’t think he was hanging out with a lot of underage people. We were young then and he was 25, that is still young as well.‘The rockers must have known we were underage girls, maybe that was part of it for them, the innocence, I don’t know.    David Bowie married supermodel Iman in a private ceremony in Switzerland back in 1992‘David was so gentle and kind with me when we were together. It could have been some creepy guy who threw me on the bed and like raped me. It was a different thing, he took me by the hand and was a gentleman. He was a fascinating creature. Was I supposed to do it with some Algebra teacher in the back of his van? I was the last of the virgins at my school, too.‘Do I regret it? No, life goes on. I am 60 years old and it was 45 years ago. People should get over it. You go through a journey in life, I don’t believe in mistakes, I believe there is a destiny for everybody.‘David was not a star yet so he did not take advantage of any celebrity with me. I remained friends with him throughout his rise to fame and he would always check in with me to see how I was doing in my life. We were friends.‘I was a teen model. David was very androgynous and he liked to be around cool and interesting looking people. It was all pure fun. It was a different time in rock ’n’ roll. We did not have internet or cell phones or anything like that.‘He was attracted to that glam rock scene out here where we were all cheating and being unacceptable. It was all good, pure fun. I do not feel like I was taken advantage of, not at all. We were all just hanging out.’ She added: ‘He was fascinating for anybody. David was an anomaly, he was just not normal. He had carrot red hair, no eyebrows, he was magnificently beautiful, the skin, the cheekbones, those two different coloured eyes.

Race, a former hard-Left MP who’d transformed himself into a successful financial consultant, had been summoned by Claudia as a mutual friend to solve their differences.The papers in front of him showed that the Corbyns owed their bank £30,000, the equivalent of twice that figure today. Several personal loans had been guaranteed by Corbyn’s income as an MP – and he was also burdened by high mortgage repayments.As a last resort, the bank could threaten to recover its money by seizing his home. ‘You’ve run out of loans,’ said Race. Unchecked, within five years the debts would be £100,000. Corbyn’s annual salary was £43,000. Claudia interrupted. This was entirely the result of her husband’s folly, she said. She and their three young sons – Sebastian, Benjamin and Thomas – had little money even to buy food and clothes. ‘We can’t afford a decent life.’The principal cause of the debts was the Red Rose Community Centre in Holloway – a bar and dance area on the ground floor of a building that fulfilled his commitment to open his party office in his North London constituency. Corbyn was paying its rent and some staff salaries out of his own pocket. Simultaneously, he owed a large sum to the Inland Revenue for his employees’ unpaid National Insurance and pension contributions.Revealed: How Labour leader\u0027s \u0027joyless\u0027 approach to life and...Jeremy Corbyn faces a backlash from Labour\u0027s women...Labour activists find \u00274,000 examples of anti-Semitism\u0027 on...Share this articleThe financial chaos was matched by his management style. His employees complained about being both undervalued and underpaid.Among the casualties was Liz Phillipson, his battle-scarred assistant, who had resigned rather than continue to tolerate Corbyn’s fecklessness. ‘You haven’t got enough money for what you’re doing,’ Race said bluntly. ‘You should close your office and move to the Commons.‘I won’t,’ replied Corbyn.‘Oh, come on, Jeremy, you know he’s right,’ Claudia said, her voice rising. Corbyn mumbled, then fell silent. His body language showed he felt no inclination to follow Race’s advice. Claudia was becoming noticeably agitated. ‘It was clear a breakdown was coming,’ thought Race.He was not surprised by the tension. Throughout their marriage, Corbyn’s lack of interest in material things had meant that he ignored her need for comfort.          Debt-ridden: Jeremy Corbyn in the 1980sAt one stage she had planned for the family to move from Islington to leafy Kingston upon Thames, but was quickly disabused of the idea. ‘He has to live in his constituency,’ a political aide told her.She got the same short shrift from her husband when she tried to hire a cleaner – a move that prompted one of Corbyn’s friends to question whether his wife had ‘bourgeois tendencies’.To Corbyn, Claudia’s list of complaints was familiar. Over the years, a succession of women had made the same observations: he never changed his ways, and he rarely thought about them.He wore the same shabby clothes, ate the same bland food and stuck to the same dogmatic political convictions he first developed as a teenager.Admirers hailed his inflexibility as proof of his integrity. Detractors blamed his limited intelligence and lack of education for his failure to appreciate others.Long before the onset of their financial problems, life with Corbyn had proved difficult for Claudia. Labour MP Tony Banks witnessed just how difficult as one day he walked into Westminster’s central lobby and spotted her standing by the wall, tearfully holding her children.Jeremy, Claudia explained, had promised to meet her two hours earlier. He had not turned up. Banks took the four Corbyns to the Commons family room and went off in search. Eventually he found Corbyn in a committee room. ‘You’d better come out and look after your children,’ he suggested. Corbyn did not seem fazed for a moment. Banks was not surprised. ‘When pushed to have a day off,’ he recalled, ‘Jeremy’s idea was to take his partner to Highgate Cemetery and study the grave of Karl Marx.’His old friend Reg Race had experienced something similar when he had invited the Corbyn family for a week’s holiday at his country home in Derbyshire.On the day, Claudia arrived with the children.‘Where’s Jeremy?’ asked Mandy, Reg’s wife. ‘I don’t know,’ replied Claudia with sadness. ‘He just told me, “I’ve got to go to a meeting”, and I haven’t seen him since.’Over the following 36 hours, Claudia called several numbers searching for her husband. Two days later he turned up, explaining his absence as a necessary sacrifice for ‘the movement’.By the time Race was called in to help resolve Corbyn’s financial crisis, the marriage was all but over.          Corbyn had regularly picked wood from neighbourhood skips, and also collected railway junk as he criss-crossed the country on trainsThat afternoon Race told his friend that he had little choice but to sell the family home.Claudia agreed. Reluctantly, so did Corbyn – and thereafter broke off his relations with Race. The messenger was to blame, a failure to take personal responsibility that left Race to conclude of the man he’d worked closely with over three decades: ‘He’s not fit to be leader of the Labour Party, and not fit to be Britain’s Prime Minister.’In early 1999, the Corbyns’ home was sold for £365,000 (£730,000 today), and they downsized to a house in Mercers Road, a shabby street off Holloway Road.On the day of the move, Corbyn was told by Claudia to empty the fridge. He forgot. He also forgot to clear the garage. Late in the afternoon, while their former home’s new owner fumed on the pavement, the garage door was opened to reveal rubbish crammed to the ceiling.Corbyn had regularly picked wood from neighbourhood skips, and also collected railway junk as he criss-crossed the country on trains. Boxes of safety lamps, metal signs, track signals and other paraphernalia had been stuffed in any old how. Late in the day, everything was finally shuttled across to the basement of Mercers Road, creating a new world of clutter.The move brought one advantage. The building had been converted into bedsits, making the estrangement between Claudia and Corbyn easier.She and their three sons took the top floors, where she lived with a young South American dubbed ‘the toy boy’, while Corbyn, in the basement, had relationships with a series of younger women.The Labour leader has always done his best to conceal his chaotic personal life from the media – which he loathes. His break-up with Claudia was no different, shrouded as it was with obfuscation and lies.Late in 1999, while Corbyn was at a peace conference in The Hague, a journalist contacted his wife and asked whether the two had separated. She said their 12-year marriage had ended in 1997. She said she had wanted their 11-year-old son Ben to go to Queen Elizabeth’s grammar school in Barnet, but that Corbyn had stipulated that he should go instead to Holloway School, a failing local comprehensive.From The Hague, Corbyn confirmed Claudia’s account. Defending his ideological purity against selective schools, he implied, was more important than his son’s education – or his marriage.In a series of interviews, Claudia reinforced the same message. ‘My children’s education is my absolute priority, and this situation left me with no alternative but to accept a place at Queen Elizabeth Boys’ School. I had to make the decision as a mother and a parent… It isn’t a story about making a choice, but about having no choice.’To the public, Corbyn appeared to have acquiesced in his wife’s wishes, but, like so many communists, he had put his political principles first, and ended the marriage: he could not live with a woman who did not accept his beliefs.The only dent to that image of ideological purity was Claudia’s revelation that Corbyn had agreed for another of their sons to spend two years at the local Montessori nursery, at £600 per term.If that had been the last word on the subject, the notion that the marriage had broken up over Corbyn’s principles might have been plausible. But Claudia, possibly with Corbyn’s encouragement, went further. ‘He is first the politician and second the parent,’ she said. ‘It’s very difficult when your ideals get in the way of family life… It has been a horrendous decision.’Sixteen years later, the whole tale was expanded. Rosa Prince, Corbyn’s semi-authorised biographer, described, with Claudia’s help, a tormented family: ‘Corbyn and Bracchitta went round and round in circles for months.‘She would not send Ben to Holloway School and Corbyn could not bear for him to go to Queen Elizabeth’s… In choosing Queen Elizabeth’s, Bracchitta was aware that she was ending her marriage.’Is this version correct? Friends say the marriage ended because of Corbyn’s behaviour – his financial fecklessness, his thoughtless absences and his selfish refusal to do anything to make his wife’s life more pleasant.‘He told me that the marriage had ended long before the school bit,’ Ken Livingstone recalled. ‘We had a chat at the time and he said his marriage had fallen apart over other things, not the school.’Livingstone had discovered that Corbyn’s ‘authenticity’ was fictitious – a confection for political appearances. Like his great hero Lenin, the Labour leader had mastered a critical ruse to grab public support: ‘A lie told often enough’, wrote the Soviet revolutionary, ‘becomes the truth.’ Few politicians have deployed this tactic as ruthlessly and effectively as Jeremy Corbyn.lDangerous Hero: Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power, by Tom Bower, is published by William Collins on February 21 at £20.

Rather than be spurred on by setbacks, he has instead channelled his frustration into a life framed by bitterness and envy.As Bower writes: ‘He came to loathe achievers… disdained those who enjoyed material wealth… most of all he hated the rich and successful, and identified with losers. In his self-protection he became conspicuously stubborn.’Corbyn’s inability to run an office, let alone the country, is a recurring theme.     Bower writes: ‘He came to loathe achievers… disdained those who enjoyed material wealth… most of all he hated the rich and successful, and identified with losers\u0027In his 20s he was sacked as a researcher for the engineering workers’ union because his work was sub-standard as a young MP, his agent resigned on the grounds that Corbyn was ‘an anarchic shambles, without any discipline’ and when he won the party leadership in 2015, his office was described as ‘fraught, tense and unhappy’, where staff were ‘lazy and p***ed on £100k a year’.Shockingly, the author claims that Corbyn was even unable to discharge his most basic duty as an MP.Bower makes no excuse for delving deep into Corbyn’s private life to shed light on his personal qualities – or lack of them.Corbyn’s first two marriages, along with numerous other relationships, were characterised by ‘his financial incompetence, his thoughtless absences, his neglect of his family and his apparent misogyny’.Corbyn is offering himself up as the nation’s next First Lord of the Treasury, yet his own debts nearly led to him losing his home. He appears never to read books, seemingly restricting himself to a quick flick through the communist newspaper Morning Star.Revealed: How Labour leader\u0027s \u0027joyless\u0027 approach to life and...Share this articleThis lack of intellectual curiosity must be an unprecedented trait among putative prime ministers.His first two wives agree that life with Corbyn was narrow and joyless: they all talk about his shabby clothes, tolerance of bland food and endlessly recited, yet utterly inflexible, beliefs. One Christmas Day, keen to avoid his family and with no political rallies to attend, he decided to spend it alone with his dog on a windswept beach.These were the factors behind the collapse of his marriage to Claudia Bracchita – not, as Corbyn likes to claim, because he objected to her decision to send their son to grammar school.As Bower says: ‘Corbyn has concealed or distorted the nature of his close relationships, his personal life and his prejudices.’          Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn talking at a Labour local government conference in CoventryYou really wouldn’t want to take a holiday with this man unless you enjoy riding pillion on a motorbike tour of Cold War Eastern Europe, or boycotting royal palaces, counting manhole covers and visiting the graves of dead communists.As a work colleague, he found it hard to integrate because he was ‘vegetarian, rarely drank and did not smoke, and neither did he go to the cinema, watch any sport or enjoy any social activity’.Denis Healey talked about politicians having a ‘hinterland’: Corbyn has a wasteland. This is the man who Bower reveals was so demotivated in the months before his shock elevation to leader that he was planning to retire to Wiltshire to ‘keep bees’ – before deciding that he couldn’t afford to.These insights are in the public interest because they ‘go to character’ – and to competence.Perhaps the book’s most devastating line comes from Reg Race, who knew Corbyn well during his time as a young activist.Race tells Bower simply: ‘He’s not fit to be leader of the Labour Party or Prime Minister.’The reader quickly arrives at the same conclusion.As Bower builds his picture, it becomes clear that Corbyn’s ‘friendly-grandpa’ image amounts to a calculated fraud on the public. He is a hologram, generated by the party’s real power brokers: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and union baron Len McCluskey, and buttressed by the youth cult Momentum, which harnesses the power of social media to ruthlessly suppress moderate opposition.Bower reveals the level of cynicism involved: the hard-Left McDonnell was always intended to be the ‘bad cop’ to Corbyn’s supposed ‘good cop’, and the Labour leader was deliberately kitted out in a blue suit to make him look like a respectable ‘bank manager’, even if his socialist policies make him more like a bank robber.The most notorious stain on Corbyn’s character has been left by the shocking anti-Semitism displayed by his followers, and his habit of hanging out with terrorists and their sympathisers.Corbyn’s pro-Palestinian activism is well-established, symbolised by him being present when a wreath was laid alongside the graves of PLO terrorists.What Bower suggests, controversially, is that Corbyn’s views were forged in his youth: not just because of his pro-Palestinian beliefs, but because as a union worker he grew to believe in ‘the malign collective power of Jews’.Bower says that, even as a young MP, Corbyn refused to visit a centre for Orthodox Jews and ranked Holocaust survivors low down the list of victims of historic tragedies. He also describes a mood of ‘flippant disdain’ in his office before they met Jewish leaders to discuss their concerns. Says Bower: ‘Corbyn was an empty vessel, uneasy with a race complicated by its history of survival.’On the biggest single political issue to face this country in a generation, Corbyn has been Janus-faced. While the vast majority of Labour MPs supported Remain, it is clear from Bower’s book that Corbyn and his henchmen only went through the motions of campaigning to stay in the European Union.Corbyn, McDonnell and chief adviser Seumas Milne actually wanted Brexit. Not for reasons of patriotism, but because they regard Brussels rules on state aid as a threat to their socialist agenda – and hoped that Brexit would destabilise the Tories sufficiently to let in a Labour government (a wish that could yet come true).Corbyn’s gang blatantly undermined and marginalised Alan Johnson, the Labour co-ordinator of the Remain campaign, and struck all mentions of staying in the EU from leaflets.Corbyn himself did a disappearing act on the night of the vote. All of this makes his vitriolic denunciations of the Tory splits on Brexit seem even more cynical and hypocritical.The reader puts down this book convinced that Corbyn presents the largest single threat to Britain’s security and prosperity for more than a generation.If elected, he would be the most Left-wing prime minister in history with the same suicidal socialist beliefs as his political mentor, Tony Benn.But while Margaret Thatcher was able to crush the Bennites, and send them into the political wilderness, Theresa May’s distracted and ided Tories are level pegging with Labour in the polls.Recent electoral projections by Tory HQ put Corbyn in No 10 as the head of a coalition if a poll were held tomorrow.As the Tory election guru Lynton Crosby discovered to his cost in 2017, the bedrock of Corbyn’s support comes from the under-40s, who feel priced out of the housing market and exiled from the comfortable lives enjoyed by the over-65 baby-boomers.So when Crosby carpet-bombed the media with reminders of Corbyn’s links to the IRA, most of his supporters just shrugged: to them it was ancient history.Nor, worryingly, are the charges of anti-Semitism damaging his poll ratings as much as they should: Corbyn’s supporters in Momentum use their aggressive stranglehold on social media to dismiss the allegations as ‘fake news’ disseminated by the ‘mainstream media’.This is why Bower’s book should serve as such an important corrective. The charge sheet he draws up against Corbyn is long, detailed and irrefutable.He is not fit for office, and must never be allowed to become Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"How Brooklyns model girlfriend Hana Cross 21 walking advert Brand Beckham","story":"    Chic: With Brooklyn at a party last week where Cross, 21, wore a Victoria Beckham chain shirt (£100), a Victoria Beckham camo jacket (£1,195) and Victoria Beckham leather trousers (£1,765)ALEXANDRA SHULMAN\u0027S NOTEBOOK: Quitting my dream job as...EXCLUSIVE: From the West Wing to the West Coast!

Luciana Berger, who was threatened with motions of no confidence last weekJeremy Corbyn supporters subjected a Jewish Labour MP to vicious racist attacks over claims she plans to join a breakaway political movement.Luciana Berger, who was threatened with motions of no confidence last week by members of her Liverpool Wavertree party, was called a ‘dirty little Zionist rat’ and a ‘c***’ on a Facebook page of a local constituency party. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had sparked a backlash among supporters of the MP by suggesting she should have pledged loyalty to Labour and linking her to the alleged Labour ‘breakaway’ party.In response to the reports that she might leave, one message read: ‘At f****** last the dirty little zionist RAT I f****** hate her. What’s the bets the day she leaves labour she’ll be a Tory by midnight’.Activists had accused the Jewish MP of ‘undermining’ Mr Corbyn by criticising his stance on anti-Semitism and Brexit, but withdrew their motions of no confidence following an intervention from the Labour leadership.Ms Berger was also taunted on pro-Corbyn websites suggesting falsely that she was an ‘agent of a foreign power’, an ‘Israel attack dog’ and ‘Tory scum’.                         Corbyn only agreed to campaign to stay in the EU after protests from Remainers in his Shadow Cabinet, led by Hilary Benn. But his deliberate sabotage of his own campaign was highlighted when he decided to attend the British Kebab Awards rather than attend a major Remain rally, on the advice of his most senior adviser, Seumas Milne.Bower writes that, on the night of the referendum, Corbyn ‘disappeared’, and the following morning was ‘seen laughing over breakfast with his team’. He says: ‘Although Milne and McDonnell admitted to voting Leave, Corbyn would deny that he had done so.’Further evidence has also emerged about Corbyn’s real anti-EU views. Footage of him addressing the Durham Miners Gala in 2010, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, shows him condemning ‘the world’s bankers, International Monetary Fund, European Union’ for being ‘utterly united in what they want. Utterly united in deflation, suppressing the economy, and creating unemployment.’The revelations come as at least six Labour MPs who object to Corbyn’s policy on Brexit are believed to be in talks about a breakaway movement.Corbyn threw his party into turmoil last week by setting out a series of demands to Theresa May in return for Labour’s support for her Brexit deal, including membership of a customs union. The move enraged many of his pro-Remain MPs, including Mr Umunna, who called it ‘totally demoralising’ because it would kill off their plans for a second referendum.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis added: ‘For decades Jeremy Corbyn peddled his blinkered world view and hard-Left ideology from the Commons backbenches – happier to sow dissent than heal ision, to criticise than to seek consensus. He is not a backbench MP any more – he is a man who wants to be our Prime Minister but one who still refuses to accept the responsibilities that come with leadership.‘He failed to face facts over the Salisbury poisoning, he has shamefully failed to root out racism in his own ranks and he has failed to set out a credible plan for Brexit.‘He has stood by as the Labour Party, with its proud tradition of decency and patriotism, succumbed to the mentality of mob rule and has stayed silent while his own MPs are bullied and hounded online.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Countdown star Rachel Riley teaming advisers Blairs government launch new party","story":"\u0027She was shocked when we entered\u0027: Jeremy Corbyn drove two...Share this articleAfter the rebels’ meeting, one source said: ‘There was a presentation which lasted for about 45 minutes and was followed by a Q\u0026ampA.

Shipwrecked on his desert island for 28 years, he builds shelter, finds God and discovers companionship through compassion. Jane Gardam’s Crusoe’s Daughter draws on this robust example through Polly Flint, who transcends her isolation through reading and liberalism.Coming to terms with loneliness is harder. Anita Brookner’s entire oeuvre is poignantly preoccupied by the stoicism required for an intelligent spinster. Barbara Pym’s Quartet in Autumn is funnier, and Brian Moore’s The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne sadder.People can be lonely within relationships, too, as John Williams’s masterpiece Stoner shows. An unremarkable American academic “cut out for failure”, his cold, doomed marriage is the opposite to that of Anne Tyler’s widower in The Accidental Tourist. Chances change lives, as do choices.Olivia Laing’s The Lonely City builds on Colin Wilson’s concept of artists as outsiders and is fascinating, bracing and informative. However, the children’s classic Goodnight Mister Tom provides the most comfort in its affecting portrait of how a bitter old countryman is transformed by taking in an abused London boy during the blitz.

The British establishment believed in our innate common sense, as did admiring foreigners.Weirdly, the supposedly cynical British public still does. Voters damn politicians, but assume they will somehow find a way through. I doubt their confidence will last and they will soon see our new United Kingdom of Absurdistan for what it is: a land where civil servants send military advisers into government departments, as if the mandarins were planning a coup, or draw up emergency measures to lift the Queen fall-of-Saigon style from Buckingham Palace or stockpile medicines as if we were at war. We are at war in a sense, only Brexit is a war the British have declared on themselves and still do not realise they are fighting.The British stiff upper lip cannot explain the absence of fear: if it ever existed, it wilted long ago. Rather, the deep complacency of British and in particular English life, which sleeps soundly beneath all the noise of the news cycle, still makes the average citizen believe it can’t happen here. The only major European country to escape both communism and fascism, or occupation by the armies of Hitler or Stalin, has an ingrained bias against taking the possibility of disaster seriously. We’ve always managed before, previous alarms have turned out to be false, are the default responses of a country that has yet to learn that the past does not always determine the future.The secrecy imposed on the civil service is the second reason why, if trouble comes, it will appear to come from nowhere. The truth is that we have a hidden government, thinking the unthinkable in secret, not as an academic parlour game in which an idea is reduced to absurdity for intellectual pleasure, but as a means of stopping voters realising the scale of the trouble we may be facing. Our shadow administration could take £2bn of public money and is organised in 320 “DExEU workstreams”, if I may inflict Whitehall’s barbarous jargon on you.Civil servants are not in despair. Like soldiers desperate to fight, or journalists determined to get their name on the big story, they want to be involved. “It’s the greatest challenge of their careers,” Dave Penman, from the FDA, the trade union for civil servants, told me. Of course they want to be part of it. Names will be made, careers enhanced, gongs won. Who wants to sit in the education department worrying about children when the great Brexit game is afoot?However much they enjoy it, they must know they can’t win it. Contrary to the propagandists of left and right, civil servants obey orders. But our collapsing political system can no more provide the civil service with a clear direction than it can tell the country where it will be by the summer. Are they meant to be preparing for no deal, May’s deal, the Norway deal or no Brexit? There was a moment of comic bathos when Philip Rycroft, permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the European Union (that’s DExEU, the one with all the “workstreams”) told MPs his civil servants “need to get their head around what the realities are of the world we are in now, what the negotiating objectives and negotiating realities are and how to translate the outcome of the negotiations – whatever that is”.“Whatever that is…” I can think of no better way of describing Britain’s absurdity. “Brexit means Brexit – whatever that is.” “We are delivering the will of the people – whatever that is.” “The EU must give us a new withdrawal agreement – whatever that is.” Whatever that is, it is not competent public administration, let alone one that can cope with a Britain engaging in a wanton act of destruction.Despite the secrecy, we know that Britain is nowhere near building and policing effective borders – so much for “taking back control”, whatever that is. We know there may be “putrefying piles of rubbish”, so there will no “clean break” – whatever that is.But overall we know far less than we have a right to know. To date, criticism of the administrative response has come from a right whose lack of concern for its fellow citizens borders on the sociopathic. Until we leave, it must pretend that warnings about the cost of Brexit on jobs, the public services and the tax take are lies spread by “politically influenced” civil servants fiddling with the figures, as Jacob Rees-Mogg said of Treasury forecasts of economic decline. The right must fight as hard as it can until 29 March and preserve the illusion that we can topple over the cliff edge and land without so much as a bruise. When we’re out, the story will change and the right will need the civil service in the stab-in-the-back myth it is developing to protect itself from public anger. Brexit will have failed, it will say, not because it was national mistake but because it was betrayed by the Whitehall establishment that wanted us to remain in the EU all along.If a word of this were true, Remainer civil servants would be refusing to work on Brexit. The most principled would resign, saying they did not enter public service to do their country harm. In fact, volunteers are flocking to work on Brexit and staff numbers have risen to a number not seen since the Second World War (so much for the right’s dream of a deregulated Brexit Britain – whatever that was).As the Institute for Government, MPs and MEPs warn, the genuine scandal has nothing to do with the fantasy biases of the civil service and everything to do with secrecy. Businesses don’t know what to expect from government and what they need to do. Neither does the supposedly sovereign people in whose name Brexit is being delivered. Whatever Brexit is, they will be left in ignorance until it is too late to do anything about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee271862176a017b2b8469a139338e54193bb29/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6afda3e3a03e6413a40234d2a26b0ad5","title":"theresa may england maidenhead brexit","story":"A river runs through it, and so does the chablis – but Maidenhead is a town of submerged currentsPeople make the journey to Maidenhead for different reasons. Fiction offers contrasting examples. George Harvey Bone, the tortured soul at the heart of Patrick Hamilton’s novel Hangover Square, reached the town just after war broke out in 1939, after walking all the way from Earl’s Court and the bodies of the couple he’d killed the previous morning. To him, the word Maidenhead meant past innocence and future salvation. He imagined he would find “peace, the river, an inn, a quiet glass of beer, and safety, utter safety …” Ascoyne d’Ascoyne in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets, on the other hand, went there for something livelier: to spend a weekend with his mistress at a Thames-side hotel, which was the fashion among the louche and wealthy in the Edwardian days when Maidenhead’s reputation came second only to Brighton’s as the raciest town in England.Both men promptly died there – Bone by sticking his head over a gas ring, D’Ascoyne when his punt tipped over a weir (no accident). The visitor to Maidenhead can walk down to the riverside and see the spot where the episode in that most perfect of Ealing comedies was shot. In life, it was the old Guards Club, where the officers from the brigade’s barracks at Pirbright and Windsor would come to dance, swim and row, and befriend the chorus girls who lived across the river in the so-called Gaiety houses that took their name from the London music hall. In the film, the club grounds become a hotel garden where Alec Guinness as the arrogant D’Ascoyne is solicitously pouring champagne for his lover – unaware that life, like a weekend, is short.I sat on a bench there on Wednesday and looked at the rowers slicing through the current. This was the pleasant side of Maidenhead: black-and-white, neo-Jacobean villas with cupolas and turrets boathouses willows. Upstream lay Cookham and Marlow and downstream Bray and Windsor – placenames associated with monarchs, Michelin-starred restaurants and popular entertainers who are variously dead or alive or released on licence: Diana Dors, Ernie Wise, Michael Parkinson, Rolf Harris.The comic novelist John O’Farrell, who grew up in Maidenhead (and in 2001 stood as the constituency’s Labour candidate), once characterised this stretch of the Thames Valley as “Tory since the Bronze Age”, a corner of Middle England with inhabitants who “somehow give the impression of having been nouveau riche for 10 successive generations”. That may be accurate so far as it goes, but it misses Maidenhead’s position at the centre of English life. From a riverside bench in Maidenhead you can see plane after plane climb into the air from Heathrow, and new Japanese trains whiz to and from Paddington over Brunel’s bridge – the same bridge that Turner painted in Rain, Steam and Speed. And since 2016, to complete this overcrowded picture of England in miniature, past and present, Maidenhead’s MP has also been the UK’s prime minister.The town, as opposed to its almost-suburb on the riverbank, is rather ugly. It grew up around the railway station in the 19th century and has been badly knocked about by property developers over the past 60 years, so that its centre holds chastening examples of every architectural fashion since the 1950s. A few remnants of an earlier time persist. A plaque at the little stadium of Maidenhead United FC, for example, records that it first saw a football match on 16 February 1871, making it the world’s “oldest senior football ground continuously used by the same club”. An isolated terrace of tall houses in brown Victorian brick awaits demolition nearby, its corner pub closed and every window boarded. These were homes for a working class in the small towns of southern England that popular history tends to forget.Theresa May’s parents came from this class. According to Rosa Prince’s biography of May, both of her grandmothers were domestic servants a great-grandfather was a butler other ancestors included carpenters, dressmakers and soldiers of no rank higher than sergeant major. By the early years of the last century, most of them had left rural cottages in Surrey and Devon for workaday homes near London. Her mother grew up in a terrace house in Reading with an outside lavatory at the back and a view of tram tracks from the front. It was her father’s occupation as vicar that gave the family a different view of themselves or who they might become.May won Maidenhead for the first time in 1997 and since then has increased her share of the vote from roughly half to roughly two-thirds. She seems well liked. People speak admiringly of the time she gives to her constituency “when she has all this other stuff to worry about”. They like her sense of duty, but then she likes that about herself too: “I grew up the daughter of a local vicar and the granddaughter of a regimental sergeant major. Public service has been part of who I am for as long as I can remember.”The chair of the town’s Conservative Association, Councillor Richard Kellaway, voted remain partly for the interesting reason that in his work as an oil industry consultant he had always found Brussels easier to deal with than Whitehall. When I asked him if Brexit had caused isions in the local party, he said that “by and large” it stood right behind her: there had been “no ferment”. He was a friendly, steady kind of man as was Pat McDonald, parish councillor and Labour candidate at the last general election.The fact is that nothing very bad has happened in Maidenhead, outside the exercise of personal appetites. The place to satisfy them used to be Skindles, a riverside hotel that began life as a coaching inn and later became notorious as a leading home counties venue for adultery. It was demolished in 2015 and replaced by expensive houses and a brasserie, Roux at Skindles – where for lunch, in a vague attempt to revive the Edwardian spirit, I decided to have a bowl of fish soup and a glass of the house champagne.They came. I ate. “If we don’t like the chablis we’ll just throw it away,” said an animated, silver-haired man to a waiter at an adjacent table, sounding as if he owned the place, which he did. Reviving the Edwardian spirit even further, I had my card delivered to his table with a note. “Dear M Roux, I wonder if you could spare two minutes for …” He came over, which was good of him. I wanted to ask where he stood on Brexit. “My opinion changes every five minutes,” he said, “but whatever we do, deal or no deal, in five years we’ll be laughing.”It was reassuring. Look out in 2024 for those Roux branches opening in Sunderland and Stoke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff098b410cef1c174eb5bda698269370d4c5849/0_44_4144_2486/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fc1a21749e8b9346b56abc5a6947525","title":"teacher pay down real terms since 2003","story":"Ministers have conceded that teachers’ pay has fallen by thousands of pounds a year since the public spending austerity drive began, amid warnings of a “looming crisis” in attracting and retaining new staff.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We welcome the DfE’s admission that teachers’ pay has fallen so far in real terms. It is no good Damian Hinds trying to argue that this is the same for private sector jobs – those figures reflect the many graduates forced into low-paid, part-time, semi-casual jobs, whereas we are talking about the pay rates being offered to those joining a profession.”“The government’s new bursary scheme for early-career teachers may help to tackle acute retention problems in shortage subjects and disadvantaged parts of the country. But, unless it is applied immediately to existing teachers, it is likely to be a few years before we see any improvements to exit rates.”Hinds has announced that English schools will no longer be punished for failing to meet government standard on tests, in an attempt to release teachers from the stress of results and stop schools with challenging pupils from being punished. He also wants to cut down on marking, data collection and lesson planning.However, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said years of cuts had led to teachers being “thousands of pounds a year worse off. Across our schools we are seeing the result in the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention. Teacher recruitment targets have been missed year after year, with more teachers leaving the profession than joining. In response to this crisis, the government will give the majority of teachers another real-terms pay cut.”Labour is pledging to end the public sector pay cap with additional, ring-fenced funding.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Last summer saw the biggest teacher pay rise in almost 10 years, worth between £800 and £1,366 for classroom teachers and supported by a £508m government grant. In addition to an annual pay award, many teachers also receive increases from promotions and responsibility allowances.“Whilst we know pay is an important issue for teachers, there are also other factors which can affect recruitment and retention. That is why in January we unveiled the first ever integrated recruitment and retention strategy in England, which will provide teachers with more early careers support and opportunities for flexible and part-time working. The strategy also builds on the work we have done to support school leaders to strip away unnecessary workload.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc77d7696d5b11dd3e6a461701218c464008276d/0_0_1509_905/master/1509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7fb5cb88f7e98f7f8a43aaaea825e57","title":"we love ssix fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Circus fever, a menswear love-in and covetable bags for season ahead"},{"url":null,"title":"bait review mark jenkin hypnotic take on tourists ruining cornwall fishermen","story":"Mark Jenkin’s film about two fishermen coping with the influx of sightseers is intriguing for its distinct visual styleCornish film-maker Mark Jenkin has contributed one of the most arrestingly strange movies in Berlin this year. It’s an adventure in zero-budget analogue cinema, a black-and-white film shot with a Bolex cine-camera on 16mm film, and developed in such a way as to create ghostly glitches and scratches on the print. Now, that’s a nostalgist affectation that is sometimes unconvincing: I’m often agnostic when Guy Maddin does it. But the primitivism of Jenkin’s film is the real thing – and hypnotically strange.A drama on what might be the rather hackneyed theme of tourists ruining Cornwall becomes a bizarre expressionist melodrama. It has the huge closeups and crashingly emphatic narrative grammar of early cinema and, like home movies, it has non-diegetic sound, with dialogue overdubs and ambient noise which could well be taken from a sound effects LP. But it’s very effective, and the monochrome cinematography desentimentalises the Cornish landscape, turning it into an anti-picture postcard. The weirdness of Bait can’t be overestimated, like FW Murnau directing an episode of EastEnders.Martin Ward (Edward Rowe) is a fisherman, a gloweringly aggressive man who resents the incomers who have taken over his village. Fishing is in decline. Where once this industry used bait to catch fish, now the whole community and the beautiful landscape are used as bait to catch tourists. Only it feels as if the tourists are the ones who have the locals in their net.Martin and his brother Steven (Giles King) have been forced to sell their late father’s picturesque harbour-front cottage to Londoners who stay there in the summer and Airbnb the loft to other tourists. With colossal insensitivity, they have gutted the place and redecorated it in a twee “fisherfolk” style with nets and maritime memorabilia on the walls.As Martin growls to his brother: “Ropes and chains like a sex dungeon.” Steven now uses the family’s fishing boat to give tourists sightseeing trips, including crowds of idiotic blokes on stag weekends. Martin himself is saving up for a new boat, but insists on trying to be a fisherman without one, wading out into the surf with a net for sea bass, trying to catch lobster with a single pot, and selling the meagre catch to local pubs and cafes.In his martyred way, he almost savours the humiliation of doing this, and nurses the resentment involved. His irritation with the Londoners explodes when his ramshackle van gets clamped by the security firm for parking in the now-reserved spaces outside his former family home and a hundred other little slights add to his simmering rage.Meanwhile, Steven’s son is more interested in learning the ways of fishing than tourist-pleasing – but his sexual attraction to the young women that arrive with the holidaymakers creates a separate crosscurrent of tension.Jenkin adds to the disorientation by introducing little premonition flashes of events still to come. A young local woman throws a white ball at the tourists’ cottage and, before the police show up, we see a glimpse of the handcuffs still to come. We also see this same white ball superimposed on the ghostly moon.Without the roughness and even crudity of Jenkins’ homemade effects, this “montage” gesture would not have been plausible. But within the stylised visual language he’s using, it works very well.There are other conspicuous juxtapositions: two different scenes will be interleaved, with different characters, in closeup, yelling at each other. What an intriguing and unexpectedly watchable film. Bait is an experiment – and a successful one.

It’s a bizarre, occasionally almost Lynchian film, alienated and alienating, interspersed – initially, at any rate – with dream-visions of biblical scenes in the burning sun. Its borderline preposterous narrative may simply be the pretext for its tableau of strangeness and bacchanal of dysfunction.The introductory sequences seem to be those of a regular police drama about a big-city cop who starts her life again in a sleepy country backwater. It’s the kind of thing that gets shown on TV on Sunday nights, and I even wonder if Tzoumerkas initially developed his project with this more conventional end in view.Angeliki Papoulia plays Elisabeth, a tough police officer in Athens shown coolly interrogating a suspected terrorist. But however capable Elisabeth is, she is to be scared into quitting Athens and lying low, terrified by the possibility that the terrorists are tracking her and her young son. Or, ambiguously, she is sickened by the idea that her superiors are faking the supposed threat with planted photos as a way of making her falsify a confession from their detainee in return for police “protection”.Either way, she and her son fetch up in Mesolongi in remote western Greece, where she is now chief of the local station, disguised like someone in witness protection with a very odd new blond wig or dye-job. She is extravagantly aggressive and heavy-drinking, involved in a messy affair with a local man.Her destiny is to intertwine with a local woman, Rita (played by the movie’s co-writer Youla Boudali), who has the grim job of gutting eels in a factory. Rita is bullied and abused by her creep of a brother, Manolis (Hristos Passalis), who runs a nightclub in the town and appears to be using her as a hostess there to facilitate the movement of drugs through his establishment. Pompous Manolis makes a great show of looking after their elderly dementia-affected mother and taunts Rita with his conviction that the old woman likes him more than her.One night, Manolis – who also appears to have nursed hopes of being a pop star – grabs the mic at his nightclub and lets rip with a meandering song which turns into a rant at how horrible Mesolongi is, to the rage of locals. It is to end in a nightmare on the beach, together with hospital doctor Vassilis (Argyris Xafis), state prosecutor Andreas (Laertis Malkotsis) and his learning-disabled brother Michalis (Thanasis Dovris). And if you didn’t suspect that everyone was involved in some sort of grisly group dysfunction, you certainly would after the thoroughly strange “dinner party” scene at which almost everyone is present.Both Elisabeth and Rita – in their agony – are yearning for (or, perhaps, carried unintentionally down river towards) a Sargasso sea of release, of freedom – this being a spawning site for endangered marine life, including eels. Is this the point? Maybe. It’s a film that generates a lot more heat than light, a psycho-melodrama burning itself to ash in the sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

He played and he was brilliant. My only concern after that was that he scored a goal and everybody wanted to give him a hug.“Everyone in this squad is like that, I can’t speak highly enough of the character and attitude of these players. The mentality of the boys is the only reason we are where we are.”Liverpool’s draws against Leicester and West Ham had allowed Manchester City to go top of the Premier League and Klopp was pleased with the decisiveness Liverpool showed in regaining that position. “We wanted to show a reaction and we did,” he said. “We had difficulties before with players out, there were reasons why we didn’t play well that we cannot speak about too much in public but we are very self-critical.“We knew we were not happy with our performances in the last two or three games but the reaction the boys showed was outstanding. You can win or draw for different reasons but here we don’t just want to come through somehow, we want to play convincing football, and that is what we did. All the goals were brilliant, our counter-pressing game was the best it’s been in a while and I thought it was a very well-deserved three points.”Eddie Howe admitted Bournemouth had been well beaten but claimed the first goal should have been ruled out for offside. He had a point – though it was a very close call, not the sort of travesty that allowed Liverpool to take the lead at West Ham.“The first goal was a huge moment in the match,” he said. “Up to that point our plan to frustrate Liverpool and restrict their space had been working quite well.“It’s frustrating but VAR should assist in those situations next season.

His grandfather, who had served in the navy, retired to Old Hunstanton in north Norfolk, so Patrick’s family would come up and visit, spending time by the coast. Such fond memories played a part when Patrick and his wife Claire, also an architect, started to think about building a holiday and weekend house for themselves and their own young children, Rae and Margo.“The water and the idea of messing around with a dinghy were a massive draw,” says Patrick, founder and principal of Platform 5 Architects. “There was a bit of Swallows \u0026amp Amazons to my childhood and we always used to go sailing when we were on holiday. So when we started looking for a site and we found this I could instantly see all these possibilities for that kind of fun, family holiday lifestyle, and building something new that fitted in with that.”Following an internet trawl, Patrick and Claire came across a derelict bungalow on the edge of Wroxham Broad. The house, which was literally sinking into the water, had twice failed to sell at auction and offered the perfect chance to be replaced with something fresh and contemporary.Having bought the old bungalow, it was relatively simple for the Michells to convince the planners that they should be allowed to build a bespoke, modern home with echoes of vernacular boat sheds and Broads chalets. But there was a host of other logistical challenges to solve, including a narrow access track with weight-restricted bridges, as well as the waterlogged site itself.“We were instantly won over by the location, which is really quite idyllic,” says Patrick. “But it was very wet. The bedrock is about 10m down and the top 4m is just peat, which shrinks and sinks. Our engineer described it as reinforced water and it has zero load-bearing capacity. So we had to use steel-cased piles, banged into the rock layer.”Once the piles had been installed, they supported a steel framework for the house, plus the timber used both to clad the building and to make the adjoining decks that extend to and over the water. All the materials needed to construct the house came in either by barge or by van, ready for assembly by local builders.“We really had to think about the logistics, and the piles alone took a long time to set out,” says Patrick. “The design itself took inspiration from chalets and boat sheds, with its pitched roof-line and red cedar shingle cladding, but we also wanted to create a veranda looking across the water, and have this outdoor room where we could really enjoy the setting and being outside in the fresh air.”Claire helped plan the way the house would work for the family, with an open kitchen and dining area at the centre of the house. It leads to the semi-sheltered veranda, separated by a wall of floor-to-ceiling glass, which frames the views. This easy flow from inside to outside was one of the key elements of the project.“We had a lot of conversations about the kitchen and dining area and how it would work,” says Claire. “It took us time to work it through, and then we decided to design a custom bench alongside the dining table – which was made by my father – and that helped to anchor the space and meant we didn’t have too many chairs floating around. Those are the kinds of things we did together.”A big sliding door opens to the double-height sitting room where Tom Dixon ceiling lights float like satellites in the open space. A fireplace in a custom-built unit partially separates a library to the back. The effect is a welcome balance between open space and intimate escapes.“Having those retreats was important to me,” says Claire. “Contemporary architecture can be cold so we wanted spaces that are comfortable and warm. The children love that library den because you still feel part of things but you have your own special space.”The other side of the house has two bedrooms on the ground floor, and two upstairs, accessed via a spiral staircase in the hallway, which also serves as the main entrance. It’s one of a series of bespoke elements, but there’s also a blend of design classics and high-street gems among the mix of furniture and lighting.The family’s favourite spot has to be the veranda, facing the channel to the Broad and looking across the neat pontoon, where Patrick and Claire moor their canoe. “We’ve found that the veranda works really well all year round,” he says. “Even when it’s raining, you can be out here looking out at the Broad and the whole place fizzes. The relationship between the veranda and the kitchen also works really well. A friend came to stay with us the other day and compared it to a kind of command centre or ship’s bridge. It has that feel to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/528b58316f97ac43b0ef33dd755f77ec21d84426/0_91_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e02ebf71221cc5421530c00e952640de","title":"is kombucha good for you","story":"Consumption of fermented food and drink has soared recently, but are probiotic products really that beneficial?When David Begg first approached pubs around the UK about the possibility of stocking non-alcoholic kombucha drinks, he was greeted with a mixture of bewilderment and defiance.“Back then, there were still a lot of pub owners saying, ‘My pub is for people who want to drink alcohol. I want to sell beer and wine,’” says Begg, an entrepreneur who founded Real Kombucha towards the end of 2017.Fast forward 18 months and the naturally fizzy drink, made from fermented tea, has rapidly moved from its hipster beginnings to the mainstream. After initial rejections, Begg’s kombucha range will soon be stocked in more than 1,000 pubs across the country. This change of tack is evident across the pub and bar industry, driven by a growing demand for a wider choice of non-alcoholic drinks, especially among the health-conscious millennial generation.This tipping point has coincided with the rapid rise of fermented foods in general, a market that is expected to top £30bn by 2022, thanks to the booming wellness industry. British supermarkets now regularly stock ranges of sauerkraut and the Korean vegetable side dish kimchi, while fermented milk drinks such as kefir can be found everywhere from Tesco to fast food chain Leon. With tennis players and even Premier League footballers now swigging pickle juice mid-match to ward off muscle cramps, fermented foods have gained a foothold in the nation’s larders.But as Hinchley points out, it isn’t just the distinctive taste that lies behind their popularity. Much of the interest has been fuelled by the explosion of media attention around the health benefits of consuming live bacteria and the array of microbes present in kimchi, kombucha and the rest has seen them branded “superfoods”.What many consumers don’t realise is that it isn’t quite so straightforward. For while fermented foods have some proved benefits, even the most optimistic scientists admit that many of the claims being bandied around are based on somewhat flimsy science.After a quick Google search, you could be forgiven for thinking that fermented foods are a cure-all. The health benefits ascribed to them include boosting the immune system, improving gut health and reducing your odds of diabetes, as well as tackling cancer, arthritis and even depression.“There’s a lot of hype,” cautions Maria Marco, professor of food science and technology at the University of California, Davis. “There are some general properties of these foods that could conceivably have an impact on our body, and perhaps help the immune system, but they’re not drugs. It’s ridiculous to think that they could treat diseases like cancer.”Right now, the only clinical benefit accepted by the European Food Safety Authority is that fermented dairy products are suitable for people with lactose intolerance, because the bacteria within them break down the lactose in milk as part of the fermentation process. As fermentation is a form of predigestion, these foods are also thought to be more easily processed by people with irritable bowel syndrome or digestive issues.But digestion aside, scientists have so far struggled to demonstrate a clear cause and effect between consuming fermented food and improved health. Much of the media excitement has revolved around the supposed ability of these foods to improve the balance of healthy bacteria in the gut, but in reality microbiologists say that a few spoonfuls of yoghurt or kimchi will make little or no difference to this vast colony of microbes.“Inside our gut, each of us has at least 100tn microbes,” says Prof Zhaoping Li, head of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Even if one of these foods contains 100m microbes, it’s very trivial in comparison. Many of them will be killed when passing through our stomach and if they make it to the gut, it’s not touching anything.”Despite the “superfood” tagline, many fermented food manufacturers focus on the sensory and sophistication angles when promoting their products, rather than the health side of things. This is largely because of a sparsity of human evidence. The studies that claim different fermented products have anticancer properties, or the ability to control cholesterol and hypertension, have mostly been carried out on laboratory animals or inidual cell lines. Only a few clinical trials have investigated whether consuming fermented products can have a beneficial effect on health metrics such as blood pressure or insulin resistance. These have so far returned mixed results, with the studies often containing severe flaws in their design.“They’re typically looking at something like blood pressure over 21 or 28 days,” says Robert Hutkins, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who researches the link between fermented foods and human health. “But blood pressure varies ordinarily, so you really need to study it over 90 or 120 days to have any idea if there’s a significant change.”Most of the other claims have come from population studies that compare parts of the world where people eat a high proportion of fermented foods with places where they don’t and analyse the relative prevalence of different diseases. But these types of studies are vague and notoriously difficult to interpret.“Koreans have a lower risk factor for bowel disease than Americans,” Li says, “but that isn’t necessarily because they eat more fermented foods. It could be genetics or because they eat more fish or the fact that overeating is less common. There are so many potential confounding factors at play.”Because the rise in popularity in fermented foods in the UK is a relatively recent phenomenon, the industry is in many ways, a bit of a wild west. Hutkins admits that most of the clinical trials conducted on these foods have been funded directly by the companies trying to sell them, such as Danone or Nestlé, while there’s currently little or no regulation covering the labelling or manufacturing process of fermented products.As a result, scientists say that fermented foods found on supermarket shelves can have high sugar or sodium contents. Many also contain large amounts of preservatives, meaning that customers are sometimes buying expensive milk or cabbage that doesn’t contain any live microbes.“It’s not always clear from the packaging but in general, the more processing that’s been done, the worse the product is,” says Dr Paul Cotter, head of food biosciences at the Irish Agricultural and Food Development Authority Teagasc’s food research centre in County Cork. “Steps need to be introduced so that if a product claims to be kefir or kombucha, it must have the associated living microbes in there and be made in a certain way.”One common claim on fermented food labels is that they contain probiotic organisms, specific microbial strains that have a proved health benefit. But in reality, relatively few products are tested to find out the precise types of bacteria that are present.“It’s a little bit problematic that anybody can stick ‘probiotic’ on their label without having to identify what species of bacteria are in the food,” Marco says. “It signals that it’s healthy, but we don’t necessarily know that those particular microbes are ones we would define as probiotic.”Change may be on the cards, however. Such is the interest in fermented foods that governing bodies have been forced to get involved, particularly in the US, where sales of kombucha are growing at a faster rate than any other soft drink. The National Institute of Health is currently funding clinical trials into various fermented products and there are high hopes that this will yield more concrete information on their health benefits in the next five to 10 years. “This will be very interesting,” Hutkins says. “If it’s funded by the government, then the results are publishable, no matter what they find.”And while much has been written about the potential of fermented foods to have an impact on what bacteria live in our guts, Marco believes any notable benefit may instead come from their interactions with the small intestine, possibly by stimulating the immune system and preventing toxins from getting into the bloodstream. “There’s a possibility that the microbes in these foods could directly impact the intestinal cells,” she says. “There’s far fewer microbes there compared to the gut and also a lot more exposure to our food. It also happens to be the place where most of our immune cells are.”If there do turn out to be any clear benefits, scientists say we should still expect them to be relatively small. Eating a balanced diet, minimising stress levels and getting good quality sleep all have a far greater effect on our body as a whole than any single food. “Consuming fermented foods instead of highly processed foods or drinking something like Coca-Cola is probably better for you, but that alone is not going to make a huge change to your health,” Li says. “It’s all relative. No food is going to have a dramatic, wide-ranging effect on the body, like a drug, unless you make wholesale changes to your diet.”Not that kombucha makers are concerned. With a variety of brands and flavour profiles pouring into the market, they believe that the only trajectory is up. “I think it will become an expected part of people’s night out,” Hinchley says. “People now expect the same offering and range they have in coffee and beer, in soft drinks. And kombucha, I think, is going to continue to lead the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591d2a6aade2eb5285e314ca60ae849271eafd53/0_395_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5038b85441cb4013ba1ecff3a3607921","title":"sleep facts and myths","story":"Is an hour’s sleep before midnight as good as two after? Can a lie-in at the weekend make up for late nights during the week? We separate the fact from the fictionA siesta is not the same thing as a power nap. Siestas are a cultural norm in certain places (particularly in hot countries) where people take a brief rest after lunch. We can do this because our circadian biology (body clock) has a natural dip in the afternoon and there is a natural lull in our alertness. If we are extremely sleepy during the day then we should stop and take a nap – especially if our jobs require alertness (lorry drivers, for example). A nap of 15-25 minutes avoids getting into deep sleep, but can still renew levels of alertness and restore the brain’s capacity for learning – and even improve mood. However, sleep is not a commodity to be turned off and on as we see fit. Naps don’t replace the need for night-time sleep.No, but everyone should make sure they get enough sleep. Don’t burn the candle at either end.To some extent, but it’s important to remember our daytime performance during the week will be suboptimal when we have had insufficient sleep during night-time. Sleep is a better investment in productivity overall than working too late and depriving ourselves of sleep.Not necessarily. Everyone has arousals at night, but if they are frequent and troublesome then you should make an appointment with your GP.Not according to research conducted by Oxford University in 2002. It’s “just too mundane to effectively keep worries away”, according to cognitive psychologist Dr Allison Harvey. In test groups, those who thought of idyllic, beautiful places, such as a beach in the south of France, went to sleep on average 20 minutes earlier than they would normally do on nights when they were not concentrating on faraway places. The sheep counters actually stayed awake for longer than their normal ration of restlessness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6db5b3fae0b33bbcf7a63501e0addf0f4f1ec3/17_140_3546_2127/master/3546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8038c966365be6dab430c50287f5201","title":"wild swimming depths of winter natural high","story":"Once the preserve of SAS boot camps, outdoor swims in icy lakes and chilly seas are going mainstreamIn search of inner calm and the ultimate natural high, growing numbers of Britons are braving freezing temperatures to swim in the great outdoors. From freshwater lakes and icy mountain pools to the thrashing waves of the sea, wild winter swimming – once the preserve of thrill-seekers and SAS training camps – is fast going mainstream.Hundreds of clubs have formed across the country, according to the Outdoor Swimming Society, which has seen membership soar to more than 70,000 over the past two years, compared with only a couple of hundred a decade ago.There are 200 mass swims this year – from Devon to the Scottish Highlands – but that is still unlikely to satisfy demand, according to Ella Foote, the group’s spokesperson. “They sell out like Glastonbury – we could fill these events twice over,” she said. And demand remains high despite hefty entry fees ranging from £50 to £150 a splash.The trend for winter dipping has taken off in the past year, Foote believes, because swimmers do not want to go to indoor pools, where there are “so many rules” and you “don’t get the magic of the outdoors”. “Plus, cold water has so many health benefits – it improves your mood, increases blood circulation, it helps with muscular pain,” she said.“It feels bloody cold getting in but you become addicted to the effects of it – you feel great and buzzy all day,” said Mark Harper, who braves a chilly dip in the sea every morning with the Brighton swimming club.His club has become so popular, he said, that they have closed it to new members and a second one has opened down the road. Further along the south coast, near Poole, Dorset, 59-year-old Karen Biles started winter swimming five years ago and has never looked back.“Ninety-nine per cent of my friends think I’ve completely lost the plot. But I don’t get migraines any more, I don’t get colds. I just feel much better all the time,” she said. And it’s not just the physical benefits: “You’re so busy concentrating on not getting too cold that anything that might have been troubling you is forgotten.”A couple of days before the swim, she climbed up in the snow and cut a hole in the ice, to create a makeshift natural ice-bath that was big enough to swim in.“First they were all saying, ‘Why am I doing this?’, screaming and inching in bit by bit, catching their breath,” she said. “Then all of a sudden it just dissipates and you see this delight on their faces.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

The new vote would give the British people a simple choice: to confirm the decision or stay in the EU.The initiative, aimed at breaking the political impasse, is being advanced by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and has won the support of prominent Remainers in the Tory party including Sarah Wollaston, Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry.Kyle says the idea, which is likely to be put forward as an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, is also being taken seriously by “people at a high level in government” as a potential way to resolve the Brexit crisis.The amendment would offer all MPs the chance to support, or abstain on, the withdrawal bill and would specify that, if passed, the decision would be implemented on the condition it was put to the public for approval in a second referendum.If the amendment passed through parliament but the deal was rejected in the subsequent referendum, the UK would stay in the EU under current arrangements.If, however, the British people confirmed the decision of MPs to leave the EU under the terms of May’s deal, Brexit on these terms would immediately come into effect without any need for it to return to parliament. “The beauty of this plan is that it holds attractions for both Leavers and Remainers. For Leavers, if the deal is confirmed by the British people, it offers a definitive end to the withdrawal process with Brexit sealed once and for all. For Remainers, on the other hand, it offers the chance to make the case to stay in the EU to the public, based on facts not promises as before,” said Kyle.“Remainers could vote for May’s deal, or abstain, even though they might not like it, in the knowledge that they could campaign against it later in the referendum.“The key is that Labour and Tory MPs could choose their own way of allowing the bill to pass, yet both will still be able to campaign in the referendum for their real objectives and their principles will remain intact,” he added.Kyle said the plan should also appeal to Theresa May as the only way to get her deal approved both by the factionalised House of Commons and the British public. May’s deal was rejected by a margin of 230 votes, with 118 Tory MPs opposed.Together with Commons clerks, the two Labour MPs have found a precedent for the plan in the way the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland power-sharing passed through parliament in 1998.Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who has been considering when to table an amendment in favour of a second referendum, said the plan was a “very sensible way forward that I would be happy to support”. Soubry and Grieve welcomed the move, as they had always believed that any Brexit deal should be subject to a second referendum. Further efforts could also be made this week by MPs to wrest control of the Brexit process from Theresa May, allowing the 29 March exit day to be delayed, after attempts to do so were rejected less than a fortnight ago. An amendment by Labour’s Yvette Cooper would suspend parliamentary rules which say that only the government can propose legislation to delay article 50, and put MPs in charge, giving them three days in control.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been criticised by some MPs in his party for appearing too ready to help the Tories deliver Brexit, said the option of Labour throwing its weight behind a second referendum would remain “on the table” if the prime minister refused to agree to Labour’s Brexit proposals. “We will keep all options on the table – as agreed in our conference motion – including the option of a public vote,” Corbyn said.Kyle said that his plan had three key advantages. First, it would be a way of reconciling the country to whatever the eventual Brexit outcome turns out to be because it would deliver the “double lock” consent of both MPs and the public. Second, it would offer a definitive end to the Brexit process. And third, it would break the parliamentary paralysis that has long dogged Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9885663e526dc1d8c47965dd4c22ff990798fee7/433_46_1808_1085/master/1808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18e01602d126264ec6be6aad130764d5","title":"sack chris grayling ferry fiasco seaborne freight transport secretary","story":"Theresa May faced cross-party calls to sack her transport secretary, Chris Grayling, last night, after the calamitous collapse of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract handed to a company with no ships.Senior Tories said the prime minister had turned “a blind eye” to Grayling’s decision to award the £13.8m contract to Seaborne Freight to run ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend, despite widespread derision and accusations that it had been awarded illegally.The collapse of the contract comes amid growing unease in the international business community about Britain’s preparedness for a no-deal outcome, with less than 50 days until Brexit is due to take place.Several MPs suggested Grayling should now consider his position after his department revealed the contract had been cancelled, and Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the saga would “just confirm the view of many that this country is in a mess”.Anna Soubry, a former Tory business minister, said Grayling “should be quietly considering his position”.“Chris Grayling holds a critical position in government, trying to mitigate what would be a very serious crisis for the country if we leave the European Union without a deal,” she said. “He has no grip on the very serious nature of his job. The prime minister should also be considering whether there is not someone else who could do the job better.”Another senior Tory MP said Grayling was a “walking disaster zone”, adding: “A no-deal Brexit would be a major national crisis and stories like this suggest we have not got the people in place who are capable of responding to it.”Another said: “Grayling never has a grip on the detail, as the Seaborne mess shows. His Heathrow proposal will be just the same but way more costly. The PM just turns a blind eye, for some reason.”Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “While Theresa May needs the few friends she has right now, we cannot have this incompetent transport secretary heaping humiliation after humiliation on our country. He has to go.”Joining the attacks, Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said: “I very rarely call on ministers to go, but failing Grayling has made too many crass mistakes. He has already lost the confidence of the civil service as they now require a ministerial directive for the government to spend money on ferries.”Downing Street last night said the prime minister had full confidence in Grayling.The Department for Transport said the deal was terminated after Irish company Arklow Shipping, which had backed Seaborne, stepped away from the deal. “It became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements,” a spokeswoman said. “We have therefore decided to terminate our agreement.”Having awarded the contract to a company without ships, the deal with Seaborne descended further into farce when it emerged the company had copied terms and conditions from what appeared to be a pizza delivery company onto its website.Several weeks later, the transport select committee published correspondence with Grayling in which he brushed off allegations that the government may have acted illegally by failing to put the deal out to tender.Lilian Greenwood, the committee’s Labour chair, said the government “should be embarrassed about how this tale is unfolding”. She added: “We must also remember the bigger question we raised, about whether any of the ferry contracts are legal. Grayling’s answer was inadequate and ignored the legitimate concerns.”Lord Kerslake said “severe damage” had already been done to the UK’s international standing and influence as a result of the Brexit vote. “This appalling saga will confirm the view of many that this country is in a mess,” he said. “However committed and able civil servants are they cannot substitute for effective political leadership.”Grayling, one of the cabinet ministers who voted for Brexit at the referendum, was defended by fellow Brexiters last night. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: “The department was right to award this and right to take action now. The important thing is that both Calais and the department are working extremely hard to keep trade moving.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, another leading pro-Brexit Tory MP, suggested Arklow might have ended support after political pressure in Ireland.There is increasing international business concern about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The Japan Business Council in Europe, a body that represents the European arms of 85 Japanese companies including Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toyota, Honda and Panasonic, said its members were preparing for the “severe consequences” of leaving the EU without a deal.“A no-deal exit would bring severe consequences not only to our member companies directly, but also to our supply chains and customers,” said Lars Brückner and Graham Holman, joint heads of the council’s Brexit task force. “It would therefore have a series of negative impacts on the economy and citizens more broadly. JBCE member companies are speeding up and finalising contingency planning in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.“This affects a broad range of business and support activities, including supply chain management and logistics, customs and duties, regulatory and compliance, data flows and transfer, HR and employment and finance and investment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace151e2c3ec64fff9564acdd76b1f7afc076134/0_212_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=db013faae30365f3d5553af530ddf0d4 930w","title":"england france six nations twickenham expectation","story":"France will set out not to lose at Twickenham rather than to win but the hosts should surely have too much for themAs Eddie Jones plots the second instalment of his side’s Six Nations programme against France at Twickenham on Sunday, he has deleted a recording of the victory against Ireland, which was probably his greatest triumph since he took over at the end of 2015. As they say in the head coach’s native Australia, “a rooster one day, a feather duster the next”.England were not burdened by expectation in Dublin but they are overwhelming favourites against France, who have not won at Twickenham since 2005 and whose last away victory in the Six Nations outside Rome or Edinburgh was in Dublin eight years ago. Hubris, rather than Les Bleus, is England’s greatest opponent.“One week ago you guys had Ireland as the best team in the world,” Jones said on Friday. “Now they have suffered a defeat and have four guys out injured, it is a case of batten down the hatches. We live in a world where things keep changing so everything is not good in our team. We are just moving in the right direction.”Which is more than can be said of France. Les Bleus’ latest defeat, at home to Wales when they squandered a 16-0 interval lead, has prompted six changes and a greater emphasis on defence, with the burly Mathieu Bastareaud restored to the midfield and the more lyrical Romain Ntamack relegated to the replacements’ bench. They have become used to firefighting but it is not often that they aim the water in the right direction.There was a jumpiness to Jones in his final media briefing before the match. He usually reclines in his chair as he fields questions but this time he crouched forwards, hands clasped together, as if on edge. Dublin was a tactical triumph, an evening when England so imposed themselves on the grand slam champions and favourites to retain their title that they left with a try bonus point and the greatest harvest of points by a visiting team since England – soon to be world champions – secured the Six Nations title in 2003.The mindset on Sunday is different, no matter the chaotic state of opponents who have become a parody of themselves, extras in a Jacques Tati film. England are still emerging from the wreckage of five successive defeats last year and while the return of the gainline gatecrashers Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi gave them a focal point that was fully exploited by Owen Farrell they were playing against a side that had a settled gameplan based on hogging possession, dictating the pace of a game and defending a lead. Ireland were taken to a place where they were not familiar and could not find the exit.France will be different, and not just because of their reputation for unpredictability. They have become all too predictable, starting with purpose but blowing up in the second half. They led at Twickenham in the final quarter two years ago, having exploited an unfamiliar England back row, primarily through Louis Picamoles. The France No 8 in effect ended the experiment of playing Maro Itoje as a blindside flanker – although he continued to wear the No 6 jersey for the rest of the tournament, trading places with Courtney Lawes – only for James Haskell, Danny Care and Ben Te’o to come off the bench and turn the game.England were sucked into France’s way of playing then, with little pace or flow to the game, and Jones expects the visitors again to keep the ball-in-play time to a minimum by kicking for touch, taking a while to complete a scrum and being in no hurry to get the ball away from a ruck, unless they have won a turnover.“It is hard to get pace in a game against them,” he said. “We are getting longer stoppages now with the way matches are being refereed. We had the Japan coaches Jamie Joseph and Tony Brown with us for the week: they said they were looking for the ball to be in play for 50 minutes in their World Cup matches, but with France it is 30.“I do not think lengthy delays are healthy for the game and we have investigated a few ways of ensuring that we can speed things up.”What was significant in Dublin was England’s speed at getting the ball away from the breakdown, in contrast to their problems in that area last year. While Jones said he was not particularly impressed by his side’s effectiveness in that area against Ireland, their opening try in the second minute suggested otherwise: a succession of quick rucks led to the second-minute score. England will be wary of Arthur Iturria, the openside flanker who was France’s most effective player against Wales. If England are to impose their pace on the game, they will need to neutralise him after a tackle.“We can get better,” said Jones when asked about the Ireland victory. He has lost Maro Itoje, who suffered knee ligament damage against Wales, but did not rule out the second-row returning against Wales in Cardiff in a fortnight. He cited the bulk of the French pack but it will not be as heavy as it was against Wales, when it weighed in collectively at 50kg heavier, with the prop Uini Atonio dropped and the mobile Félix Lambey preferred to Paul Willemse at lock.“We have one of the lightest second-rows in the world,” said the France coach, Jacques Brunel. Lambey and the prop Demba Bamba, who has dislodged Atonio, are 31kg lighter than the players they have replaced as Les Bleus seek greater mobility and staying power, but they have picked a team not to lose rather than to win.It is a seminal moment for Jones, which perhaps explains his edginess, but if England are to make an impact in the World Cup – and France are among their group opponents – they need to leave their mark on Sunday afternoon. Which they should, as a certain bird comes home to roost for their opponents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b9709faaf9fab5ec57c42d8bd3adb9530e16cc6/0_51_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a27d9dbf984d9d4cc24d1bb725246b3a","title":"italy wales six nations match report","story":"Warren Gatland saw Wales given a real scare by Italy and then warned his team of potential embarrassment if they repeat a similar performance against England.There are both positives and negatives for Gatland to consider he made 10 changes here and afterwards alluded to the fact that may have been a mistake. Still, Rome was a fine place for Wales to record a remarkable milestone. This was their 11th straight win, one which equals the country’s record dating back to 1910.Gatland’s men will face England in Cardiff after almost a year unbeaten, still on for a grand slam and with the chance to become statistically the best team in Wales history.It promises to be some occasion at the Principality Stadium on 23 February. Gatland nonetheless told his men they will have to buck up their ideas before meeting Eddie Jones’ side.“We came here, did a job and got the win. Now we can start thinking about the next two weeks and being at home against England in a game that could potentially be a championship decider,” Gatland said. “There are lots of things we need to improve. The lineout was a bit concerning.“We all need to get better and in a lot of areas if we are going to beat England because they are a pretty good side. If we play like that against England it could be embarrassing – but we won’t.”Gatland was unequivocal in the buildup to the game that he was right to make sweeping changes given the bigger picture of building strength in depth for the World Cup.But, after an at times patchy and disjointed display here, he said: “I don’t regret anything, but maybe I need to take some criticism for making so many changes which led to us perhaps not having continuity. With another couple of weeks of preparation we will be better.”In the end, Wales came out on top thanks to second-half tries from Josh Adams and Owen Watkin, while Dan Biggar contributed 14 points. Gatland’s men will now host England looking to make it 12 successive wins.“We didn’t speak about the record at all this week, but we will probably talk about it before England,” he said. “If this group of players achieve that, it’ll be something nobody can take away from them. There will definitely be no lack of motivation in trying to beat England and break that record.”Gatland is certainly right that Wales will have to improve for England. Against Italy one of the few positives was the performance of the back-row trio of Aaron Wainwright, Thomas Young and Josh Navidi. The latter was named the official man of the match, but the other two were excellent.Wales started in decent enough fashion and four penalties from Biggar put them 12-0 up the only thing missing was a try. One looked certain when Biggar brilliantly collected an Aled Davies box-kick, but new captain Jonathan Davies passed long to Jonah Holmes instead of hitting Liam Williams.Holmes, hooker Elliot Dee, scrum-half Davies and Watkin were all given an opportunity by Gatland, but it was Wasps ace Young who really took his chance. Still, Wales could not pull clear as they played in fits and starts and Italy scored out of nowhere before the break.Adams’s awful clearance attempt gave them the platform and Tommaso Allan turned down three points to kick to the corner. From there a series of surges close to the line ended in flanker Braam Steyn being driven over. Allan converted, then struck a post with the last kick of the first half, but made amends with a penalty early in the second.Finally, Wales woke up. From a scrum, Aled Davies broke down the right and the ball was recycled left. Watkin, Jonathan Davies and Williams were all involved as the latter sent Adams over. Biggar converted and was then immediately replaced by Gareth Anscombe. While it gave Wales some momentum, they still could not break free.Jonathan Davies kicked ahead and had a try ruled out. Referee Mathieu Raynal consulted his television match official David Grashoff, but had to be given a pair of headphones in order to speak to him. It was amateurish stuff for a Six Nations stage.“I think there was a breakdown in communication with a technical fault,” said captain Davies. “Unfortunately we did not get the rewards for our good play, but thankfully it did not affect the result.”In the latter stages Anscombe chipped ahead and Watkin collected for his first Test try. It was one Anscombe improved, before Edoardo Padovani wrapped up the scoring from an Allan pass.Wales – who emptied their bench – must do better for England and more TMO confusion ended with Young having a score ruled out at the death. Italy, who have now lost 19 Six Nations matches in a row and not won in the competition since 2015, will take heart from the fact they did at least stay in the fight for 80 minutes.“I take no consolation from the fact we scored the same amount of tries as Wales,” said head coach Conor O’Shea. “We will never give up and keep working to try and achieve success. I am in this for the long haul of Italian rugby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bdab883d26a446d10b7c08188376ee4a3981f0d/0_118_3813_2289/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=250caf833172fa87ce2c85ae1206fce8","title":"johanna konta fed cup world group play off britain","story":"Johanna Konta has already achieved many things in her career, including being within one win of a Wimbledon final, but in terms of sheer effort, there have surely been none finer or more courageous than this.Physically exhausted and mentally spent, the Briton somehow managed to haul her body over the line and with it, secured her country a chance to reach the elite World Group of the Fed Cup. Britain’s 2-0 win over Serbia in Bath means they will now compete in a World Group II play-off in April for a chance to return to the second tier of the sport’s flagship women’s team competition for the first time since 1993.When Britain lobbied the International Tennis Federation last summer to stage a first home tie since that last appearance in the World Group 26 years ago, they did so hoping that home advantage would get them out of EuropeAfrica Group I. And through the entire week and especially when Konta needed them most, the spectators did the team proud. Konta’s 7-6 (1), 3-6, 6-2 win over Aleksandra Krunic, the world No 57, sealed the victory for Britain after Katie Boulter had beaten Ivana Jorovic 6-4, 6-3 in the opening match.This is the third consecutive year that Britain have qualified for the play-off and Britain’s captain, Anne Keothavong, paid tribute to the efforts of her players.“I’m just so proud, so, so proud,” she said. “It’s been unforgettable. The guts, the courage shown by Jo and Katie today. These girls are stronger than they realise.”All week Konta had spoken about “leaving it all out there”, putting her body and heart on the line in the quest to get them promoted. As she kneeled on all fours behind the stands before the start of the third set, her words seemed horribly prophetic. But somehow, against the odds, she recovered to win the decider.“I’m feeling pretty rubbish but it’s OK,” said Konta, who fell to her knees after her win and then needed help to get back to her feet.“The only thought I had was even if it was just me that was going to be out here, at least that would be one obstacle that was going to be a challenge for her, at least make her win it.“I just wanted to control what I could, really understand quickly my limitations and try to play within that and bring the most out of myself as possible, just with what I had, and I definitely zoned in.”Boulter had earlier given Britain the perfect start, defeating Jorovic to extend her perfect record this week to 4-0. It was a cool, impressive performance from the 22-year-old, who until Wednesday had never played a Fed Cup singles match before, but who has emerged from this week with confidence and real belief that big things are in her future.“I am close to tears right now,” Boulter said after her win over the world No 117, a year younger than her at 21. It has been a really long week. It means everything and so much more than that. I put everything on the court and have so much heart. It all just means so much to me. I wasn’t going in to this week thinking: ‘I’m going to win four matches.’ I was just putting my heart on the line and doing the best that I can, and then seeing what comes of it.”Given the effort required and having missed out in the play-off to Japan last year and to Romania in 2017, Britain will now await Tuesday’s draw with extra anticipation.“Here’s hoping for a home tie in April,” Konta said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d5e3bb66e9903e6e5ab41f945601bbcaecdf548/0_42_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e3b8f0fd0d11b1aa60675cb39474f3","title":"racings midweek green light closer with no new equine flu cases reported","story":"A midweek resumption for horse racing appears a lot closer following news on Saturday that no new positives have been found for equine influenza, after scientists had worked night and day at the Animal Health Trust to process swabs taken from hundreds of racehorses. That was especially good news for the Durham trainer Rebecca Menzies, whose horses tested clear in spite of the worrying symptoms exhibited by three of her charges.“My team here are all delighted,” she said. “My grateful thanks on behalf of ourselves and all racing fans to the huge amount of work by the British Horseracing Authority in the last few days. Undoubtedly the actions taken will ensure we are back racing as soon as possible.”Racing’s ruling body is still on course to make a decision on Monday about whether the sport can resume next week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. In the meantime, it urged caution about reading too much into the latest news, noting that results are known for only 720 swabs out of more than 2,000 received.“There are many more tests to analyse,” David Sykes, the BHA’s director of equine health, said. “The nature of the incubation period means that a negative test now doesn’t mean that a horse has never had this flu virus.”It is not unlike human flu with symptoms of coughing, nasal discharge and a fever but it’s not normally fatal, with horses generally remaining infectious for up to 10 days. It is, however, extremely contagious and explains why the Australian outbreak of 2007 lasted many months.How long is the shutdown?All race meetings have been cancelled until at least next Wednesday (13 February). Racing has not been hit in such circumstances since 2001, when the foot and mouth outbreak saw the Cheltenham Festival called off. At least 23 races will not take place in the next week.Will the Cheltenham Festival go ahead this year?All roads lead to Cheltenham for racing’s participants and punters but there is every hope the year’s most important meeting will go ahead next month given that the mass vaccination already sanctioned by the sport should ensure the action on the Turf resumes before then.What races will be affected?The big loss for the sport is the important card at Newbury scheduled for tomorrow, which included the Denman Chase, featuring last year’s Cheltenham Gold Cup winner. If racing is back on by the end of next week, key races may be rescheduled at Ascot.How will this affect punters and bookies?For that reason, the 174 stables under lockdown will remain as such for the time being. “I would advise against anyone drawing any conclusions or making any predictions based on this set of results,” Sykes said, stressing the importance of strict adherence to the ramped-up biosecurity measures in place at stables and racecourses. But he might as well have told football fans not to celebrate a goal, as the reaction was swift: Paddy Power slashed the odds against racing resuming by next Sunday from 6-4 to 1-3.“That’s really good news,” Colin Tizzard said. “As soon as these other tests come back clear, we can get back racing.” The Dorset trainer is especially hopeful the Denman Chase, cancelled along with the rest of the British action this weekend, can be restaged on Saturday, so he can get a Gold Cup prep-run into Native River.The good news came at a helpful juncture for the BHA, as a significant section of the racing community had begun to voice doubts about its lockdown policy. Nigel Twiston-Davies led the charge, calling the decision to suspend racing a massive overreaction, and others expressed similar sentiments, including fellow trainers Chris Wall, Mark Tompkins, Karl Burke and the prolific owner Marwan Koukash.Their concerns are evidently shared by Mark Johnston, who has saddled more winners than any trainer in the history of British racing. He offered lukewarm support for the BHA action, “so long as they’re saying, ‘we’re learning what we can about what we’re up against, so we can form our policy for getting back to work on Wednesday’. I think we’d have cause for complaint if they don’t get back to work on Wednesday as originally planned.“My first thought was, fine, at least they’re acting quickly. But thinking about it since, with the second wave of trainers being shut down because of a suspected case, you wonder where will this stop? As a director of an equine hospital said to me yesterday, if you apply the criteria they’ve applied to stop racing, it’s going to be very difficult to get started again.“We don’t usually go round testing our horses for flu. We have no end of mild respiratory disease, especially at this time of year among two-year-olds, and we have no end of slightly raised temperatures. It’s being suggested to me now that if you test every thoroughbred in the land, you’re always going to get the odd positive.“So what’s the endgame? We’ve got flu in the country at some level all the time, it’s not something that’s come in from abroad or dropped from Mars. We’ve not ever attempted an eradication policy, as Australia did. What we’ve got is a vaccination policy, for the horses’ welfare but also to keep the racing industry on the move when other horse industries may be stopped. And here we are, stopped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

You’ve obviously forgotten his novelty single about gnomes, his dire mime days ... and his cover of Chim Chim Cher-eeThe verdict on David Bowie’s first demo for the BBC with his mid-60s combo The Lower Third was disastrous. “The singer,” went the report, “is a Cockney type but not outstanding enough.” You can almost hear the author wiping his lorgnette disdainfully on his smoking jacket.The band’s underwhelming Kinks and Who knock-offs were woeful enough, but it was their misbegotten version of the Mary Poppins clunker Chim Chim Cher-ee that tipped BBC bosses over the edge. The cover, the report charged, “kills the song completely”.For those of us for whom Bowie remains the last word in cool, pick ’n’ mix musical genius, avant garde gender-bending and transgressive self-reinvention, there were some pretty tough moments in David Bowie: Finding Fame (BBC2). I had steeled myself for his novelty single The Laughing Gnome, with its unacceptable animation and its Bernard Cribbins-and-Benny Hill-on-helium-impersonate-Pinky-and-Perky vocals. And yet, when the back story of how it was made was related, I contemplated the middle distance with rueful mien.Then there was the miming. My God, the miming. Even the dancemime teacher Lindsay Kemp was not impressed by the dex-stretching routines Bowie inflicted on early audiences. “He was,” recalled Bowie’s one-time lover, not unpleasantly, “a lot of shit.”There was another fabulous moment in which Bowie induced members of his band Riot Squad to retool the Velvet Underground’s Waiting for the Man. They performed a sort of homosexual conga on stage while, unless I misheard, Bowie sang: “I’m just waiting for a good friendly behind.” Sweet, but probably not what Lou Reed meant at all.Later, Bowie convinced Mick Ronson, Woody Woodmandsey and Trevor Bolder, who have – I would submit – the most hetero names in the glam rock pantheon, that not only should they stretch silver satinette over their beer guts but conceal their stubble with foundation. Only then could they become the Spiders from Mars to his Ziggy Stardust. “When they realised how many girls they could pull while looking otherworldly,” recalled Bowie off-camera, “they took to it like a duck to water.”But how did the boy from suburban Bromley mutate into lubricious alligator, Major Tom, funky thigh collector, pierrot junkie, not to mention squaddie amusingly buried up to his neck in sand by Japanese captors in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence? One theory, advanced by his superbly named cousin, Kristina Amadeus, was that he was always trying to please his mum, Peggy, who came across here as a very cold fish indeed. Childhood friend Geoff MacCormack, writing to Bowie after her death, said he thought she never approved of him. “She never quite took to me either,” Bowie wrote back.I wanted to learn more about his half-brother Terry, who Bowie here recalled as a rebel outsider and the catalyst for his escape from suburbia. It would have been intriguing to hear his early song Bewlay Brothers, in which the laughing gnomes make a comeback. “Please come away, just for the day,” they chant. It is as if little David is singing to his lost sibling who, we learned, ended up hospitalised with schizophrenia, while David made a career from slipping into and out of different personae – as if applying Oscar Wilde’s principle: “Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.”The mask did slip once. Bowie’s first love was Hermione Farthingale, with whom he played in a band called Feathers. In contemporary footage, this wan ballet dancer was a dead ringer for Bowie, as if glam Narcissus had fallen for his feather-cut Echo. But like Ziggy Stardust, she had to break up the band. And worse, break David’s heart. In 1969, she left him to dance in an MGM musical called Song of Norway, while he made her a muse (“It’s a godawful small affair,” he sang on Life on Mars, “to the girl with the mousy hair”).Hermione, now a yoga and pilates instructor in Bristol, recalled him with fondness, while we heard audio of her late lover remembering: “I didn’t get over that for such a long time, it really broke me up.” Bowie was, for once, not master manipulator of sound and vision, not virtuoso of a thousand disguises, but something sweeter: unguarded boy with a broken heart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253b45952f2db5948587f092c3bfe24072fbe705/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341f061f44ed3242c3b7c53760b047ed","title":"stacey abrams democrat georgia 2020","story":"Abrams’ rebuttal to Trump’s State of the Union speech was a huge success – could she be a vice-presidential contender?On Tuesday night, the face of the Republican party was a wealthy 72-year-old white man from New York. The face of the Democratic party was a 45-year-old black woman from the deep south.After Donald Trump delivered the State of the Union address, Stacey Abrams offered her party’s rebuttal. It is usually one of the more thankless tasks in American politics, blamed for nipping many a career in the bud. Abrams succeeded in turning it into an unofficial audition for future office.Governor of Georgia? US senator? Vice-president? President? All are potentially on the table, now or in the years to come.Jean-Pierre, a veteran of Barack Obama’s election campaigns, added: “Democrats are not going to win by jumping in the mud with Donald Trump. We’re going to win by offering up policies and a different vision for the country. She did that well. Her message was spot on. We are going to be seeing a lot more of her. She’d be a strong candidate for any office. Where ever Stacey is going next, count me in.”As the first African American woman to deliver the rebuttal, Abrams offered a vivid contrast from two years ago. Then, former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear, a grey-haired white man joined by mostly white people in a diner, gave the Democratic response to Trump’s first address.Abrams spoke from a union hall in Atlanta, with a erse audience including activists, educators and labour leaders. She dismissed the recent 35-day partial government shutdown as a “stunt” engineered by Trump.“America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants – not walls,” she said.Abrams emerged as a rising star in last year’s election for governor of Georgia, a Republican stronghold where she came agonisingly close to an upset. She eventually abandoned the race without a formal concession, asserting that her opponent, Brian Kemp, used his post as secretary of state to make it harder for people of colour to vote. She has since launched an effort to combat voter suppression, highlighted in Tuesday’s address.Abrams also has compelling biography. One of six siblings who grew up in segregated Jim Crow Mississippi, she studied law at Yale and became a leader in the Georgia state legislature. She is also the award-winning author of eight romantic suspense novels, under the pen name Selena Montgomery, and tweeted this week that her favourite Doctor Who was Tom Baker.Soon after her rebuttal began, Dan Pfeiffer, the co-host of Pod Save America and former senior adviser to Obama, tweeted: “Stacey Abrams should run for President.”A subsequent New York Times article was headlined: “Stacey Abrams Isn’t Running for President. Should She Be?” Some observers believe she deserves just as much hype as Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost a Senate race in a red state, Texas, last November.There is no evidence to suggest Abrams will run, but Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is reportedly trying to persuade her to aim for Senate in 2020, sensing a chance to flip a Republican seat. Alternatively, she might wait for another chance to take on Kemp for governor, in 2022. Or she could become a formidable running mate for whoever emerges from the crowded Democratic field.Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “Clearly she’s capable of reaching out very successfully to a broad coalition and stirring up real enthusiasm in her base. She has an affirmative personality. She tells a story rooted squarely in religion and tradition. She wasn’t running against America in any way. She was firm but not angry.”Long a “red state”, Georgia could become competitive in 2020 and Abrams could give Democrats an edge. But according to the unwritten rules of American politics, her prospects depend on the gender and race of the Democratic nominee. Notwithstanding that white men have long dominated the presidency and vice-presidency, conventional wisdom suggests that certain voters are not ready for two women or two people of colour on one ticket.If, for example, Senator Kamala Harris of California is the nominee, there is “zero chance” she will choose Abrams as her running mate, Galston argued.“It would not be a strategic calculation to reach out to a broader electorate. The political logic points strongly in the opposite direction.”But in the event of a white man being the party’s standard bearer, Abrams could be the pragmatic choice as Democrats pursue a base far more erse than that of Republicans. Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “I would lay odds on it being an African American, and possibly an African American woman.”Other analysts agreed. xf, said: “Let’s say, for whatever reason, Joe Biden or Beto O’Rourke gets the nomination. They’re white and male and they’re naturally going to look for balance. Let’s say they’ve had a particularly nasty encounter with Kamala Harris in one of the primary debates: they might see Stacey Abrams as a good option.”Abrams might prefer to keep her powder dry for a re-run for governor, however.“It would make the most sense for her,” Sabato said. “She came so close and Brian Kemp is not impressive. In four years, Georgia will have evolved further: it used to be red but is going purple.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b64b63a28ee91190b6b29180a41d20d7659843a/0_190_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f5dd6957d0607e383e5d3ec4312b691","title":"asia bibi pakistani authorities barring her from leaving friend says","story":"Labourer whose blasphemy death sentence was overturned has been transferred to KarachiPakistani authorities have moved Asia Bibi, a Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy charges, to a new “secure area” and are barring her from leaving the country, a close friend and rights campaigner has claimed.Bibi, who spent eight years on death row, was transferred from a location near the capital to a house in the southern port city of Karachi, her friend Aman Ullah told the Associated Press. She and her husband are locked in a single room in a house where the door opens only “at food times”, he added.Canada has offered her asylum and she wants to join her daughters there. Pakistani authorities have said she is free to travel, but Bibi, 54, says she is being prevented from going.“She has no indication of when she will leave,” said Ullah, who added that Bibi was frightened and frustrated. “They are not telling her why she cannot leave.” He spoke to her by telephone, after the threats from extremists angered by his assistance to Bibi forced him to flee the country on Friday.Ullah has been liaising with diplomats over the case, and he says they were told Bibi’s departure would only come “in the medium-term”.Publicly, Pakistani authorities insist that Bibi is free both inside Pakistan, and to leave it. “She is living with her family and given requisite security for safety,” the information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, told the AP in an email.He said the government was responsible for taking “all possible measures” to protect her and her family, adding that “she is a free citizen after her release from jail and can move anywhere in Pakistan or abroad.”Violent Islamists have threatened to track her down and kill her, some even suggesting that they will pursue her abroad if she leaves.A farm labourer, Bibi was sentenced to death in 2010 in what swiftly became Pakistan’s most infamous blasphemy case. She had been accused by Muslim villagers of insulting the prophet Muhammad in a row over a cup of water. She always insisted she was innocent.Blasphemy is a highly inflammatory issue in Pakistan, where even unproven accusations of insulting Islam can spark lynchings. Human rights activists say blasphemy charges are frequently used to settle personal scores.After the supreme court overturned Bibi’s conviction, cities across Pakistan were paralysed for several days by violent demonstrations with enraged extremists calling for her beheading.In a deal to end the violence, the government, led by the prime minister, Imran Khan, struck a deal allowing the petition seeking an appeal against the supreme court’s judgment. Khan was accused of capitulating to the extremists’ demands.In January the supreme court rejected that challenge to their October ruling at the time it was thought Bibi could leave the country within hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1da0fcede3ee25bd6a77f017e045d66b7564ce/0_138_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1045c016402f7a926776cc982faf822","title":"thai princess ubolratana ends campaign prime minister","story":"Twenty-four hours of high drama in Thai politics ended abruptly on Saturday when a party that nominated a princess to run for prime minister ended her brief candidacy. The move came after her brother, Thailand’s king, attacked the candidacy as unconstitutional.The Thai Raksa Chart (Save the Nation) party swore loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn in a statement issued after his late-night intervention. It also expressed gratitude to Princess Ubolratana Mahidol for her kindness toward the party.Ubolratana’s vanishingly brief political career electrified Thailand. She would have represented a party allied to the exiled tycoon and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and the combination of his vast popular support and her royal pedigree made her an instant frontrunner.She could potentially have bridged the fault line that has caused more than a decade of political turmoil in Thailand between the populist “red shirts”, who back Thaksin, and the conservative, royalist “yellow shirts” aligned with the military.Traditionally, the monarchy, one of the most revered institutions in Thailand, has stayed above the political fray except in moments of crisis. So when Ubolratana’s extraordinary candidacy was announced, analysts assumed that she had her brother’s tacit approval.The two siblings are believed to be quite close, and when she married an American in the 1970s, the princess had been forced to renounce her royal titles – something she said now made her eligible to run for office.But in a sharply worded late-night statement on Friday, the king denounced her candidacy, effectively putting an end to it. “Even though she relinquished her title according to royal laws ... she still retains her status and position as a member of the Chakri dynasty,” he said.“Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is an act that conflicts with the country’s traditions, customs, and culture, and therefore considered highly inappropriate.”The next morning, the Thai Raksa Chart party confirmed that Ubolratana’s hours-long run for office was over. The princess later posted a statement on Instagram thanking people for their support, without directly mentioning her brother.Thaksin or his allies have won every national election since 2001, buoyed by support for policies including universal healthcare, despite repeated efforts to stamp out his influence. He was ousted in a 2006 coup, and when the military stepped in again five years ago, it was to remove a government led by his sister.The election on 24 March will be Thailand’s first since the 2014 military coup. the frontrunner is Prayut Chan-o-cha, the leader of the coup and head of the ruling military junta, who says he is standing to maintain peace and order. After repeatedly delaying elections and tightening controls on opposition parties, he had been widely expected to return as prime minister.Ubolratana’s unconventional foray into politics came after decades of defying expectations. The eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 after a 70-year reign, she gave up her royal title when she married Peter Ladd Jensen, a US citizen and fellow student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.After having three children, they orced and she moved back to Thailand where she began a second life as an unusually accessible royal, posting regularly on Instagram. In addition to acting and singing, she carries out charity work, including leading an anti-drugs campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc018a94316506e38b9ae7ea40f54164428be72/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c596ff3d130f91739ec8d792a56ca3da","title":"who really are the gilets jaunes","story":"The gilets jaunes movement is the longest-running protest in France since the second world war. It has lasted for 13 weeks but has mobilised fully for only 13 days – all of them Saturdays.In the protesters’ own eyes, this is not a protest. It is an insurrection which happens mostly at the weekends. Through a series of Saturday putsches, the yellow vests hope not merely to bring down President Emmanuel Macron but to rip up the constitution of the Fifth Republic and replace representative democracy with popular government. Their support, always limited compared with previous French rebellions, is waning. They will not give up easily or soon. They are mostly peaceful, but acts and words of great violence are committed and spoken.There is no simple explanation for the gilets jaunes. It is not a monolithic, single-minded movement. It has no leadership structure, no single, accepted programme of demands. That’s what makes it fascinating. And worrying.In May last year, a young businesswoman of French West Indian origin, Priscillia Ludosky, 31, placed a petition online complaining about the high cost of petrol and diesel in France. Reaction – practically nothing. Ludosky is a calm young woman with dreadlocks who runs her own cosmetics business from home. She is an unlikely pioneer for a populist movement which is sometimes accused of being racist and far right (as parts of it undoubtedly are).In October she was contacted by Eric Drouet, a 33-year-old lorry driver, who teamed up with her to promote her original petition. Drouet is a car fanatic, a “petrol head”, but also someone with extremist political tendencies. He is now, many weeks later, probably the most influential figure in the gilets jaunes.There is confusion in France about whether he should be seen as far right or far left. Drouet’s original motivation may well have been his car obsession rather than his politics. Pre-gilets jaunes, he was a loud-mouthed young man more likely to watch Top Gear than to read Das Kapital or Mein Kampf.By the time he intervened, petrol prices were spiking because of a rise in world oil prices. Ludosky’s original petition exploded online, attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures.It was Drouet, from Melun in the brie cheese country east of Paris, who thought of the idea of a nationwide protest against fuel taxes on 17 November. Someone else had the brilliant PR idea of dressing everyone up in the yellow hi-vis vests that French motorists must by law carry in their cars. Petrol prices rapidly set alight other grievances in rural and outer suburban France, some concrete, some more existential: a lack of public services, the high cost of living, a new tax on some pensions, the fact that Macron had partially abolished a tax on wealth. No one should underestimate the importance of a decision last July to reduce the two-lane speed limit in France from 90kph to 80kph.This aroused a long-simmering belief in “peripheral France” that the countryside and outer suburbs are somehow subsidising the insolent success of the cities. Speeding fines, in this rural view, are just another way of taxing ploucs or pecnos – yokels or rednecks. There is also a belief that lower and middle France is taxed unfairly in favour of the rich.Both beliefs are factually untrue. If anything, the rich subsidise the public services of the poor and lower-middle. The metropolitan areas subsidise peripheral France.But it is true that energy, life and local sources of wealth have been sucked out of large swathes of France in recent decades – as they have in parts of Britain or the United States. All this adds up to an existential conviction that peripheral France is not only being left behind but mocked and cheated by those who are forging ahead. I believe that this resentment – a sense of being slighted or ignored or despised or abandoned or humiliated – explains the yellow-vest movement more than any particular grievance.The first day of action on 17 November mobilised 283,000 people across France. This figure has never been reached since. It was impressive but fell well below the numbers that have turned out for other social protests in the last 20 years. Its significance was that it took place not just in cities but also in small towns and on almost every local roundabout. Like the Tour de France, it was a national event which came “down your way”.People who had previously felt powerless felt abruptly powerful because they could hold up cars and lorries at a roundabout. People who had been invisible became highly visible in their hi-vis vests.Here is our second paradox. The gilets jaunes are an internet-spawned and driven movement. They could not have existed before Facebook existed. But their attraction is that they are also something tangible, a social club as well as a social protest.The gilets jaunes were brought to a white-heat pitch of anger by the halls of facing mirrors of “anger groups” online. But they also allowed people to escape from the isolation of their terminals or smartphones to come together and do things.The 17 November protests – Act One – were mostly peaceful. There was little violence, except a few scuffles with police in Paris and with motorists on blocked roundabouts. The government stood back and allowed the protests to happen, even though the gilets jaunes deliberately defied the law which demands advance permissions for large gatherings.It is important to remember this when gilets jaunes and Russian news sites allege that Macron has tried to “suppress” the movement.On 24 November, Act Two of the movement, there was some violence in Paris. Police responded robustly to being attacked by a militant fringe of protesters on the Champs-Élysées. There were several serious injuries from police weapons. This was treated on GJ sites as deliberate police violence and repression, stoking tempers for the next weekend.On 1 December, Act Three, I was out on streets of Paris from early morning. I happen to live near the Arc de Triomphe, and when I left my building at 9am I walked out into the middle of a street battle. A number of yellow vests – not just hard left and right militants but rural or provincial disaffected men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s – attacked police from early morning.The Arc de Triomphe was tagged with graffiti. Police were pelted with acid, paint, iron bolts, stones and bottles. Buildings around the Étoile were set briefly alight. A mob surged down the Avenue Kléber, overturning and burning cars and smashing bank, shop and restaurant windows.Before the next Saturday – Act Four on 8 December – there were dark reports that there would be an insurrection, using live weapons and explosives. Macron, shaken, visited the Élysée nuclear bunker to make sure there was a place that he could take refuge. In the event, 8 December was again a violent day – not just in Paris but in several cities. It was not the feared revolution. The violence this time was mostly provoked by militia of the hard right and hard left. Some “ordinary” GJs waded in. Police were more aggressive in their response.Since then there have been nine further Acts or Saturday putsches, some more violent than others, some better supported than others. Violence has switched from Paris for the most part to provincial cities, especially Toulouse, Bordeaux, Caen, Rouen and Rennes. The numbers taking part have fallen to around 60,000.There has been no systematic attempt to repress protest. But the police’s so-called defensive weapons – rubber bullets and stun grenades – have become a serious problem that the government has been too slow to recognise. Seventeen eyes and four hands have been lost so far. That is unacceptable, whoever is initially responsible for the violence.Is this just the French being the French? Not really. It’s true that protest goes to the street in France more rapidly than in almost any other democratic country. There is a default position in the country that social demands will not be taken seriously without street demos, and demos will not be taken seriously without a dose of violence.But there is also something very un-French about the gilets jaunes movement. It has, first of all, broken all the unspoken and spoken rules of French manifestations. Protests are usually choreographed within certain limits, with agreed venues and routes and marshals. Riots happen but they are predictable riots.The gilets jaunes refused from the beginning to be bound by any of these rules, although this is now changing. The movement, supposedly peaceful, allowed its own violent fringe as well as opportunist, urban, state-hating militia of hard right and hard left to take over.The violence is not limited to the Saturdays-only protests in French cities. There have been scores of arson and other attacks on the offices of MPs who support Macron. There have been attacks on motorways toll-booths, newspapers and radio stations. A starred restaurant whose boss criticised the gilets jaunes was burned. Town halls, prefectures and other public buildings have been vandalised. The gilets jaunes are also un-French – or at least atypical – because they have not come from the usual or expected sources of protest: unions, farmers, students, the multi-racial banlieues. They come from a section of French society that is usually invisible, permanently grumpy but little engaged in politics.I mean rural, non-farming France, small town France, outer suburban France. I mean many people who have not voted for years, as well as many who have voted hard right or hard left.Gilets jaunes do include people at the bottom of society, the unemployed, the marginalised, but more typically they are people who are above the bottom but think that they should be doing better. They are people with low-paid jobs or pensioners or artisans or small business people or technicians or people at the lower level of the caring professions.This mixture of supporters explains in part the heterogenous character and demands of the movement, which point both left and right, to higher welfare payments and pensions but also to lower taxes, to less state and more state. There is no coherent ideology, even a refusal of ideology.Some see this as a camouflage for a movement whose heart beats on the far right. But many of the usual far-right hot topics – migration, Islam, abortion, gay marriage, Europe – are not the first things that you hear on the lips of gilets jaunes.What are the sources of grievance and how justified are they? Here it is difficult to prise apart French and un-French elements.The words you hear most often are mépris and ras le bol. Mépris means contempt. Gilets jaunes are convinced or have been convinced that the little or middling people like them are held in contempt by the trendy, rich, globally-oriented people of successful metropolitan France.That’s why, I think, Macron has sparked such anger and hatred: not so much for what he has done in the past 20 months but for what he represents and some of the things he has said. He typifies the kind of person that GJs didn’t like even before they were GJs or before there was Macron.He is the embodiment of the rich, clever, self-replicating people from the governing classes who’ve been to the finishing schools of the governing elite and think they know everything.And so to the second word or phrase you hear: ras le bol, which means sick to the teeth. It conveys a sense of having been pushed to the breaking point. In my experience, French people almost always have a sense of ras le bol about something or other. But the white-hot anger of the GJ movement is something new and different. It can only be explained, I think, by the silos of facing mirrors of social media sites, which fill heads with exaggerated versions of real grievances blended with complete bullshit.“France has been sold to the UN” “Alsace has been given back to Germany” “Politicians are living high on the hog – if we sweep them away, we can have lower taxes and higher welfare payments” “Brigitte Macron, as first lady, earns €550,000 a year from the state”. Actually she earns, nothing, zero, rien.This nonsense is always accompanied, as it often is in the United States and Britain, by a message telling you that the mainstream media is lying. Thus suspicion of the media, already high, is cranked to the point where journalists, newspapers and radio stations have become targets for GJ violence.The gilets jaunes rapidly moved from a protest movement with specific demands to a revolutionary movement of unlikely revolutionaries. The view in much of the foreign media is that these are anti-Macron protests. And they are. But they go way beyond him and call for the sluicing out of the entire political class, left and right, even hard left and hard right, to be replaced by a bottom-up, direct democracy of permanent popular decisions by referendums.Thus we have a revolution which did not just start on the internet and Facebook but wants to use the internet to impose a new form of government and yet is at the same time anti-globalist and nostalgic for a simpler, more traditional kind of France. Yet another paradox.The movement is now splitting. Some gilets jaunes have decided to enter the mainstream political system to try to reform it or destroy it from the inside. Three rival GJ lists, broadly left, right and centrist, are being prepared for the European elections in May.An extraordinary diplomatic row exploded last week when the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, arrived unannounced in the south Paris suburbs for a photo opportunity with one of these electoral lists.France withdrew its ambassador from Rome in protest. It emerged that Di Maio had been invited by Christophe Chalençon, a gilets jaunes figure with far-right connections, not by the leader of the list, Ingrid Levavasseur. She described both Di Maio and Chalençon as “sharks”.All of this may help Macron. He is already recovering strongly in the opinion polls as well-heeled, urban France turns to him to save them from yellow chaos. He has made €10bn of concessions to motorists and the low-paid. He has started a “great national debate” in hundreds of village and town meetings.Even one yellow vest list in the European elections will take votes from Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s far-left La France Insoumise. For Macron’s party to top the European poll in France would be a “mid-term” triumph.There is talk of Emmanuel Macron calling a referendum on the same day as the EU poll on 26May to take further wind from the sails of the gilets jaunes. This is probably a silly idea. Senior ministers are campaigning against it.If the referendum asks marginal questions – ie should there be fewer French MPs? – it will seem like a betrayal of the promise of Macron’s “great debate”. If it asks explosive questions – should Macron resign? Should he push ahead with his state-shrinking reform programme? – the results could be catastrophic for him.LeVavasseur, an auxiliary nurse from Normandy, is one of the more thoughtful gilets jaunes (and therefore detested by many others). She is leading one of the GJ lists in the European elections. Asked to sum up yellow-vest demands in a single sentence, she said: “That we should feel recognised and valued.”The anger of the gilets jaunes is understandable. What is scary is their fury. Where does that come from? What explains the radicalisation of home carers and garage mechanics in small towns who don’t understand the basics of how their own country’s political and tax system works but want to tear them both down?That fury has many sources but its depth and strength can only be explained by the compound or viral effect of social media. The gilets jaunes are a French phenomenon and a French crisis.They also point to a wider, existential crisis for 21st-century democracies.This article is adapted from a talk given to a conference of the Brussels European Employee Relations Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a02903613f866ffcb46584689d8ecf07cad8c23/0_177_4410_2646/master/4410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d39b3de7f0c72e22d8689a4bfcdd1e7","title":"chinas treatment of uighurs is embarrassment for humanity says turkey","story":"Ankara calls for UN to act on ‘human tragedy’ of re-education of the Turkic-speaking minority in Xinjiang provinceTurkey has condemned China’s treatment of its Muslim ethnic Uighur people as “a great embarrassment for humanity”, adding to rights groups’ recent criticism over mass detentions of the Turkic-speaking minority.“The systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity,” Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement.Aksoy also said Turkey had learned of the “tragic” death in custody on Saturday of Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit.“We’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his compositions, died in the second year of his imprisonment,” he said.“This tragic incident has further strengthened the Turkish public’s reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang region.”The north-west Xinjiang region of China, where most Uighurs live, has been under heavy police surveillance in recent years, after violent inter-ethnic tensions.Nearly one million Uighurs and other Turkic language-speaking minorities in China have reportedly been held in re-education camps, according to a UN panel of experts.Beijing says the “vocational education centres” help people steer clear of terrorism and allow them to be reintegrated into society.But critics say China is seeking to assimilate Xinjiang’s minority population and suppress religious and cultural practices that conflict with communist ideology and the dominant Han culture.“It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks – who are exposed to arbitrary arrests – are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centres and prisons,” Aksoy said in the Turkish foreign ministry statement. “Uighurs who are not detained in the camps are also under great pressure,” he added.Turkey called on the international community and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, “to take effective steps to end the human tragedy in Xinjiang region”.Most mainly Muslim countries have not been vocal on the issue, not criticising the government in China, which is an important trading partner."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3788317.1549719885!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac corroding public life in ireland says former hse chief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien: ‘I’m worried that without intervention we could be looking at the last generation of family doctors.’ File photograph: Cyril Byrne  The Former HSE director general Tony O’Brien has accused the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of “corroding public life in Ireland” and chasing “every passing controversy”.Speaking on RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show on Saturday morning, the former HSE head, who stepped down from his position in May 2018, accused the PAC of creating a “culture of bullying” and that they “simply pay no respect to iniduals”.“They’re creating a culture in which the easiest way to survive as a public servant is never to do anything. They’re rewarding people for taking measured and controlled risks. Whatever you do as far as the PAC is concerned it’s wrong . . . they’re creating a system where people do not want to come in to the public service anymore.“I believe the culture they have developed is doing real harm to public service in Ireland. I’m concerned if this carries on it will do real damage.”Asked to comment on calls for Minister for Health Simon Harris to step down from office over the cost overruns at the national children’s hospital, Mr O’Brien advised that the Government wait for the findings of the Price WaterhouseCoopers (PwC) review into the controversy rather than adding to the current “showboating” around it.“In a few weeks time there will be an objective report. I would argue it’s better to have that report than unseemly rush for headlines and airtime. . .It isn’t what the country needs.”Mr O’Brien said he did not believe “animosity” existed between the Department of Health and the HSE but that there was “confusion around accountability” and “duplication of activities”. Noting that he was appointed as HSE director at a time when the health service was set to be abolished within two years, he said there was always a risk that “things would fall between the cracks” as long as the body continued.Children’s hospital and nurses’ strikeHe argued that he never knew of the overrun in costs of the national children’s hospital as he had stepped down from his position in May 2018, a month before the HSE was told that the project was facing cost challenges. “My working presumption is that this was brought to the oversight board in June because that’s when it became a live issue,” he said. “If it had been a big issue in April I’m confident they would have brought it to the board in April.”Commenting on the ongoing dispute around nurses’ pay and conditions, Mr O’Brien said he held “pride” in the “tremendous work” of nurses but that the health service was the “wrong shape” and that the nurses were continuing to strike because no “meaningful engagement” had been offered by the HSE.He said there had been very little momentum in the implementation of the SláinteCare plan and warned of “a significant problem” in the future around the State’s general practitioner (GP) services. “Our system is upside down, for years we’ve prioritised hospitals over primary care. I’m concerned that the most important medical relationship, which is our GP, is not necessarily going to be a relationship that people have in the future. I’m worried that without intervention we could be looking at the last generation of family doctors. And if we lose family doctors we’re going to lose the game.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Psychiatric Nurses Association and INMO attending talks on Saturday in bid to avert further strikesIrish funding in fight to end AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria rises to \u0026euro45 millionClare Bailey says Brexit and lack of progress on equality impacting lives across NorthTony O\u0026rsquoBrien accuses Public Accounts Committee of creating a \u0026lsquoculture of bullying\u0026rsquoSuspect (42) being questioned over paramilitary-style shooting in Creggan area of cityConstruction inflation on brownfield city-centre sites higher than on greenfield sitesTaoiseach says he understands taxpayers \u0026lsquovery annoyed\u0026rsquo about cost overrunCourt told man made threats to kill after mother refused to let drug addict friend stayNumber of past alleged abusers identified by Scouting Ireland increases to 237Private dinner meeting described as \u0026lsquowarm\u0026rsquo by aides also focused on stalled NI assemblyStudent debate whether to ban imports from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territoryEvent on the future of European democracy hears concern in advance of electionsTwo passengers taken to University Hospital LimerickMan (35) left with \u0026lsquopotentially life-changing injury\u0026rsquo following attack on Friday eveningLabelling of foreign chicken \u0026lsquomade in Wicklow\u0026rsquo is lawful, says Food Safety AuthorityLabour Court talks between INMO and health managers to continue on SaturdaySettlement agreed after claim law required assessment within 3 months of application"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3788316.1549731855!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tens of thousands rally in support of nurses in dublin","story":" Tens of thousands of people attended a rally in Dublin city centre in support of the nurses’ campaign for pay improvements to tackle recruitment and retention issues.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople attend a rally in support of striking nurses in Dublin city centre on Saturday. Photograph: Alan BetsonTens of thousands of people attended a rally in Dublin city centre in support of the nurses’ campaign for improved pay and for the health service to tackle recruitment and retention issues.Over 40,000 members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) are set to go on strike for three days in the coming week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.Nurses and their families and supporters gathered at Parnell Square from noon and began marching down O’Connell Street led by members of the Dublin Fire Brigade Pipe Band at about 12.30, chanting and carrying trade union banners.Noreen Galvin, a clinical nurse manager based in Tullamore Hospital, said she had come to Dublin to support the protest because it was about the future of the nursing profession.“It’s about recruitment, it’s about retention. In my unit the vast majority of nurses are in their 40s and 50s. The 20 and the 30-year-olds they are not here, they’re not in Ireland. One of my colleagues, her daughter qualified last year. Twenty of them are in London and around the world. So it is about safe staffing, it is about safe patient care. Every day procedures are cancelled because there aren’t enough nurses.”Holding a placard declaring himself a lung transplant patient supporting the nurses, Brendan Larkin from Ballybrack in Dublin said he had received “excellent” care from them. He said he had also been supporting the nurses on the various picket lines outside hospitals and would continue to do so next week. “To see the nurses over in Australia with the placards saying they want to come home…to be honest with you I’m feeling very emotional, especially when you see the amount of people here.”Anne Hickey, a retired public health nurse, said “understaffing was a huge issue” and that nurses were just leaving the profession. Freddie Trevaskis-Hoskin, said he was a lifelong patient with a rare syndrome that required major surgery every couple of years and minor surgery “often”.“I was in for minor surgery yesterday and because of this I have a lot of experience with how overrun the nurses in our country are and what a difficult job it is even at the best of times. If you are trying to care for people in those extreme situations, even if you are well paid and get normal working hours, it’s an extraordinarily stressful life to live,” he said.The protest moved down Eden Quay and across the Liffey, up Lombard Street and Westland Row to Merrion Street where a stage was erected for speakers in front of Government Buildings.Addressing the huge crowd, INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that in 2019 there were no further arguments left to deny nurses and midwives equal pay.“Equal pay for nurses with other graduates is something we have strived for, is something that we seek and it’s something that we intend to get, because without it, nursing and midwifery will still be considered a little bit of a vocation and a little bit of ‘girls going to work’ and girls just not having the right to stand up for themselves.”Ms Ní Sheaghdha said nurses were not denying there were problems with the economic fabric of the State or that the economic future of the country was important.But she said they did not believe that our social fabric was secondary and that our public health service was something that should be sacrificed in a recession.Ms Ní Sheaghdha said she was returning to the Labour Court on Saturday afternoon, where the INMO has been in talks with health managers.INMO president Martina Harkin-Kelly said that when she started nursing in 1983, there were cutbacks and the “exoduses” of nurses in the 80s and 90s. Nurses and midwives had not just taken a hit through “poor pay”. They had also been “stripped” any allowances and any extra pay that they had. A number of nurses told the crowd of how they were struggling in their daily jobs because of understaffng and they said they had been overwhelmed by public support during their strike in recent weeks. The Psychiatric Nurses Association on Friday escalated its campaign of industrial action over pay and staffing issues and announced three further 24-hour work stoppages for the week after next.Peter Hughes, general secretary of the union, told the crowds at the protest on Saturday that by 2021, 34 per cent of psychiatric nurses in the State would be eligible for retirement. He also said that asome 3,000 children were on waiting lists for first-time mental health assessments and that this was “a national disgrace”.He said the recruitment and retention crisis in the mental health services was “impacting daily on the quality of care and the access to services for patients and service users”. The PNA said it had not been invited to attend talks at the Labour Court on Friday between the INMO and public service management aimed at finding a resolution to the current dispute.Talks between public service management and the INMO will resume at 3.30pm on Saturday and a meeting with the PNA will commence at 5.30pm.On Friday the HSE formally wrote to the Government expressing concern over patient safety issues in the event of the planned three days of strikes by nurses going ahead in the coming week."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit an idiot s guide to the united kingdom leaving the european union","story":"Brexit basicsBrexit - A combination of the word Britain and exit was coined in 2012 to describe the idea of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe SDLP at a special closed conference in Newry on Saturday voted by 121 votes to 53 to endorse the recently announced partnership with Fianna Fáil.Delegates at the conference in the Canal Court Hotel in Newry voted on two motions with the party leader Colum Eastwood who proposed the motion supporting the alliance with Fianna Fáil carrying the day with 121 votes or 70 per cent of the poll.A total of 53 delegates supported the counter proposal from the SDLP’s Lurgan branch. That motion affirmed the party’s “long established relationships with Fine Gael and Labour as well as Fianna Fáil” and called on the leadership to “continue to engage other parties of democratic Ireland in a policy focussed partnership addressing reconciliation between our island’s main traditions, as well as economic, social and cultural matters and the restoration of the Good Friday institutions”.The main driver of the Lurgan motion was Claire Hanna, notwithstanding that she is Assembly member for South Belfast. SDLP grandee and former minister Brid Rodgers, who is from Lurgan, also spoke against the partnership.It is understood that Ms Hanna was the only one of the party’s 12 MLAs to vote against the link-up with Fianna Fáil. She said she would not be resigning from the party.TogetherMr Eastwood, welcoming the outcome, said party members left the conference room together. “We are going to face the council elections and any other elections that might come our way as one team. We are looking forward to developing a partnership with Fianna Fáil but we are also very, very committed to fighting for the people of the North and the whole of this country,” he said.“We are faced with a very real challenge with Brexit coming down the tracks. We have had no government in this place for more than two years. It is about time that our politics got back on track. This party, every single one of us is totally committed to doing that job, and we look forward to doing it together,” added Mr Eastwood.He said it was not easy when people held different views but that was the democratic history of the SDLP.Asked did the vote represent the first step leading to a merger with Fianna Fáil Mr Eastwood replied, “What we have agreed today is a policy partnership to try to deal with the very real problems – the crises that are in our politics today – that’s what people will see. It is two parties working together for the betterment of this country.“That is what we are committed to, that is what we have agreed, that is what we have a mandate for, and that is all that we are doing.”Mr Eastwood said the SDLP realised it had a “huge challenge” in restoring party fortunes. “But I think people understand in Northern Ireland that politics does better, that people do better when the SDLP do well. We are not pretending this is a quick fix. We are not talking about building for the next election, we are talking about building for the next generation,” he said.“That is the work that we are recommitting to today. It is a hard slog. It will be a lot of hard work,” he added. “It is time to see a change. We are committed to making that change, we are looking forward to rolling our sleeves up, to getting round the doors and to working together to make sure we can see that happen,” added Mr Eastwood.South Belfast MLA Ms Hanna said she entered the conference, which began at 11am, believing an exclusive relationship with Fianna Fáil was a bad idea and at the end of the conference, at 4.30pm, she had not changed her mind. She said the meeting was “inspiring” in that it prompted delegates from the youth generation to the founders of the party to air their views.Party policyMs Hanna said she understood the problems facing the party but still opposed the outcome. She hoped Mr Eastwood would have heard “the wide range of positive alternatives” from the floor and articulate some of them in future party policy.Ms Hanna said she would be remaining on as an SDLP member. “We are all together in this party and we all have elections to fight, and we will do that,” she said. Ms Hanna was less explicit when asked would she stay if ultimately the party merged with Fianna Fáil although she recently said she could not be a member of Fianna Fáil.The Irish Labour party, which Ms Hanna and others in the party support, said it was disappointed by the result. “It remains our view that this move represents a precursor to a full merger. We also note that 30 per cent of delegates opposed the leadership motion,” it added.In Europe the SDLP is affiliated to the Party of European Socialists. Labour appeared to suggest that this formal relationship now could be challenged.It said, “The consequences of the partnership decision will now be carefully considered by the Labour party in the coming weeks, and in consultation with our colleagues in the Party of European Socialists.”“The Labour party remains committed to supporting those who wish to maintain Labour politics and the social democratic tradition in Northern Ireland,” its statement added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3787386.1549667904!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach and may discuss brexit overall state of play in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK prime minister Theresa May in Farmleigh House, Dublin Photograph: AFPMaxwellsGetty Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May discussed Brexit and Northern Ireland at a private dinner in Farmleigh House in Dublin last night at an occasion described by aides as “warm”, in contrast to some of their previous meetings.Irish sources said that Mr Varadkar and Mrs May discussed the continuing absence of an administration in the North and also the “overall state of play” on Brexit, but were tight-lipped about any conclusions.Irish officials stressed that the dinner in no way involved “negotiations” on Brexit or the backstop, stressing that negotiations take place in Brussels between the EU’s negotiating team led by Michel Barnier and the UK government team.The dinner was also attended by senior officials from Downing St, including the prime minister’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell and chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins.The Taoiseach’s chief of staff Brian Murphy, top Brexit official John Callinan and the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach Martin Fraser, also attended, Government Buildings said.The Attorney General Seamus Woulfe also met his British counterpart Geoffrey Cox in Dublin yesterday.Common travel areaBritish reports suggested that they discussed the backstop, but Irish government sources disputed this, saying that the talks focussed on the arrangements for the common travel area between the two jurisdictions.“They met to compare notes on a number of issues including the work of their respective departments,” a spokesman said,Officials in Dublin had played down expectations for the meeting, which was held at Downing St’s request and said that the two leaders would discuss the prospects for a resuscitation of the power-sharing institutions in Stormont, as well as Brexit issues.Earlier speaking in Belfast where he was holding a series of meetings with the Northern parties, Mr Varadkar said it was “not a day for negotiations” but that it was an opportunity to “share perspectives”.Mrs May has said that she is seeking legally binding changes to the backstop previously agreed as part of the Withdrawal Treaty in order to secure support for a deal which would enable an agreed exit from the EU at the end of next month.EU leaders have signalled a willingness to provide assurances and commitments about the temporary nature of the backstop in the non-legally binding political declaration which will accompany the withdrawal treaty, but have said the treaty itself – including the backstop – is not open for renegotiation.The Dublin visit comes at the end of a week of shuttle diplomacy in the EU with visits to Brussels by both the Taoiseach and Mrs May to discuss Brexit issues with the leaders of the EU institutions.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ReutersFrancois LenoirA crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May’s hand on Brexit is set to be delayed until the end of the month or even later, it has emerged.Under the timetable agreed by the government, the British prime minister must either present a revised Brexit deal to the commons next Thursday, which appears unlikely to happen, or else table a motion to which MPs can add amendments.In a similar process just over a week ago, the commons supported Mrs May’s attempt to renegotiate the Irish backstop but voted down amendments tabled by cross-party alliances of Brexit-sceptic MPs that would have extended article 50 and given parliament more control.It had been expected the MPs would try again on Thursday if Mrs May did not return with a deal. But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels.“The Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,” the source said. A Bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure might nonetheless be published next week, they said.“There’s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don’t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,” the source said. “There is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it’s a question of how to proceed and when.The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the : “Our position is that the ball is in the PM’s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.”Any further delay would be contingent on Mrs May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: “Parliament has to have its say.”It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which Mrs May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards March 29th.After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European Council president Donald Tusk mentioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, Mrs May was meeting the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday night.Mrs May has yet to formally respond to Mr Corbyn’s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union.Separately, Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage announced on Friday that he would stand as a candidate for a new “Brexit Party” to contest European Parliament elections if Britain’s departure from the EU is delayed past March 29th.“The party was founded with my full support and with the intention of fighting the European elections on May 23rd if Brexit has not been delivered by then,” the former Ukip leader wrote in an opinion piece published by the Daily . – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3786910.1549637301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland and belfast agreement secure us support ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney (centre) with members of the Friends of Ireland caucus inside the Ways and Means committee room in the US Capitol building in Washington on Thursday. Left, Irish ambassador to the US Dan Mulhall and, right, committee chairman Richard Neal. Photograph: Marty KatzWithin the wood-panelled walls of the Ways and Means committee room, on the second floor of the United States Capitol building, sits a sculpture of Winston Churchill.The statuette was presented to Congress by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, a mark of the “special relationship” between the two countries.High on the wall, overseeing the work of the committee, is a portrait of Thomas Fitzsimons, its first chairman. Born in Ireland in 1741, he emigrated to Philadelphia and became a leading figure in the war against Britain, going on to build a successful political career.The presence of the two historical figures gave a fitting context to this week’s meetings between Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Irish-American figures in the US capital.On Thursday, Richard Neal, the chair of the Ways and Means committee, hosted Coveney along with members of the Friends of Ireland caucus and the committee in the meeting room. On the agenda was Brexit.Concern among Irish-Americans about the potential impact of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement have spilled out into the open in recent weeks.Following congressman Brendan Boyle’s introduction of a resolution to Congress opposing the imposition of a hard border in Ireland last week, 40 senior Irish-Americans, including five former US ambassadors, wrote to prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, outlining their alarm at the direction of Brexit.On Wednesday, at a reception to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Neal and Republican congressman Peter King warned that Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the US after Brexit could be on the rocks if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.“If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained. What influence we have, we will use it,” King said.Of more concern to London will be Neal’s warning that concerns about the Belfast Agreement will “weigh on his mind” as the committee considers a future trade deal.As the chair of the Ways and Means committee, Neal, who was centrally involved in the Belfast Agreement 20 years ago, will have significant influence over the shape of any future US-UK trade agreement.The committee’s quaint-sounding name belies its power. It is one of the most powerful committees in Congress, overseeing financial and taxation matters including trade.This week, for example, it held its first hearing on getting access to presidential tax returns – a major source of concern for president Donald Trump.Strong Irish diasporaAs well as his meetings with Congress, Coveney also spoke to senior figures within the Trump administration this week including secretary of state Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, ensuring that Ireland’s concerns are understood within the administration.Britain remains a significant player in Washington with a formidable diplomatic presence and military might that cannot be underestimated. But Ireland continues to benefit from a strong diaspora and powerful Irish-American lobby.Nonetheless the future of the Irish-American lobby cannot be taken for granted, given the slowdown in Irish emigration to the US in recent decades.That is one reason why the Tánaiste this week launched the government’s new Americas strategy, part of the Department of Foreign Affairs’s “Global Ireland” drive. Its aim is to inject a “new dynamism and ambition” into Ireland’s relationship with the US.This involves beefing up Ireland’s presence in locations as erse as Miami, Los Angeles, and Austin, increasing the number of high-level government visits to the US to between 30 and 40 a year, and launching a new diaspora policy with particular emphasis on young people.Of perhaps most interest is the promise to “advance a strong, enduring partnership between the European Union and the United States”.Post-Brexit, Ireland will be an important pro-US voice around the EU table, particularly in terms of taxation, regulation and the digital economy. Ireland and the UK, along with the Benelux and other northern countries, have traditionally been the most vocal proponents of free trade and regulatory restraint in the EU.Britain’s imminent departure may tip the balance of the EU towards the more protectionist, and often anti-US, sentiment of large members like France. Given the huge levels of US foreign direct investment into Ireland, Irish officials and representatives of like-minded countries have become the de facto defenders of US interests when it comes to matters of trade and commerce in Brussels.Ireland may welcome the current surge in interest in Washington in the Brexit debate. But with the imminent departure of the UK, the US may find it needs Ireland more than ever in the corridors of power in Europe.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Il Primo Re (The First King)Archaeologists in Rome are to embark on a quest for a 2,500-year-old stone sarcophagus linked to the legend of the city’s fabled founder – Romulus.They believe it lies hidden in a chamber deep beneath the Forum, once the heart of ancient Rome and now an area of ruined temples and imperial palaces that attracts millions of tourists a year.The stone casket is believed to date from the 4th century BC, when it was placed inside a chamber in a mystical, sacred area of the Forum that celebrated the founding of Rome.Archeologists believe it lies around 10ft underground, buried out of sight beneath a building known as the Comitium – a precursor to the Roman Senate.Romulus is said to have founded Rome in the 8th century BC after murdering his brother, Remus.According to legend, the twins were ordered to be thrown into the Tiber in a basket by a vengeful king.Instead, his servants left them on the riverbank, where they were found and suckled by a she-wolf, which remains the symbol of the city.Re-enactment enthusiasts take part in a parade in Rome that celebrates the supposed founding of the city on April 21, 753 BCArcheologists made a connection between the long-lost stone sarcophagus and Romulus after scouring classical texts, including accounts by Horace and Livy, as well as records left by a 19th century archeologist, Giacomo Boni.He glimpsed the stone casket during excavations in 1899 but did not make the link to Romulus.The chamber was sealed and forgotten – until now.“This is a new hypothesis, that the sarcophagus is linked to the cult of Romulus,” Patrizia Fortini, the archeologist in charge of the project, told The  as she surveyed the sight in the Forum, beneath a giant triumphal arch.“We don’t expect to find any bodily remains – the cask was placed there about four centuries after Romulus’ death as a symbol, a memory of the man,” she said.A still from The First King, a new Italian film about Romulus and RemusThere is no concrete proof that Romulus and Remus existed. According to legend, Romulus was murdered and dismembered by members of the Senate, before ascending to the heavens as a god.But Alfonsina Russo, the director of the archeological area that includes the Forum, the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum, believes that the legend of the feuding brothers was based on the real founders of Rome.“He may have existed. There are always elements of truth to foundation myths like this,” she said, standing on a cracked marble pavement beneath which the sarcophagus is thought to be hidden.The search for the casket, which is due to start in the summer, comes as a new film about Romulus is released in Italy.Il Primo Re, or The First King, is a blood-soaked epic in which the actors converse in archaic Latin – it comes with subtitles in Italian.A parade to celebrate the anniversary of the mythical founding of Rome by Romulus in 753 BC “The release of the film is a coincidence,” said Prof Russo. “We’ve been working on this project for years. The film portrays the early Romans as barbarians, almost like Stone Age people, but in fact they were very sophisticated with a highly developed social order.”If the casket is discovered, and if it does indeed have links to the legendary founder of Rome, the area will be opened to the public.In 2007, archeologists found a cave which was a shrine to the legend of Romulus and Remus being nursed by the she-wolf.The cave, known as the Lupercale, derived from the Latin word for wolf, was a place of worship that was sacred to the ancient Romans.Decorated with coloured mosaics and sea shells, it was found 50ft underground in a previously unexplored area of the Palatine Hill, where Roman emperors built their palaces.Please review our commenting policyLibby Squire latest updates: Everything we know so far about the missing Hull studentUS election 2020: The Democrat candidates who are running for presidentPriceless artworks by masters including Canaletto, Turner and Constable are to finally go on displayPolice investigating Libby Squire disappearance given more time to question suspectThird of antibiotics prescribed by doctors are \u0026#39unaccounted for\u0026#39, warns Chief Medical OfficerTheresa May to urge MPs to give her more time to seek Brexit concessionsComment: Bosses who gamble with workers\u0026#39 pensions will end up behind barsComment: Wreckers on both sides of the Channel must not stand in the way of a dealBosses who \u0026#39play fast and loose\u0026#39 with pensions face seven years in jailDuchess of Sussex visit leads to first international donations for sex workers charitySir Philip Green: Government accused of \u0026#39lacklustre\u0026#39 response to non-disclosure agreements controversyTory chairman criticises election watchdog\u0026#39s plan to expand powersSir Philip Green\u0026#39s Arcadia facing accusations of cover-up after key testimonies left out of harassment reportSir Philip Green: Baroness Brady refuses to resign as chairman of his business empire Calls grow for police to investigate allegations against Sir Philip GreenSir Philip Green accuser: \u0026#39It’s wrong that a piece of paper should stop a person telling how they were violated\u0026#39Comment: Iniduals who think they can bully and harass people, be warnedComment: You don\u0026#39t have to be Left-wing to run an Oxbridge college - but nowadays it certainly helpsComment: Utopia won\u0026#39t be built on universal basic incomeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/09/TELEMMGLPICT000174713250_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkJ14jsCM70EffKCLi-nOV8v3J5czXUwse5cOdAFj5RE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"duke edinburgh voluntarily surrenders driving licence buckingham","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh has voluntarily surrendered his licence following the crash last monthThe Duke of Edinburgh has given up driving as police passed their file on his crash near the Sandringham estate to prosecutors, it emerged on Saturday.Buckingham Palace announced that the 97-year-old duke voluntarily surrendered his driving licence after “careful consideration”.It comes almost a month after he was involved in a crash on a crossroads near the Queen\u0027s Norfolk estate in which his Land Rover was overturned.The collision left the female passenger of a Kia Carens with a broken wrist, while a woman driver and nine-month-old baby boy escaped unharmed from their smoke-filled car.Norfolk Police have been investigating the crash for three weeks, interviewing witnesses to decide whether it was in the public interest to bring about a prosecution. On Saturday the force said it had sent the file onto the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).The Duke at the scene of the crash on the Queen\u0026#39s Sandringham Estate last monthA spokesman for Norfolk Police said: “Norfolk Police can confirm that the 97 year old driver of the Land Rover involved in the collision at Sandringham on Thursday 17 January 2019 has today voluntarily surrendered his licence to officers.“We will follow the standard procedure and return the licence to the DVLA.“The investigation file for the collision has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration.”A CPS spokesperson added: We review each file carefully before a decision is  made and will take this development into account.The Duke has already appeared to accept responsibility for the accident, saying in a letter to having been dazzled by the sun.On Saturday, Buckingham Palace said: “After careful consideration The Duke of Edinburgh has taken the decision to voluntarily surrender his driving licence.”At the time of the crash, legal experts said that if he surrendered his licence, the Duke would not be required to appear in court. It is a marked change of heart from the Duke’s original reaction to the crash, which saw him take delivery of a replacement Land Rover the day after the crash and drive it out on the roads around Sandringham without a seatbelt.The accident, on January 17, saw the Duke pulled out of his car through the sunroof after it “tumbled” across the A149 and ended on its side.Emma Fairweather, who was injured in a car crash involving the Duke of Edinburgh The following day, he attended the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King\u0027s Lynn for closer examination, with palace aides saying he had “no injuries of concern despite reports of him bleeding.The Duke later wrote to the driver and passenger of the other car, telling Emma Fairweather, who broke her wrist: “I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley cross-roads.“I have been across that crossing any number of times and I know very well the amount of traffic that uses that main road.It was a bright sunny day and at about three in the afternoon, the sun was low over the Wash.“In other words, the sun was shining low over the main road.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If, for example, a user asks a digital assistant for information on purchasing a birthday gift, the digital assistant may use a happy emoji to present results.Apple already has a history of developing animated emojis, most recently with the launch of\u0026nbspan Animoji feature with iOS 12 called Memoji.Other features described in the patent include gesture controls and Face ID, meaning HomePod users could perform basic controls like scrolling through a menu simply by moving their hands.The FaceID feature would allow the smart speaker to recognise inidual users through facial recognition technology, allowing for greater personalised use of the HomePod.It is not clear if Apple intends to introduce these technologies with the next iteration of the HomePod – expected to be launched later this year – and company policy is to not comment on rumours or speculation surrounding forthcoming devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A rising hash rate will also raise concerns about bitcoin\u0027s environmental impact, with its electricity consumption estimated to be more than the country of Ireland.Other analysts had warned that a fall below $3,000 would have signalled a blood bath for bitcoin, as traders sought to offload the crashing cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Except it didn’t. We were delayed 28 hours.At first, as we waited in the lounge, no explanation was given. Then it was announced a faulty part had been discovered on a wing flap.

He treated the passengers like human beings, like grown-ups, describing how the wing flap was not operating properly when they tested it, and on inspection, a tiny bracket was found to have snapped. BA didn’t have one, but he was optimistic that Emirates did. It could be fitted fairly quickly, and we would soon be able to fly to London safely.After an hour it emerged Emirates did not have the part, after all.\u0026nbspKLM might, we were told. Before long, the captain was back to\u0026nbsptell us we would not be flying that night.\u0026nbspWe would have to wait 24 hours, for the bracket to be flown in from London, while BA would put\u0026nbspus up in hotels.British Airways celebrates 100 years with a retro paint jobSpanish Airways? BA seeks support from Spain amid Brexit anxietyAirlines that are on the EU’s banned listHe was calm, open and authoritative. As we clustered round he dealt clearly with all our queries. Nobody had any complaints. Thanks to the captain’s communication skills, the mood was one of good-humoured acceptance. He said he would see us the following evening, bade us farewell, apologised again, but stressed that our safety was paramount, and returned to his aircraft. Not one person had a bad word to say about him, or BA.If anything, as a result of his performance, BA’s stock actually soared. We understood that these things happen, it was just our bad luck the break occurred on our trip\u0026nbspbut, thank God\u0026nbspand thanks to BA’s\u0026nbspdiligence, it was spotted in time.Alas, the company’s standing was to sharply plummet. There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For good reason: the life of Elizabeth Morgan, née Caswell, is like a plotline on Call the Midwife. Morgan was born in Castleside, County Durham, as an unexpected twin to a family so poor\u0026nbspshe had to sleep in a drawer.Aged\u0026nbsp16\u0026nbspshe qualified as a nurse and worked in the Edinburgh slums. After responding to an advert from the Department for International\u0026nbspDevelopment in the 1970s, she was posted to Borneo\u0026nbspwhere she delivered babies in the rainforest and set up medical centres in remote tribal villages. By the time she came home, she had been involved in delivering the last ever smallpox vaccine.Michelle Obama’s memoir promotion will look like ‘a Madonna tour’This simple summerhouse near Berlin hides the most incredible storyPrince’s memoir will finally be released later this yearFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMorgan had been to classes to learn how to write a memoir. She tried to write down the things she had experienced, but they always looked like lists of dates. Then last year, when she learned she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, her daughter knew it was their last chance. Ms Stewart says: “We thought if we didn’t get it written down we never would.”In February, Ms Stewart and her mother received four bound copies of their mother’s hardback memoir: Elizabeth Caswell: Ai ya, Sister!\u0026nbspElizabeth appeared in a black and white portrait on the cover: a striking\u0026nbspdark-haired woman with clear eyes and a prim white nurses hat. The memoir is one of hundreds that have been produced by Story Terrace, a startup founded on the idea\u0026nbspthere should be a biographer for every person. Using ghostwriters, it plans to turn a million life stories into books within 10 years.\u0026nbsp“It’s like social media for writing books, you find the person who fits with you,” Ms Stewart says. \u0026nbspShe had looked at hiring a biographer before, but had always been put off by the cost, which ran into the thousands. On the Story Terrace website, she\u0026nbspwas able to browse writers, read sample chapters and select a package starting at £1,500 for four\u0026nbsphours of interviews and four copies of a 60-page colour hardback book.\u0026nbspRutger Bruining, who started Story Terrace in the Netherlands in 2014, got the idea for a bespoke writing service after he saw\u0026nbspAustralian company Freelancer,\u0026nbspa platform described as “the world’s largest marketplace for outsourcing” where people can compete for jobs,\u0026nbspgo public. In 2013\u0026nbspthe company was forced to close its initial public offering (IPO) early after demand overwhelmed supply of the 30 million shares offered.\u0026nbspThe IPO caught Bruining’s attention. He had been thinking about scalable ways to tell people’s stories. After a stint in management consultancy, he did an MBA at Columbia University in New York and then returned to Europe to work in private equity in London. He saw the Freelancer IPO and was struck by two things: the site hosted really good writers who were offering their services to anyone, and the founders were using software to manage freelancers all around the world.\u0026nbspThis technology opened up the possibilities for a memoir-writing agency. Rather than hire 20 staff writers to work with customers, Story Terrace works with 500 writers and matches them to clients based on their location, education and cost, among other factors. “We can do that anywhere in the world, and we can still make beautiful books for people,” Mr Bruining says. “Without tech that wouldn’t be possible.”Story Terrace recommended a writer called Judy Brown to tell Elizabeth Morgan’s story. The family were allocated several hours, but Ms Stewart says they spent a productive afternoon. Ms Brown came to see her mother despite a broken ankle and asked gentle questions that started to reveal a narrative. Ms Brown says that process of getting to know a client well enough to inhabit their voice “can take a few gos”, but describes the process as an honour. “It makes people feel like they have done something. Until you look back and you see the story as a whole it can be hard to see quite how much you’ve achieved.”Neither Mr Bruining nor Ms Brown reveal writers’\u0026nbsprates. The former\u0026nbspsays the writers, who get paid a set fee per job, are “by far the biggest cost” to the business. Ms Brown, who is retired and has worked on as many as 14 memoirs through Story Terrace, says\u0026nbspthe work provides useful extra income, but that it would be difficult to make a full-time living out of it.Story Terrace launched in the UK in 2016 and has now had 700 clients globally. The company raised £590,000 in a crowdfunding round with Seedrs in 2017, taking the total value raised to £1.5m. Mr Bruining says the money is going towards building a “bookmaker platform” that will automate the design processes so they no longer have to employ inhouse designers.The next task will be to scale. In January\u0026nbspthe company recruited Francois Coumau, a former eBay executive, to make new hires and smooth processes as the company grows. Angela Watts has joined after spending eight years at Spotify in the lead up to its IPO, to work on building awareness of the brand. Ms Watts says\u0026nbspshe was impressed by the early success of the service: “Story Terrace’s growth to date is admirable for a company creating a completely new product category – and they’ve only just scratched the surface.”\u0026nbspHalf the books commissioned on Story Terrace are gifts, often from relatives. Many have revealed extraordinary stories. A woman called Teresa Ibrahim has narrated her story growing up in poverty in rural Sudan, “in the fog of civil war”, to setting up charities for the education and empowerment of other displaced women.

And, that lack of investment means Amazon could still change course if it felt like local conditions were not as ideal as previously thought.The situation in Queens stands in contrast with how the company has proceeded in Virginia, where local leaders moved quickly to approve an incentive package to keep Amazon\u0027s interest in the region. New York politicians are still mulling over their own package, which is not expected to receive approval until 2020.Should Amazon choose to scrap its plans for New York City, the company would still theoretically have plenty of options after having received numerous proposals from all over North America during a lengthy bidding process.Among the politicians in New York State who have spoken out against the deal are Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district borders the areas chosen by Amazon for development. In the aftermath of the public announcement, opponents have gone door to door in the Queens neighbourhood to warn residents of coming rent hikes if the tech giant moves in.It is not clear what Amazon would do in the case that New York ultimately abandons its plan to offer an incentive package, and some analysts have noted that the company could still develop in the city on a smaller scale. Other tech giants, like Google, have notable already opened up facilities in the city with that strategy.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We understood that these things happen, it was just our bad luck the break occurred on our trip\u0026nbspbut, thank God\u0026nbspand thanks to BA’s\u0026nbspdiligence, it was spotted in time.Alas, the company’s standing was to sharply plummet. There was no one to guide us out of the airport, the hotel we were due to go to kept changing, there wasn’t a bus to take us there. We felt abandoned, at 5.30am at Dubai airport, a huge, sprawling place, buzzing with people even at that hour in the morning. After waiting forlornly for a coach, some of us took a cab and headed to one of the hotels that had been mentioned back in the lounge.When we got there, the hotel reception was unprepared for our arrival. Another wait ensued, while they tried to contact a local travel agent who was liaising with BA. Finally, at 7.30am, we went to our rooms.At night, we again went off to the airport. Again, there was no bus, no one co-ordinating our departure from the hotel, nobody taking care of us. Again, we had to jump into taxis.Once more at the airport, there now was pandemonium. We had to check in, at the same time as the passengers booked on that night’s BA106. Two sets of customers all trying to check-in simultaneously on flights bearing the same number. Eventually, after much shouting, those due to go as scheduled that evening were allowed to go first –\u0026nbspwe were informed our plane would be taking off an hour after theirs, at 3.30am.Forget the outrage about Dyson’s HQ move - we need to learn from itCheck-in staff were swamped, not least because many were also\u0026nbspchecking in for connecting flights at Heathrow. We reached the lounge, and waited,\u0026nbspand waited.We saw the other passengers leave for their flight which took off as planned. Ours, due to depart in an hour, was still not being shown as ready to board. A\u0026nbsptannoy\u0026nbspannouncement said it was being pushed back further. No reason was offered – that was it. Now there was anger, and mutterings of “next time I will fly Emirates”. Finally\u0026nbspwe left Dubai, 28 hours late.The contrast between the earlier delay and this one, between the captain and the ground staff, between the orderly manner in which he told us we would be staying in Dubai for 24 hours and the chaos subsequent to his news could not have been starker.Why? A captain feels responsible for his aircraft, its crew and passengers. Ours was driven by a sense of duty to see that we were okay, that we understood and appreciated the situation. The ground staff, and whoever was meant to take care of our well-being after we left his charge did not share his feeling of responsibility. They were local, they were dealing with numerous flights all day long, not just one that was late.The captain was driven by ownership they were not. The captain had been well-taught\u0026nbspbut he also came across entirely spontaneously. His colleagues had either missed the lesson or had not taken it in. Rather than behave naturally they stuck to an all-too familiar, inflexible, robotic style of delivery. No one was in command, nobody cared about the customers.Sadly, all the captain’s efforts were undone. BA must try harder: it’s no use one person stepping up, if the others around him fail to do so. It’s about everybody working together, and them all being joined up, not an inidual operating solo. He may have been brilliant, but the brand still emerged as the overall loser.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Until the other day, I had no idea that a sausage even had any meaning (unless, that is, you happen to be ravenously hungry). Imagine the surprise, therefore, of the conservators in London who, back in 1983, were sprucing up a classic painting by the 17th-century Dutch master Jan Steen, when they discovered a lost sausage. Or rather not so much lost as “disappeared”.\u0026nbspYou can see that painting, Celebrating the Birth, in all its domestic glory, in the wonderful Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, just off Oxford Street. But prior to 1983 you would not have seen the sausage, or indeed the hand of the long-haired artist himself, about to go out of the door at the back of the kitchen, holding two fingers over the head of the babe. Painting “cleaners” (or conservators) are sometimes like detectives carefully inspecting the scene of a crime. In this case their research took them back to the Victorian period when the works of Shakespeare could be re-written for the purpose of making more of a happy ending – and when the statue of a naked David in the V\u0026ampA could have a fig-leaf applied to the relevant parts on the occasion of a visit from Queen Victoria.Probably sometime in the 1850s, a skilful painter had been employed to paint over (rather as you might use software today to remove undesirable elements from your favourite holiday snap) the offending sausage and the two-fingered salute – originally dating from 1664 (the year is\u0026nbspspelt out in the painting itself). But what was the big deal about the sausage anyway? How could hypersensitive Victorian morality be offended by the depiction thereof?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI had the advantage of being accompanied by the very knowledgeable Anne Fay, head of education at the Wallace Collection, but you can work it all out for yourself just by looking very intently at the restored painting, now hanging in East Gallery II. In Holland you can still talk about a “Jan Steen” household or room. But the phrase isn’t necessarily complimentary. It doesn’t mean “beautiful” or “artistic”, but rather “chaotic” or “messy”. “Celebrating the birth” depicts a busy, bustling kitchen scene or “lying-in room”.There are 16 people crowded into the room (counting the babe), with a lot of cooking going on around the fireplace. In the foreground, lying on the floor are several broken eggshells together with pots of what looks like maple syrup and a roll on a plate. A buxom cook is leaning over a cooking pot mixing some kind of brew with a ladle and holding out her other hand for payment.The sausage (or, technically, a string of sausages) is hanging down from above the fireplace, attached to the chimney. It is long and rather limp-looking and probably deserves the word, “dangling”. A maid is handling it, looking out of the picture directly towards the spectator, with an expression that might be roguish. But what does it mean and why would you want to paint it over? People ate sausages back then, didn’t they? Why would you not have one in a kitchen?The sausage, you will have guessed, is susceptible to a phallic reading. The prudish Victorians\u0026nbspthought so. It could be mistaken for the same sexual organ\u0026nbspthe David fig-leaf was designed to conceal. And a long but rather flaccid one at that. But, as Freud may have said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. And isn’t a sausage sometimes nothing more than a traditional form of fast food? But now combine the sausage with the image of the painter holding up two fingers over the head of the father figure.Is this an obscene gesture? Only in the sense that the two fingers are meant to represent horns and thus signify “cuckold”. The painter, in other words, is suggesting – every father’s nightmare – that the father is not in fact the father. His wife is cheating on him. So we look carefully at the nominal father, who is holding the child in one arm and reaching into his pouch with his other hand (probably to pay the midwife). He has a grey beard and an apron, and is no spring chicken. Combined with the limp sausage, the implication is that the ageing man could be impotent and incapable of fathering a child.Who then is the father? And we should remember that there is a pregnant woman in the kitchen, sitting comfortably on the left of the scene, sipping a drink, looking rather beatific (possibly sozzled too). The leading candidate for rogue inseminator is the painter himself. Rather like Alfred Hitchcock making a brief appearance in one of his own movies, Jan Steen would often paint himself into the picture. And if he is making a point here, it is less an assertion of his own sexual prowess than the subtle reminder that indeed he and no other has given birth to every single one of the figures depicted in the painting. The two fingers are like a Steen signature, saying: “I am the artist.”The Wallace Collection is one of the nation’s great treasures but modest in scope by comparison with some of our better-known museums. And it’s housed in a building, Hertford House, that doesn’t look much like a museum either. It was originally a hunting lodge when it was built in the 18th century, with a curving driveway in front. You might not even notice it, tucked away as it is behind Selfridge’s. But the whole collection is an exercise is being more alert and noticing stuff you might not otherwise notice or know about. For example, until I had a good look at a gorgeous ancien régime chest of drawers that once adorned Versailles, I had no idea that the chest of drawers (or “commode”) was an 18th-century invention. I have no idea where they used to put their socks and smalls before then.\u0026nbspMy guide Anne Fay helpfully explained that the word “Rococo” comes from the French rocaille, meaning rocky ground or rockery, and containing elaborate references to natural configurations such as shells and pebbles. But she also directed me towards a small but bewitching painting, The Swing\u0026nbspby the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard (dated 1767). The central figure in this work is a pure Disney princess at first glance. The girl on the swing – or let’s say, young woman, aged perhaps 18 at most – is radiant. She seems to generate light or, to turn it around, the spotlight is all on her. She looks ecstatic and her peachy, lacey, frilly dress similarly emanates a kind of joie de vivre. Even her bergère hat is jaunty.But again, if you look carefully, there are elements in this painting that Disney, while borrowing the wardrobe, would surely prohibit. One of the girl’s dainty shoes is flying up through the air. Lying on the ground, to the left of the painting, underneath the swing, is a young man, his hat in his hand, a flower in his buttonhole, his face illuminated by the light of the girl. He too looks delighted. His gaze is directed towards the girl. But if we follow his gaze carefully we can see that he is looking right up into her dress, which is billowing open as she kicks her legs. We see a flash of bare thigh, she may or may not be wearing any underwear, we do not know. But there is a liberated, playful quality to the girl that suggests possibly not. Without any actual cameras, the painting gives us a classic scene of upskirting. But, so far as we can judge, consensual. The girl and the young man may well be lovers.\u0026nbspBut as you might expect there is a love triangle here. Look to the right of the painting and you will see, almost hidden in the shadows, a much older man, who is pulling the ropes attached to the swing – perhaps trying to pull the girl back to him. Who is he? Probably the husband. Also, quite possibly – as in the Steen painting – cuckolded, displaced in the marital bed by the younger man (who is, after all, already lying down and is being given a privileged through-the-keyhole glimpse of what is typically concealed).The girl on the swing looks entirely carefree. She is having a great time. She may be making some mocking gesture to do with her husband. But there are subtle hints in the painting that not all is well. For one thing, if you look carefully, the ropes that suspend the swing from some kind of grotto appear to be fraying. The swing itself may be unsafe. There are storm clouds gathering. The cupid figures dotted around the canvas are looking nervous. And finally, a little white-haired dog that you might not even notice, down on the right-hand side, is watching and barking. As if everything is about to go wrong. The painting is only a still, a snapshot, but it contains narratives, with alternative endingsBut probably the single most famous painting in the whole of the collection is The Laughing Cavalier, by Franz Hals (1624). Of course the irony of this painting is that the subject is neither laughing nor is he a cavalier. But he does look almost absurdly pleased with himself. He is smiling broadly and even his bristling handlebar moustache is smiling. He has rosy cheeks, curly hair, bright eyes, and is in blooming health. There are unproven theories as to who he is or was precisely. But none of that really matters. The laughing cavalier is a hyper-realistic image of vivacity, brimming over with good will and pleasure and, perhaps, anticipation.Because, as in the Fragonard, there is a suggestion of a sexual encounter to come. Is he perhaps a bridegroom looking forward to his wedding night? Or is he on his way to meet his secret lover? His richly detailed garb implies as much. The embroidered sleeve of his silk tunic (with no less than nine buttons on the cuff) is decorated with any number of symbols suggestive of a carnal union: Cupid’s arrows and lovers’ knots. But we also have a flaming cornucopia and a bee – connoting honey and sweetness but also, potentially, a sting.So Hals is being rather poised and ambiguous here. The laughing cavalier is rather like the girl on the swing, on a high, but he could conceivably come down with a bump if he’s not careful. We don’t know, we only have the immortal moment of hope and expectation. Which cannot be extinguished. But could be understood as over-optimistic. And yes, the eyes really do follow you around the room.I live a 10-minute cycle ride away from the Wallace Collection. And yet I barely knew it was there until the other day. The Wallace Collection is due mainly to Sir Richard Wallace, who was probably the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess of Hertford and is described in a new book by Suzanne Higgott as “the most fortunate man of his day”. His collection was bequeathed to the nation by his widow, Lady Wallace, in 1897. But she didn’t leave any endowment for the purposes of upkeep.The museum, which is free to enter, now makes its living partly on the basis of retail and renting out its space. You can have a wedding party, Jan Steen-style, in the Grand Gallery for a cool £20,000. Or stage your corporate event there, in one of the most elegant settings in the country. Or just come for lunch or dinner in the courtyard café.A museum devoted to dogs is opening in New YorkInside New York’s new spy museumSalvador Dali artwork damaged \u0027by visitors taking photos\u0027 in galleryBut the paintings and fine works that are exhibited there remind you of the importance of not just seeing but looking. As one of the parables (in Mark’s gospel) says, you can see and yet not perceive. One of the great lookers (in the sense of doing the looking rather than being looked at) was Henry Moore. An exhibition of his works is opening at the Wallace in March. Moore would sit here and get inspiration in the armoury. He could see helmets were not just function they were also form. The helmet morphs, in his hands, into a symbol of protection that embraces mother and child.\u0026nbspBut what is the point of art anyway? Is it to reveal, in a Freudian way, the hidden pathways of the unconscious? To boast of the artist’s libido? One plausible evolutionary theory about the function of art maintains that it came about as an accessory to courting. A way of wooing or seducing. Come up and see my cave paintings some time. So therefore it’s not surprising if love triangles and other erotic geometries also get into the picture. But it can’t just be that surely.\u0026nbspFor anyone brought up on Monet and Picasso, the Wallace Collection, with works that date largely from before the French Revolution, comes as a bit of a shock. The level of sheer realism, in some of those Dutch paintings, is dazzling. But there is a connection with modern painters even as abstract as, say, Mark Rothko (whose work is dramatised in the play Red). All those sustained blocks of colour, or Campbell’s soup cans (as painted by Warhol), are related to The Swing and The Laughing Cavalier by virtue of the infra-ordinary – all the stuff that we normally don’t notice. Works of art ask us to be more alert. To be better sensory beings. They are telling us to pay attention to the world. To take note of little things. Even if it’s only a sausage.Andy Martin is the author of Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbspThe exhibition, “Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads”, runs at the Wallace Collection 6 March to 23 June.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

But the mission was retired in October, when its fuel finally run out and Nasa moved the telescope into a safe orbit and shut it down.The image – called last light, just as the first light was taken nearly ten years earlier – closes a mission that has discovered thousands of those distant worlds and brought hope that habitable planets deep in our galaxy could be waiting to be found.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince Kepler first opened its eye up to space and started looking for those stars, it found more than 2,600 worlds beyond our solar system – proving that planets are far more common than expected and that other places like our own Earth could be lurking out there.The image also shows some of the effect of those ten years. The blackened gaps at the middle and top of the image are where parts have failed in the camera, but Kepler was designed in a modular way that meant those problems did not affect the rest of the instrument.The final image came after Kepler\u0027s last observation campaign, for which it was pointed towards the constellation Aquarius.

That slight overlap means astronomers can compare data from the two spacecraft, helping calibrate and improve the data Nasa will go on to receive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel.

Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson.

Firstly, patronising language and awful single-shaming more redolent of early 2000s Bridget Jones, not a modern and empowered fintech brand,” Ms Bain tweeted.“Secondly, the way it pries into people’s private spending and exploits it so strangers can laugh at perfectly valid life choices that – we’re all expected to agree – are sad and pathetic.

The group reported a loss of 270bn rupees (£2.9bn) for the third quarter of this financial year, the biggest loss recorded in Indian corporate history. Shares in Tata plunged by as much as 30 per cent – the biggest drop in 26 years \u0026nbspafter the company revealed the figures. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe problems largely stem from the Jaguar unit, which makes up the bulk of Tata’s revenue. The group said the automotive industry is “facing significant market, technological, and regulatory headwinds”, and added that investment in new models and technology remains high. Given the “muted-demand scenario”, the company warned that JLR is set to swing to a loss this year due to weak sales, contrasting sharply with expectations that the British carmaker would break even.Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspannounced 4,500 job cuts earlier this year, the majority of which will affect UK workers. The firm has also warned that it needs more certainty around Brexit in order to continue investing in its UK operations, and said a “bad Brexit” would cost the company more than £1.2bn in profit each year.Tata chairman Natarajan\u0026nbspChandrasekaran said: “In JLR, the market conditions continue to be challenging particularly in China.

In a case such as this where the applicant is not a burden on the state, families should be able to stay together.“If immigration rules continue to be implemented in such a restrictive and indiscriminate way, then we will continue to see cases where elderly relatives are separated from their loved ones.”Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said:\u0026nbsp“No family should be forced apart. Yet a grandmother is being forced out of her home and sent halfway around the world from her family simply because her husband has retired.“We are told that we have to blame people born elsewhere for everything that’s wrong in our society, but can anybody tell me whose life gets better when we do this to people?”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We don’t routinely comment on inidual cases nor would it be appropriate to comment while there are ongoing legal proceedings.”Asylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Campus makes me feel uneasy and anxious as a result of the climate created by the chat.”Launching an independent review into Warwick’s disciplinary procedures in the wake of the scandal, Mr Croft said: “We are deeply sorry and understand the distress this has caused the victims of this abuse and the wider impact which we know has been felt by our students and our staff.”Ms Doyland added: “This is clearly a symbol of a wider problem – it’s not just happening in group chats or at some universities, this is happening in everyday encounters and it is ingrained within society. It is the responsibility in particular of universities to lead.”A spokesperson for The University of Sheffield said: “As soon as our Medical School was made aware of this issue it followed established investigatory procedures, in line with University disciplinary and Fitness to Practise regulations.“Fitness to Practise procedures use standards set by national regulatory bodies, including the General Medical Council, to review conduct that could impact a student’s suitability to practise medicine.”the university of warwickOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom. This devilish euro maniac is doing his best to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control.”Asked about the row, Ms May’s official spokesman said: “It’s a question for Donald Tusk whether he thinks using that language was appropriate.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But she was sent back empty-handed.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0026nbspmet the heads of all the EU institutions and was told the same thing: we won’t renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHowever, they said they would be happy to change the political declaration for the future relationship.What’s the difference?The withdrawal agreement is a binding legal contract – it covers issues like what happens to EU citizens in the UK, the orce bill, and, most controversially, the Irish backstop policy.But there is another part of the agreement between the UK and EU. Its full name is “the political declaration on the future relationship”. It isn’t legally binding, but it spells out what sort of relationship the EU and the UK government intend to have after Brexit – whether or not the UK is in the single market, customs union, etc.What’s currently in the political declaration?In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handIt’s very vague. You may remember “Chequers” – that was Theresa May’s plan that she agreed with her cabinet, after negotiating with her own party. That’s not happening – the EU has rejected it.\u0026nbspThe declaration is currently more-or-less meaningless, spelling out both the EU and the UK’s red lines. It leaves actual decisions on the future relationship for the future. But unless the UK’s red lines shift, it essentially points to a hard Brexit – border checks on goods, no free movement, and the like.Why would the EU suggest changing the political declaration if the backstop is the problem, and it is in the withdrawal agreement?There are two reasons. The first is technical: the future relationship, as it currently stands, would not prevent a hard border in Ireland. The EU sees the backstop as an insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland – no matter what future relationship is negotiated, there won’t be one as long as the backstop can come in.But a more ambitious future relationship that kept the UK aligned with the single market and customs union would prevent a hard border by itself – and mean the backstop never needs to happen. In that way, it is related to the backstop.\u0026nbspThe second reason is political: changing the declaration is key for those who support a soft Brexit. Labour says it will support the deal in parliament if the future relationship is changed to include alignment with the single market and a customs union, as well as protections for workers’ rights.\u0026nbspSo why doesn’t Theresa May renegotiate the future relationship to pass the deal?Jacob Rees-Mogg invited to strip naked for Brexit debateJaguar owner posts thumping loss in another blow to UK car industry May facing resignations as Brussels sends her away empty-handedSoftening the Brexit laid out in the future relationship would have the opposite effect on the Tories as it would to Labour: most of Theresa May’s own MPs would become even more hostile to it, and her.She might be able to pass the Brexit deal with Labour support – if she made it that far. But her party would be in uproar. They don’t like the backstop – or even Chequers – because they see it as too similar to being in the EU. Labour’s plan for a permanent customs union and single market alignment would likely alienate even more, because it represents even closer alignment to Brussels.There are some Tory MPs who would welcome a softer Brexit, but they are thought to be in the minority.\u0026nbspSo would Theresa May be ousted if she backed Labour’s demands?It’s not easy\u0026nbspto predict what would happen. In one sense, she is safe: she cannot be formally ousted as leader of the Tory party for another 10 months. This is because under the party’s rules, a leader cannot be challenged for a year after they survive a first attempt at being toppled from within,\u0026nbspas she did late last year.However, she is not immune from the entirely separate parliamentary confidence votes that take place in the Commons. These are the standard votes of all MPs on whether they have confidence in the government. She would remain leader of the Conservative Party if she lost – but no longer be prime ministerCreated with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendWhether livid Tory MPs – or the DUP on whom she relies for support – will continue to support her in these votes is an open question. There is no limit to how many can be called or when.Alternatively, even if she cannot be formally ousted, the party might simply become ungovernable. May might struggle to fill her front benches and be in a state of open warfare with the rest of her party. That situation has effectively forced other party leaders to resign, even when they cannot be technically made to leave.Or it could all be fine. We can’t predict the future – but she certainly has good cause to be worried.People say the political declaration is not legally binding – is that true?Yes, it’s simply a statement of intent by the two parties. But political declarations are still important – you can’t be taken to court over them, but if the political pressure is still there to enforce them, they have an effect.\u0026nbspFor example, the part of the Good Friday Agreement that says there should be no hard border is a political declaration. The situation the UK is currently in shows that has real force – as long as there is political will to enforce it.It is likely that Labour would hold the government to its political declaration of the future relationship with the EU – if the declaration was discarded later, the government would have no majority for the Brexit it sought. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Countries are being asked to sign up blind,” said Liz May, the charity’s head of policy.Labour want new Brexit vote if May rejects our plan, McDonnell says“Without the full picture of how the EU and UK will trade in the future, it is impossible for countries to judge what these deals are really worth, how they will work in practice or even how some elements will be enforced.“Instead of acknowledging this difficulty, the government is relying on developing countries being compelled to sign up at the last minute, rather than risk high tariffs being slapped on their key exports.“This type of bad-faith negotiating – using implicit threats to get countries ‘over the line’ – is not a great way to start the UK’s independent trade policy.”No developing country has gone public with criticism of the UK’s approach, but some are believed to have objected privately and displayed their unhappiness by refusing to re-sign the deals so far.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handMay facing resignations as Brussels sends her away empty-handedJacob Rees-Mogg invited to strip naked for Brexit debateNo-deal fears over medicine supplies spark rush for UK-supplied drugsCrucially, food products, particularly bananas, sugar and beef, have among the highest tariffs if a country must trade on WTO rules, without a preferential deal.Mr Fox himself acknowledged the risk to developing countries from Brexit after his own department floated a proposal to abolish all tariffs if the UK crashes out of the EU, to avoid soaring inflation.He told a committee of MPs it would “erode preferences for developing countries, because they would lose the ability to take the advantage that is conferred by lower tariffs”.The “threats” are the latest controversy to erupt over the failure to secure the deals – worth 12 per cent of the UK’s total trade – with the clock ticking down to Brexit day.The focus has been on the danger of higher prices for British shoppers, and job losses in this country, but Traidcraft said the implications were potentially more severe for developing nations with deals.Richer countries, including Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Japan and South Korea, have the power to withstand pressure – and even push for better terms than exist\u0026nbspwith the EU.But, says Traidcraft, the poorest countries are vulnerable to the “sign up or lose\u0026nbspit” approach from London.A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade, said: “We take seriously our commitment to reduce poverty through trade and our top priority is providing continuity for our existing trading arrangements as we leave the European Union. \u0026nbsp“All developing countries that have economic partnership agreements with the UK have said they want to maintain their existing arrangements after we leave the EU and we have already signed a continuity agreement with eastern and southern African countries. We also intend to introduce a trade preference scheme that will benefit around 70 developing countries.”Ms May called for the UK to remove the pressure by offering one-way full-market access\u0026nbspon a temporary basis\u0026nbspuntil deals to help development could be agreed “in an orderly manner”.The UK was also unable to say which organisations would regulate health and safety of products\u0026nbspand standards\u0026nbsp“because some of this thinking simply hasn’t been done yet”, she added.If the Commons eventually passes the Brexit deal, it includes a 21-month transition period during which existing terms would continue to apply – but a crash-out would tear up the deals on 29 March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDepartment for International TradeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year and the event is claimed to be more important in the pagan calendar than the summer solstice, because it marks the \u0027re-birth\u0027 of the sun for the new yearMr Lavery also condemned the use of NDAs to suppress allegations of criminal behaviour and pledged his party would review the system if elected.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told The Independent: “I would have thought that by now Philip Green would understand the wisdom of the old saying that if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.“It is appalling that he is still threatening legal action and still hiding behind gagging orders. The government needs to make good on its promise to scrap the abuse of NDAs.“The honour committee should also take urgent action to restore the integrity of the honours system of which Philip Green’s knighthood currently makes a mockery.”The decision to remove a knighthood would be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee, a Whitehall panel which has stripped honours from former RBC boss Fred Goodwin and\u0026nbspRolf Harris.Maria Miller, Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, urged the government to take action on the use of gagging clauses to cover allegations of criminal behaviour.“We were told that the misuse of NDAs in the Harvey Weinstein case was\u0026nbspunusual and an extreme example.“Well, revelations this week and the evidence we have received into our current inquiry on NDAs suggest this is anything other than unique, and very much par for the course.”Sir Philip obtained the injunction last year after the newspaper contacted him to say it intended\u0026nbspto publish allegations of misconduct made against him by five employees, who had received substantial sums of money to keep their complaints confidential.It emerged last week that he had decided to drop the case\u0026nbspbecause it was “pointless” after Labour peer Lord Hain used parliamentary privilege to name him as the businessman behind the\u0026nbspinjunction.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Sir Antony Gormley sculpture was installed in 1998, with celebrations marking its 20th birthday this yearTeam Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury. The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year and the event is claimed to be more important in the pagan calendar than the summer solstice, because it marks the \u0027re-birth\u0027 of the sun for the new yearThe Tory MP said isions stop people making the most of the opportunities available.The plan sets out a series of steps the government will take in England – supported by £50m\u0026nbspin funding – to create “stronger, more confident and integrated communities”.The integrated communities action plan says immigrants should build a good understanding of British life and learn English – but local communities also have a responsibility to welcome newcomers.It promises a “package of practical information” for migrants “to help them meet, mix and build social connections with neighbours and the wider community”.Mr Brokenshire said: “We are a successful, erse democracy – open, tolerant and welcoming. These characteristics are as British as queuing and talking about the weather.“However, we cannot ignore the fact that too many places across the country have ides.\u0026nbspThe benefits and opportunities our great country offers are not always felt by everyone equally.”He said the action plan charts a course for how they will engage and work with communities to bring people together in acknowledgement “there is more that binds than ides us”.“And as we embark on a new future outside the European Union, we need to ensure that everyone, whatever their background, has access to the same opportunities,” he added.‘Crazy’ English invented champagne by mistake, claims wine expertThe plan also includes measures aimed at ensuring communities have access to information and support to improve their areas, including taking much-loved local assets into community ownership.Last autumn, the home secretary announced immigrants will have to pass a new “British values test” to become UK citizens and speak English to a higher standard.\u0026nbspSajid Javid criticised the current test – which quizzes immigrants on history, traditions and everyday life – as being too similar to “a pub quiz”.Speaking to the Tory conference, Mr Javid insisted British people “welcome newcomers”, but added: “The existing Life in the UK test for new citizens is not enough. “Maybe it is helpful for people to know the name of the sixth wife of Henry VIII but, far more important to me, is that they also understand the liberal, democratic values that bind our society together. Citizenship should mean more than being able to win a pub quiz. We need to make it a British values test – and that’s exactly what I will bring in.”He signalled the English language requirements for all new citizens would be strengthened. Mr Javid also used the speech to announce he would strip dual nationals of their UK citizenship if they were involved in gangs that sexually exploit children.Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, poured scorn on the idea of a British values test at the time, saying: “It’s not clear this is any improvement on Theresa May’s derided ‘British values’ test in 2015, or even Norman Tebbit’s earlier cricket test.“The idea that a government whose hostile environment policy and handling of the Windrush scandal has brought shame to the country, should be defining British values is deeply worrying.”Additional reporting by Press Association\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a green light for others. Yet these entitled hand-wringers still have the gall to whine about being inconvenienced.Tough.

Quick, the ambassador has had a seizure!Had Herr President Tusk, at this most delicate of moments, really told the likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to go to hell  Yes, pretty much.I know we are supposed to take ­mortal offence. I know we are meant to fan our faces and ask Nurse to bring us something to soothe our nerves after that nasty man uttered such a frightful insult.But I couldn’t help laughing at toothless Tusk’s tirade.At last, a European Union bigshot has blurted out his contempt for British voters.That’s surely preferable to all those smarmy smiles and fake phrases about “respect for each other’s values” and how we hope to work with “our European friends and partners”. Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk. The first is that in his youth he was a bit of a brawler.The ­second is that five years ago he resigned as Polish prime minister to take up his current cushy number in ­Brussels.Born in , Tusk grew up in the city of Gdansk, when Poland was a grimy ­colony of the USSR. His family had ­German roots and his dad, a carpenter, died when Donald was . It can’t have made for an easy youth.Gdansk gave rise to the Solidarity trade union ­movement which protested against Iron Curtain suppression.Tusk has recalled that in his youth he was “a typical hooligan” who would ­saunter along the streets in a gang, ­“cruising for a bruising”.In some ways, who can blame him  They were edgy days and young men will do what young men have done since time immemorial: Defend themselvesunder attack. Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand. Both of them, you may notice, are ­German. This sht in powers has ­happened slowly over decades and ­electorates have taken a while to notice.But now the voters are copping on and are at last making their ­displeasure plain.The British Leave vote was the firstgreat expression of that anger.All of which helps to explain why ­unelected EU officials have been so ­spittingly angry with the British public for voting Leave. We have busted the dam.That is why Tusk snarled at us on Wednesday. He and his sort feel badly threatened by Brexit.They feel understandably insecure about the future of the federal EU project.The Tusks of this world regard the ­peoples of Europe as an inconvenience.They were appalled with David Cameron for letting the referendum happen and they are now appalled with our MPs for not stopping Brexit.Shortly before his “hell” remark on Wednesday, Tusk expressed his disbelief that Theresa May was insisting on ­pressing ahead with Brexit, and his ­disappointment that Remainers at ­Westminster had not succeeded in blocking our departure from the EU.At that point I must confess I shouted something rude at the television in my office. “It’s because we had a f***ing ­referendum and we voted to leave!” I cried.Shouting at a TV set: Uh-oh, I may have been driven as mad by Brexit as dotty Tory Europhile Anna Soubry. Tusk’s ­outburst was similar. Everyone’s losing it!The teenage Donald Tusk — the one who used to tour the streets of Gdansk with his gang — would, I think, have ­understood. I am not recommending ­violence but politically this is certainly a time we could all do with clenching our knuckles and looking out for our interests.Cruising for a bruising, a young lad in Gdansk might once have said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack.

As a result of her injuries and blood loss, this little girl was taken to hospital where, thank God, medics alerted the police.FGM has slipped through the net in the past, perhaps because it is regarded as a “rite of passage”. But the truth is that it is appalling, brutal child abuse.It needs to stop. And, thank goodness, the world is waking up to that fact.Nimco Ali, social activist and co-founder and the director of the Daughters of Eve non-profit organisation, and Helen Whately, Conservative Party Vice Chair for Women, should both be applauded for tirelessly raising this issue.And also the Government, for driving action against FGM globally.Since , the UK has committed £million to support the African-led movement to end FGM, including a package of £million, the biggest single investment by any international donor, which is something to be proud of.This mother’s conviction was a landmark moment. But the fact that it was the first highlights how much more there is to do to protect girls at risk of FGM.Last week marked International Day of Zero Tolerance to FGM, which shows progress, but the reason such a day is needed is because there is still much more to be done.Which brings me to the one step backwards.On Friday, Conservative MP Sir Christopher Chope, the politician perhaps best known for objecting to a bill to outlaw upskirting, stood in the way of legislation designed to protect children from FGM.Specically, he blocked a bill tabled by crossbench peer Lord Berkeley to allow courts to issue protection ordersa child is at risk of FGM.It would be pretty hard to argue that this can only be a good thing. And yet Sir Christopher objected to the bill ahead of its second reading in the House of Commons.This is despite the Government supporting the proposed legislation and wanting to see it pass as a private member’s bill, which is why Government whips reportedly tried to persuade Sir Christopher to drop his objections.But Sir Christopher does not believe private members’ bills are the proper way to amend legislation, because he does not think they receive proper scrutiny.He has said in the past that evenhe backs the intent of a bill, he objects to them because he does not support the procedural principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading.To be clear, the World Health Organisation says there is no medical justication for FGM and the procedure violates the human rights of women and girls. Seriously, what is there to debate about whether the horrendous torture of young women should be allowed or not If Sir Christopher wants to make a point, why doesn’t he do it on less important legislation  I’m pretty sure thathe understood the issues he simply would not bring his point on principal. But also, when you take a stand like this, you really need to be consistent.But apparently Sir Christopher does not object to all private members’ bills —they are proposed by his friends, they get through the net.Unfortunately, with double standards like that it would easy to think he simply doesn’t care about the rights of women and girls — which surely can’t be the case — can it THE Michael Jackson interview, where he was asked directly about his relationship with some of the boys he has been accused of molesting, made for uncomfortable viewing.His nervous giggling on being questioned about molestation allegations against Macaulay Culkin, Jordan Chandler and Brett Barnes comes across as very creepy.But also, you seriously have to wonder why ANY parent would allow their child to stay over at a -year-old man’s house, no matter how immensely wealthy or famous he was.I guess they were wowed by fame – and perhaps Jackson was just hiding in plain sight.JOHN HUMPHRYS is finally going to retire from Radio ’s Today programme – at the grand old age of .Yes, he is a great presenter and ­everything, but it slightly sticks in my craw that you don’t see female presenters ­anywhere near that age on radio or TV. The good news is, that is changing.Fiona Bruce is now presenting Question Time David Dimbleby who was  and Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis are presenting Newsnight.There is a new generation of women who are being given a voice – and it’s bloody brilliant.Here’s hoping that when it comes to their retirement age, the sky’s the limit FOR once, a punishment that fits the crime.Osian Hicks-Thomas has been jailed for six years for killing Rebecca Louise Edwards, , on December  last year when he smashed into her VW Golf while high on alcohol and cocaine.This poor woman suffered serious head injuries in the collision, dying instantly, – while Hicks-Thomas, , fled the scene.He was arrested later, after having made his way to a relative’s house and, thankfully, justice has been served.If you get behind a wheel drunk and high on cocaine and you kill someone, that is murder – plain and simple.I despise drink-driving.I would never even have a sip and get behind the wheel.And the taxi driver who had driven him to his car and knew he was intending to drive it should have reported him to the police before he got behind the wheel and killed someone.AT a time when swimming pools and libraries are routinely being closed – and some people only have their rubbish collected every few weeks – some local councils have forked out on consultants to analyse a clown festival and devise a pantomime strategy.Figures released this week showed that council spending on consultants swelled to nearly £million last year, despite central government urging local authorities to prioritise funds for pressurised front-line services.Clown festival analysis  Pantomime strategy It’s blatantly obvious the money could be better spent.Local councils should publish their intended spending and people should vote on it – and then they should be held accountable.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Claire, who now has more than , followers, first took up running aged  and mapped out her first d**k run by accident in November . It happened when she went out for a jog whilst visiting relatives in Kansas and took a wrong turn.  Now fitness fanatics cant get enough of her d**kruns and have even started to send her their d**kruns of their own. The corporate sector worker said: I encourage anyone and everyone to try a d**krun or two. Someone once sent me their map of a d**kswim, that was pretty impressive actually. I cant swim in a straight line, let alone draw something. The first d**k run was a total accident at first. My brother had moved and I was visiting him. I went for a run and took a wrong turn. When I got back, I realised what I had accidentally drawn. From what I hear, most d**krunners start out this way. Obviously my friends thought it was funny so I kept it up.   Claire has taken part in two marathons, a dozen half marathons since taking up running and is already training for her third marathon in autumn this year. Three-and-a-half years after d**krun was born, Claire says it can be tricky to make each drawing dferent from the one before.  She said: I got into running because it was me time.- although I always love running with friends. Theres nothing like a run to clear your mind and help you reset. The d**kruns are funny but there are some super talented people doing stravaart - really impressive and detailed drawings. It depends on the setting. I like the challenge in more rural areas, because you dont have a lot of roads to work with, so I love finding a random road d**k.  Sometimes theyre super obvious, and I am pretty sure theres a league of town planners and transportation engineers who are all in on some inside joke making road d**ks in their towns. Whilst some d**kruns come naturally, Claire says he spends hours online mapping out new runs. Claire said:: I do spend an inordinate amount of time mapping out d**kruns. I travel for work and for fun, so I map them out anywhere I travel, I have so many mapped that I havent run yet.

Little Tony Hudgell went through hell at six weeks old. In the care of his mother and father, he was swung so violently he suffered eight fractures, resulting in a double-leg amputation. The case led to a ,-signature shypetition being delivered to the House of Commons. It calls for child attack sentences to be brought into line with violent offences, such as GBH with intent, manslaughter and murder. On Tuesday Tony and his tirelessly campaigning adoptive mum Paula Hudgell will be at the House for her MP, Tom Tugendhat’s Ten Minute Bill. The House will debate sentencing, a year after Tony’s natural parents were each jailed for ten years – the maximum for child cruelty or allowing serious harm to a child. Following the motion, Mr Tugendhat will meet Ministry of Justice officials to discuss the shyproposed law change.  Paula, of Kings Hill, Kent, said: “This may be just a small step in the legal process but it is a huge shyachievement for the campaign. “How can it be that those evil enough to intentionally inflict shyappalling abuse on the children they are responsible for loving and shyprotecting face nothing greater than ten years behind bars, and just  yearsdeath is caused ” She said: “No decent human shybeing would think that is right. It is certainly not justice.” Tony had gone with them to the House last month and was shyexcited toand see Big Ben again. Paula said: “When I told him it was to do with the petition we worked so hard for, he replied ‘Yes, I know. It’s for people that are mean to children to go in jail.’” In November , doctors shydiscovered six-week-old Tony had multiple fractures to his tiny body. One to a lower leg joint was so bad it was consistent with the tot being swung by his ankle. He developed multiple organ shyfailure and sepsis , and had to have a double amputation below the knees – the right leg in May  and the left five months later. He now uses “stubbies” to help prepare him for prosthetics in the future – and will start school this year.  Tuesday’s visit to Parliament shycoincides with the four-year shyanniversary of Paula and husband Mark, , meeting Tony, aged four months, in the intensive care of London’s Evelina Children’s Hospital. They fell in love with the tot who weighed lb oz, included the weight of two plaster casts on his severely fractured legs. Casts on his arms had been removed only the previous day. They were introduced to him as his foster parents. Paula said her heart broke as Tony was “on the brink of death”. She stayed with him for  hours then took him home to start his new le with her family. She said: “When I met Tony for the first time he was broken, tiny and shut down. His big, beautul brown eyes showed so much pain and hurt. “Today he is still beautul, but funny, cheeky, full of le and personality. He is a little pickle. My world changed forever that day, I wouldn’t change it for anything.” As soon as he was legally their son, the couple successfully pressed the shypolice and CPS to shyprosecute Tony’s birth parents, Tony Smith and Jody Simpson, . The evil pair were convicted at Maidstone crown court in Kent in February last year of causing or shyallowing physical harm to a child. They were also found guilty of child cruelty relating to their delay in shyseeking medical help for their baby until he was minutes from death.  Appeals against their sentences were subsequently launched, although Simpson later abandoned hers. Smith’s was unsuccessful. Having won justice for her son, Paula has been determined to fight for other children. The mum-of-eight, who is also an NSPCC ambassador, said the pair will be released after five years, even though both received maximum ten year sentences. She said: “Monsters like them deserve far harsher prison sentences. If you are convicted of shykilling someone or intentionally shyinflicting grievous bodily harm, you face a le sentence. “Butyou are found guilty of the offence of causing or shyallowing the death of a child, the most you can be jailed for is  years. Where is the sense in that ” One of Paula’s greatest supporters was her mother, Sheila, , who shysadly died earlier this month after a long battle with cancer. Paula said: “Her last words to me were ‘Don’t give up. Keep fighting for all those babies.’ I won’t let her down.” The Hudgells are trying to raise pound, to make their house fully wheelchair accessible for Tony and to pay for disability equipment.

Lewis Mizen got updates from his frantic mum as the shooting shydominated headlines on TV news channels. Only moments earlier he had been excited about his first Valentine’s date. That was shattered when a fellow student at the ,-pupil high school went berserk with an AR- semi-automatic rle. Lewis, who hails from Coventry, West Mids, fled for cover as Nikolas Cruz killed  pupils and three teachers, and wounded another , in just six minutes.   Thirty students spent  minutes hiding in a closet at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, an hour’s drive north of Miami. Recalling that awful day, the haunted Brit said: “I was happy because, for the first time in the  years of my le, I actually had a girlfriend for Valentine’s Day. “Everyone was wearing pink or red and had massive teddy bears and chocolates. There was a great atmosphere. “We had a fire drill and then,  minutes before school’s out, the fire bell rang again as we were walking outside. “Suddenly one of the teachers or shysecurity guards started yelling ‘Code Red, Code Red, get back inside’. “I got inside and sat under a desk, checking my phone. There was nothing.  “My mum started texting me and said ‘There is a bunch of police cars outside the school, what’s happened ’ “I said, ‘We have a Code Red – an active shooter, but I think it’s a drill’. She said, ‘I don’t think it is, I think it’s real’. “I honestly wasn’t that scared at that moment. It didn’t hit me that is was real until later. Our teacher made us stand up and we had to go into the closet, about  of us, at the back of the room. I couldn’t hear any shots. “We were in there for an hour-and-a-half, and I was seeing CNN images on my phone of the school from overhead with talk of a shooter. “We heard the door to the classroom open and somebody said, ‘Police’. But we didn’t knowit was the police or the shooter. And at that point it really hit me, that my le was actually in danger. “My teacher looked back and said, ‘Do I open it or do I keep it closed’  She opened it and, thank God, it was the police. It was like a sudden jolt.   “At that moment I was terried. Then it was just complete relief, total euphoria that it was the police. They had us run one at a time, guarded by officers and SWAT teams as we headed for the road. When I got home my parents were sobbing and hugging me.” The shooting led to new debate on gun laws and Lewis, now , has become a major international voice on the subject, which ides Americans.He has met ex-British PM Tony Blair and spoken on shyfirearms in Oxford, Dubai and New Zealand. Lewis dismissed President Trump’s endorsement of a plan to arm teachers, which is being considered by state politicians.The teen, now studying international shyrelations at Florida State University, said: “It’s awful. I’ve spoken to a lot of teachers and they hate the idea. “It is terrible psychologically for children to know their teacher has a gun.”  Police say Cruz confessed. Now , he has denied  counts of first-degree murder and  attempted murders. His lawyers may seek a defence of insanity, butconvicted he will end up on Death Row. Lewis has lived in Parkland for most of the past  years with parents David, , and Lisa, . He added: “It was a beautul bubble – the perfect neighbourhood where you could leave your car unlocked. Then the bubble popped. “My family did ask themselvesthey should go back to England. But they realised it’s still a great place.

A spokesman said: A chimpanzee used a broken branch from a tree to briefly leave its enclosure at Belfast Zoo this afternoon. Zookeepers were present as the chimpanzee was quickly ed from an adjacent wall to the rest of the group inside the enclosure.   “Staff are currently assessing how the chimp planned his escape from the enclosure, which is being assessed for storm damage and loose debris following the high winds overnight and into Saturday. “Belfast Zoo would like to thank members of the public who helped raise the alarm as zookeepers moved in tothe animal to its enclosure.” Zoo manager Alan Cairns told the BBC: We think what has happened is that the trees in their enclosure have been weakened by the storms and so theyve been able to break them and use them as a ladder to get out.

He said: Everyone was much more liberated, theyd identy as gay, lesbian, trans, which was a culture shock for me. People were encouraging me to go out and socialise.   He said: It took me quite some time as I felt very anxious, and suicidal, quite depressed. It was a very lonely time. Elders say being gay is Haram and its forbidden, but I read the Quran and the Bible as a student and it doesnt say that as far as Im concerned.Its not what Islam says, but its just what people say. Its a form of Chinese whispers.A year after he moved back to Birmingham at age , Khakan fell in love a Christian man more than  years older - who would later be his le partner. But he revealed how his mum was left traumatised after learning of their relationship. He said: My mother had noted that Id been going out more and queried me one evening and said: Where do you go, who do you meet  I explained I had met somebody. She asked who is she  Then I had to tell her hes a man. She was very shocked, quite traumatised. But asked more questions, was he a young man  What kind of person was he   When I had to say hes older than me, a dferent faith, she was taken aback by it all. But she had to say loved me anyway. She said: Dont say anything to anybody . She could see how upset I was and just wanted me to be happy. I thought whatever they say,it means leaving the family home and they throw me out then Ill have to live with that. And when it came to telling his homophobic father, he was furiously quizzed: What made you this way  My dad was very homophobic, he was very hostile, he would make reference to the Quran, ask what made me this way  Inane comments really, so that was upsetting.  The family started arguing between themselves, so I stepped away for a year to allow them to come to terms with it. One evening my father called me and said I need you to come home and speak to us. I did and that same evening he embraced me and said the reputation in the community is nothing compared to losing a son. However people respond to me saying my son is like this, I am ready with my answers. The happy couple now live in what Khakan calls a gaybourhood-friendly area in the West Midlands and they will be celebrating their th anniversary this year.Khakan set up Birminghams first South Asian LGBT social support group to help offer advice and support to others like him."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons stunning chelsea flower","story":"NewsKate Middletons stunning Cha Flower Show garden design unveiledThe Duchess of Cambridge aims to highlight the benefits of the natural world with her \"Back to Nature Garden\", drawn up alongside two professional landscape architectsShareCommentsByTom Pilgrim:,  FEB NewsThe Duchess of Cambridge with landscape architects Andree Davies and Adam White \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Kate Middleton helped co-design this stunning Cha Flower Show garden.The Back to Nature Garden aims to highlight the benefits the natural world brings to mental and physical well-being.

The expectant mum advises people to use their bathroom glass cleaners - known as squeegees - to help clean their carpets. If a squeegee is scraped over the carpet it will lt up embedded hairs and dust that would just get pushed down by the vacuum cleaner, Liverpool Echo reports.   The expectant mum also said the squeegee is great for getting dirt out of corners - and showed her followers a ball of fluff she had managed to scrape up.

I name all my cloths and cleaning equipment, which may sound odd to some, but it is a laugh for us all and now everyone is getting involved. Its unbelievable.

Parents Joanne and Dan Thompson lost their baby Millie in  after she choked on her food at nursery. Millie was just nine months old. Only then did the couple realise they had never asked questions about how many paediatric first aiders were at the nursery and were shocked to learn the law only requires one person present to be trained in childrens first aid care.As a parent putting your child into nursery, you just assume they will be safe, Joanne told Birmingham Live .We chose the best nursery in our area but it never crossed our minds to ask about how many members of staff were trained in paediatric first aid. As parents, we should be asking these questions. We also need to check the training too because standard first aid doesnt cover childrens first aid. Its also worth asking would you be confidentmy child started choking that you would know what to do    Determined to change things for the better, Joanne and Dan set up a petition calling on nurseries to be better geared up to save childrens lives. It got more than , signatures and the issue was debated in parliament. When the issue was debated, it was decided that the sector was too big for the law to enforce stricter regulations. One result, however, was that every single newly qualied nursery staff has to be trained in paediatric first aid. Joanne and Dan worked with the NDNAto develop Millies Mark - which is awarded to childcare providers where every member of staff is trained in paediatric first aid. The couple also set up Millies Trust - a charity which sets out to make first aid training readily available for minimal costs in as many places as possible.   In order to receive the mark, nurseries must undergo a detailed audit and risk assessment process and indicate strong delivery of paediatric first aid training and understanding amongst colleagues through in-depth training courses. It is a rigorous process which takes around three to six months. There are also spot checks where staff are questioned about first aid scenarios to ensure their knowledge and skills are kept up to date and that staff are confident, ready and capable. Its the worst thing you can ever go through as a parent, said Joanne. You never expect something like this to happen to you. Millie was a funny, happy, smiley little girl who loved to dance, particularly to Paul Simon songs. She was our only child so we lost our family unit and had to go back to being a couple again. Its so hard. I suffered PTSD from what happened and have had treatment for anxiety anddepression. I felt that I couldnt have another child because I couldnt bear going through that again.  After the death of Millie, Joanne was unable to sleep for months and spent her nights talking to parents on Facebook .They were put in a touch with a couple from New Zealand who had lost their baby boy as a result of him choking on an apple at nursery. More than pound, was raised so the couple could visit them in New Zealand. Joanne said: We met them at Aukland Zoo and moved in with them for a couple of weeks. They had two older children and had gone onto have another baby since losing their son. Talking to them and being with them felt so good. We came home and I was pregnant three months later. Joanne and Dan have gone onto have two sons since, Leo, now nearly four, and Asher,  months.   Millies Trust is now a full time job for Joanne and Dan, which they work around looking after their sons. I never wanted to put my other kids into nursery, said Joanne. But we decided to take Leo to one of the nurseries that first got Millies Mark when he was two-and-a-half. He went just two days a week and I found it really tough. The staff helped us a lot before he started because they knew our story. Asher is still at home. Hell go when he gets to a similar age to when his brother started. Its been a horrendous journey and is not something you ever get over but it does get easier. Birthdays, anniversaries and Christmas are the hardest time. People have helped us, most cant believe something like this can happen.   Joanne said: Millie was the perfect baby. She slept through the night from just  days old. I used to feel bad saying that to other parents, that she slept  hours a night and was happy all day. But that was what she was like. She was walking with her walker by the time she started nursery - it was like she started really early because she knew she was going. The boys have pictures of her in their bedrooms, and we go as a family to visit her resting place. It was Leos first journey as a baby. It would have been her seventh birthday on January  and Leo asked he we could hold a party for his sister. We said maybe not a party , but how about a cake  So he went and chose a cake and we lit candles for her. They feel comfortable being there, I hope its somewhere they will continue to go when theyre older. Somewhere where,they have problems, they could contemplate them. I dont like to think of these places as being scary for children, its just where they go to see their sister.   Today, there are  nurseries across the UK that have been given Millies Mark, including lots in the Midlands. Co-op Childcare has now become the UKs first large chain childcare provider to achieve Millies Mark across all  of its nurseries nationwide. So far , practitioners have benefited from the training, with more than , hours committed to the project in total.Parents can put their postcode into the Millies Mark Website to find out which nurseries near them have been accredited with Millies Mark"},{"url":null,"title":"rolf harris ordered not leave","story":"NewsRolf Harris ordered not to leave home alone after walking into school groundsPaedophile Rolf Harris, , walked into the grounds of Oldfield Primary School, in Bray, Berkshire, and waved at schoolchildrenShareByJoshua TaylorDeputy news editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video rolf-harris-leaves-home-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Paedophile Rolf Harris has been ordered not to leave his home without permission after causing outrage by visiting a school.

He should be brought before us to answer questions on this.” Green is said to have groped women and put a female executive in a headlock before dragging her round a room.He is also accused of mocking a black employee’s dreadlocks, allegedly saying he smoked cannabis and was “still throwing spears in the jungle”. The executive, who worked for Green’s Arcadia group, complained and signed a gagging order after getting a payout. The claims were disclosed on Friday after Green dropped a High Court injunction against the Daily , costing him poundmillion. It has emerged three women and two men each signed a gagging clause infor pay-offs. One employee claimed Green referred to a Chinese businessman as “Mr Ching Chong Charlie” and called another worker “Bhaji” and “Curry”.Labour’s Frank Field said the claims needed fresh scrutiny by a Parliamentary committee – six months after the tycoon gave evidence on the collapse of BHS.He said: “He’s able to shut everybody up by giving them pound million. He needs to explain his style of leadership in Parliament.” Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham and Yardley, described Sir Philip’s use of gagging orders as “morally bankrupt”. She said: “This is five dferent people seemingly telling very similar stories about what it’s like to work for him. “They are terrible allegations, and groping and touching are criminal acts. Using NDAs for sexual harassment cases like this is morally bankrupt.” Labour Party chair Ian Lavery said: “If the allegations are true, Philip Green should be stripped of his knighthood. The public expect high standards from public figures and they’re not getting it.” Green has denied unlawful sexual or racist behaviour. Thereported he allegedly groped a female executive and paid her poundmillion to stay silent. It is claimed he slapped her bottom, kissed her face and called her a “naughty girl”. Court documents show Green’s lawyers said his “style is predominately jovial in nature”.

Instead of le with an adoring partner, she ended up broke and suicidal. Tattooed male striper Mark Grace, , saddled her with crippling debts of almost pound, for phones and loans. At one point, she revealed, she was so low she wrote letters to her loved ones as she prepared to drown herself. But Charlotte, , fought back. She spent three years working hard to repay every penny he had cost her. When justice eventually caught up with Grace she discovered she was one of a series of victims he targeted through dating apps and social media And finally she had the satisfaction of watching as he was jailed for six years. “I was minutes away from ending it all when I came my senses,” she said. “I’d spiralled into a dark place.  “Thank God I survived to see him get his just desserts.” Hairdresser Charlotte met charmer Grace on the dating site in January . “I was a sucker for tattoos,” she recalled. “I’ve got a few myself and he had loads. He even called himself Ink Boy on Plenty of Fish. “He was kind, confident and full of compliments. I soon found myself falling for him. “My grandad was poorly at the time, and when I took him to hospital for appointments Mark would come with me. When grandad died, Mark helped ferry relatives home from the funeral. “I couldn’t have wished for a more caring and attentive boyfriend.” Even his revelation that he earned his living as a stripper didn’t put her off. “I was a bit taken aback at first, but he explained there was no sex involved and I told myself. ‘It’s just a job.’ “Everyone has to earn a living somehow. He was quite open about it.” But four months later Grace began stripping... her of cash. She said: “He told me he had a bad credit rating and needed a new phone so clients could call and book him. “He suggested I get myself a new handset at the same time, so I took out contracts for two new iPhones. “He promised he’d pay me each month to cover the fees going out of my account.” But Grace kept both phones – and within days was begging for a loan. “I told him straight. ‘No, I’ve just got two phones for you.’ He went on and on about it, pestering me for days to take out a loan for him. But I didn’t feel comfortable with it and told him so. “Then, about a week later, he just vanished off the face of the earth. “He blocked me on Facebook and Plenty of Fish. He refused to answer calls or texts. I never met his parents or went to his home. I didn’t know where he lived and had no way of reaching him.”  Soon Charlotte began to get letters in her name from two other mobile phone providers chasing payments. Grace had used her details to get more phones. And he’d also used them to borrow money from payday loan firms Wonga and Pounds to Pocket. She said: “I felt sick. Apparently I had an pound loan from Pounds to Pocket but with interest I owed pound,. “Meanwhile Wonga wanted more than pound. I’d never seen a single penny of this yet I was told I was shybehind with payments on both the loans. “I thought I’d end up in court, or lose everything to the bailfs. I felt so foolish and shyembarrassed. I didn’t know which way to turn. “In the end I got a pound shyoverdraft to buy time while I worked out what to do next.” She called the police but they told her it was a civil matter. “I felt helpless,” she said. “I decided I’d have to just take it on the chin, knuckle down and pay the money. The phone contracts alone came to just under pound a month, and I had loan repayments on top. “I was earning minimum wage in a salon and every spare penny I got went to paying the debts. “I did extra work in the evenings doing haircuts for friends and relatives to scrape by. I was in absolute despair, staring into the abyss.”  Then came her lowest moment: “I drove to the river and sobbed my heart out as I wrote letters to everyone I loved. I was going to take a handful of sleeping tablets, walk into the water and go to sleep. “I was sat on a bench beside the river, pills in my hand, when a friend of my gran’s chanced by. “She was chatting away, asking about my family, and it brought me to my senses. I realisedI went through with it, all I’d leave shybehind was pain and suffering – and all because of this idiot Mark Grace. “I ripped up the letters and later that day I shyconfided in my mum.” Charlotte was helped by her local mental health team. And Citizens Advice put her in touch with the debt help charity Step Change. They created a debt management plan that reduced her repayments to affordable sums of between pound and pound a month. In February , having met shysomeone new and given birth to a baby girl, she finally paid off the pound debt . “The day I made my last payment I was dancing around the kitchen singing to my baby daughter, ‘Yay! Mummy’s paid the debts off!’ Then literally an hour later the phone rang. It was the police. “They said they were following up my complaint from  about Mark Grace. “They had him in shycustody and wanted to take a statement. “I was gobsmacked and told them, ‘I wish you’d called sooner – like three years ago.’”  Grace, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, had been arrested after selling a laptop on eBay, pocketing pound but failing to hand over the device. In total, his loan and credit cons had scammed three female and one male victim out of pound,. And in December he was jailed at Norwich crown court for six years for four counts of fraud and one of theft. Charlotte, who now runs her own mobile hairdressing business in King’s Lynn, Norfolk said: “He’d met other girls through Tinder and Facebook, and conned them all just like me. He’d sell them any old sob story to get them to sign up for loans then vanish as soon as he got the cash.” Charlotte believes that without Step Change she wouldn’t have been alive to be in court and see Grace jailed. “They saved my le,” she said. “I want people to know thatyou’re struggling with debt there’s help out there. Talk to someone. “I thought Mark and I had a future together but he’d played me for a total fool. Mark Grace pushed me to the edge but I came back stronger than ever. Now it’s his turn to pay.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young man 22 just five","story":"NewsYoung man, , with just five years to live transforms his body in  weeksOllie Jowett, from St Austell, Cornwall, embarked on a -week fitness programme while battling brain cancerShareCommentsByLee TrewhelaBen KenyonJasmine Rapson:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-makes-incredible-transformation-despite-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old man from Cornwall who may just have five years to live has transformed his body while battling a malignant brain tumour. Ollie Jowett, from St Austell, now has a physique which could be compared to body builders after he embarked on a -week fitness programme which involved intense exercise and strict dieting, all while battling brain cancer. He managed to lose kg and build up muscle even though his health was sometimes so bad, he couldnt walk up stairs. Ollie initially wanted to find work as a personal trainer in his hometown, however he left his le in Cornwall behind after he was offered a job in Belfast, Northern Ireland.His le was turned upside-down just a few months after moving when he was diagnosed with brain cancer, Cornwall Live reports.  Ollie said: “It was a bit of a shock to say the least. There’s only so much crying you can do. I was % from the get go that I would turn a negative to a positive. Le does not stop. I don’t feel sorry for myself because everyone has problems they have to deal with.” “As a personal trainer I know how hard it is for people to lose weight and the excuses people come up with – the lack of motivation, the lack of time, the lack of willpower. I wanted to use my illness to inspire people as well as get myself in the best shape of my le.” Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy arent really options according to Ollie, because they are just so risky.   His health deteriorated at the end of  and he struggled to work long hours, so had to reduce the number of clients he worked with.Ollie then made the decision to start publicly sharing his journey to raise awareness of what le is like with cancer, so he set up an Instagram account called Project Beat Cancer.Since his diagnosis, Ollie has focused on becoming more healthy by exercising and eating a nutrient-rich diet to help his body fight the cancer. -weeks ago Ollie decided to start an online body transformation scheme known as Ultimate Performance in a bid to inspire his clients to push themselves.  He said: The -week transformation was the hardest process of my le. To be honest, there wasn’t a day I didn’t think about giving up. Without a doubt it broke me. “Trying to find the energy just to train and trying to find the energy just to work is horrendous. But despite my health being the problem, it was my health that was my motivation in the first place. I had to constantly keep reminding myself of this when I wanted to give up. “It wasn’t just to get a six-pack. That wasn’t the purpose. The purpose was to get to the end so that I could inspire other people with my story.”  Ollie said there were highs and lows throughout the programme - and some days were completely impossible when his symptoms were at their worst. However the guidance and support of his trainer helped push him through the hardest points. He added: Some days I would feel too weak to even walk up a flight of stairs. It can get that bad. Even walking down to the shop can be dficult, let alone doing , steps. “I would just do what I could do and that was the commitment I had to myself and to my trainer Umar and to this process. “The training was hard. It’s not going to be easy. If you want to get in the best shape of your le, it’s not going to be a walk in the park. “There were quite a few days with my cancer where I was ill and I just said to him that I’ve not been able to train, or I’ve been in bed all day because I’ve been really ill. He has been completely empathetic and understanding around that.” While he is pleased to have improved his body, Ollie says the most important benefits of the fitness regime is he has now stronger mentally, physically and emotionally. He said: “Looking good doesn’t hurt either. It does a few things for the Tinder likes, anyway.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horrified woman wakes up after","story":"NewsHorried woman wakes up after liposuction to find doctor has given her new noseA woman has shared the shocking tale of how she went to a doctor for liposuction but woke up to find hed done something  to herShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video e-mariela-went-liposuction-new-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt sounds like something straight out of a nightmare.

But a closer inspection of the luxury villa near Marbella revealed the remains of bloodstains on the floor outside the garage. This was the scene of the execution-style shymurder of a millionaire nightclub boss who shypartied with stars of The Only Way Is Essex. Marco Yaqout’s death last month is part of an escalating turf war fought by gun-toting drug gangs on Spain’s Costa del Sol. Marbs draws six million Brits a year, hoping for a taste of the high le shyenjoyed by Premier League footballers and reality TV stars like Mark Wright . But a Sunday People investigation found people living in fear in an area awash with drug dealers and sex workers – where the murder rate has shot up nearly  per cent. A source close to the probe into Yaqout’s murder told us: “Gangsters have always been operating in the Costa del Crime but we’ve never seen anything on this scale before.  “The Irish gangs who used to shydominate the coast are rumoured to have packed off to Dubai, which has created a vacuum here. “The Moroccans have moved in and are more devil may care with their methods. That’s why we are seeing shyassassinations in broad daylight.” One expat told us he was thinking of selling up and moving back to the UK because of the violence. Simon, who would not give his full name, said: “Me and my we don’t feel safe any more. A bomb went off in Puerto Banus the other day.” And -year-old worker Esquiel said: “There’s a big problem here in the Costa del Sol with prostitution and drugs. “It’s going to ruin tourism. We rely on Brits for the summer but gangs are walking around with guns in broad shydaylight. It’s getting like a war zone.” Ignacio Carrasco, General Secretary for the Civil Guard, has called for a “national emergency” to be declared.  He told us: “We’re in a spiral of shyviolence which will only get worse.” Between January and October last year the murder rate in the Malaga province – which includes Marbella – increased by . per cent compared with the same period in , according to the Spanish Interior Ministry. Seven out of  murders in those  months were in Marbella. They don’t include the shooting of bomb maker Hamza Ziani in a sushi restaurant and the machine-gun murder of a man aged  outside his home in November. In nearby Estepona, tourists fled as two gunmen shot a man  times outside a Mister Noodles restaurant. Witness Elisa Menendez, , said: “It was carnage. You could see the bullets sprayed all over the floor. Gangs have existed here for years but the types of gangs are changing.” So-called ‘baby-gangsters’ from the UK are also getting caught in the crossfire.  In November a -year-old Brit was stabbed twice in the legs in the street in Puerto Banus. And Craig Moran, , who was jailed in  over an armed raid in which a Nottingham jeweller died, was abducted in Marbella, shot in the legs and slashed from ear to ear. But it was the killing of nightclub chief Yaqout – dubbed the Prince of Banus – which truly shocked locals. Yaqout, , from Morocco, owned five nightspots in Puerto Banus, including Towie shyfavourite TIBU. Mark Wright, , hosted a boat party and club night there in . And singer Professor Green, , shyhosted a night in .  A hitman waiting shyoutside Yaqout’s villa in San Pedro de Alcantara shot him  times as he drove his Bentley into his garage. Local reports say he had close ties to Irish criminal kingpin Daniel Kinahan. Giles Brown, a pal of Yaqout, said: “It was a targeted hit. Everyone has been very shocked. His clubs were big clubs. He shywelcomed celebrities and was a well-known figure.” Police feel powerless to control the violence shybecause of cutbacks, poor equipment and red tape. The rate of unsolved crimes in Marbella has increased by . per cent to . per cent.  Top cop Marilo Valencia, who has two decades of experience in the area, said: “Police numbers and resources are not what they should be. We are conscious when police from abroad cooperate with us on operations, that they have much more advanced technology than ours. It should be normal, for instance, that officers should be equipped with Tasers. “We need a sole state police force instead of the current situation where two dferent forces, the National Police and the Civil Guard, police areas like the Costa del Sol.” The Costas are down  police officers, with  fewer in Marbella. The numbers were slammed by Marbella council spokesman Diego Escalone as shy“historical lows”.  As police lose shycontrol, drugs are openly touted and the streets and clubs are awash with sex workers. Minutes after setting foot on Marbella’s famous strip in the high end marina Puerto Banus, we were offered group sex and cocaine, with free booze thrown in. Our reporter and photographer were told two women could be provided for  euros, with a further  for coke. Keen for a deal as rain lashed the palm trees, one girl said: “We have an shyapartment round the corner, let’s go.”  Spurning the offer, we found more hookers at upmarket club La Sala, where ex-England and Spurs footballer David Bentley is a shareholder. One drinker told us: “They are all working girls here but more high-class than the port ones. They are here shybecause there’s money. “Every beautul female around you see is  euros. You can spot them because they are eyeing men up.” A hostess at the venue said staff were powerless to kick out the hookers and police turn a blind eye. The rise of the sex shyworkers has become so shyblatant that some British visitors shyhave even complained about their presence on TripAdvisor. One of the girls said: “We love Englishmen because they are rich. We all want the footballers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture boy 6 beheaded","story":"NewsFirst picture of boy, , beheaded with piece of glass in front of screaming mumZakaria Al-Jaber was butchered in Medina, Saudi Arabia \"for being the wrong branch of Islam\" as he visited a shrine to the Prophet Muhammad, reports sayShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video footage-funeral--year-old-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the first picture of a tragic six-year-old boy who was beheaded in front of his screaming mum .

tayside","story":"It’s a fact of le that every month millions of women around the globe have to deal with “the curse” of their period.At best it can be inconvenient and at worse it can be excruciatingly painful and have a signicant impact on day-to-day le.And it causes enough problems without the added panic of finding the money to buy the necessary sanitary products.Period poverty is now recognised as being a real problem, with thousands of women – including many in Dundee and across Tayside – having to use items such as socks, newspapers and rags to cope with their period.That’s why food waste charity FareShare Dundee has launched a scheme to make sure no woman has to face the embarrassment of being caught with no period protection when needed.Amanda O’Connell, the organisation’s community development worker for sanitary protection, said it had been supplying free sanitary products in Dundee since last December.She said: “We are based in Dundee but cover the whole of Tayside and Fe.“We are already supplying sanitary products to  local organisations with almost , women and girls benefitting each month.“This number is increasing constantly as we continue to partner many new organisations.“We are reaching a wide iety including foodbanks, job clubs, family support services, youth groups and homeless services.“We are also soon to begin delivering training and educations workshops throughout the region regarding period poverty.”Amanda said that as well as providing practical support, the group also aims to raise awareness of the issues.She said: “It’s about giving women their dignity.“We want to break down taboos and reduce stigma associated with period poverty and work with women and learn from their experiences of period poverty.“Women shouldn’t have to make a choice between feeding their family and buying themselves sanitary protection.“They shouldn’t have to stay at home during their period because they are frightened to go out because of leakage.”Amanda said she had heard stories about women using anything they had to hand to deal with their period, including socks, rags and even newspaper.“We want to make sanitary products as easily accessible as possible and we want to end the embarrassment many women facethey have to ask for products.” she said.“We’re also reaching out to men as we want them to feel comfortable picking up products for their daughters, wives and sisters or whoever the women in their lives are.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5d5f4450cf58.95654923.jpg

companies to bid for a contract to develop the existing market by identying what it calls “innovation and development opportunities”.It would mean the council handing over full responsibility for the market to an external provider responsible for managing staff as well as being the first point of contact for any issues.The deal could even see the market expanding beyond its current offering of up to  stalls, subject to approval by the local authority.However, it will not cost the council any money, with the successful bidder instead taking a cut of the market’s income.A document included with the council’s tender detailing exactly how the handover would work said: “The market operator has the opportunity to expand the Farmers’ Market beyond the  leased stalls by providing their own additional stalls.“The additional market stalls are subject to theapproval.“The market operator will act as the first point of contact for traders and shall ensure adequate supervision of all staff.”At present, Dundee’s monthly market offers produce from local firms including  Brewing, Arbroath Fisheries, gin distilled by Eden Mill and Arbroath ceramics firm Eeksie Peeksie.Despite handing over the reins to an external operator, the council has insisted local goods remain the flavour of the month.The procurement document continued: “Wherever possible and without contravening any legal requirement, the service provider should endeavour to purchase local produce.“The market operator should operate purchasing practices that maximise reduction of ‘food miles’.”City development convener Lynne Short said expanding the market was a good way to encourage more spending.She said: “I very much enjoy the fact we can take advantage of the space we have in the city centre for markets like this, which can be used by local businesses.“A pound spent in local shops in the city centre will likely stay in the city.”The deal is guaranteed for a year, starting this April, with an option to

St Mirren out of the cup.The former Aberdeen forward joined the Tangerines last week from English League Two side MK Dons and immediately impressed, scoring and playing a vital role in last weekend’s - win over Morton at Tannadice.It was an ideal start for Pawlett and the other new faces brought in during a busy January window and he wants the Tangerines to keep that up at the Simple Digital Arena tomorrow.The pressure of the Championship title race may be lted this weekend but heading to a Premiership club in the fth round of the Scottish Cup is no small matter to the club. vw, px\"  Pawlett said: “We can enjoy it this weekend but we want to progress, it’s not like it’s a free weekend or anything being off league duty.“We all want to get through –we can keep winning, keep the momentum going that’s what we want.“You want to win every game and the Scottish Cup is a massive competition, you want to get as far as possible in it and we want to continue where we left off last weekend, work hard, enjoy our football and, hopefully, we’ll do alright.“We know St Mirren is a tough place to go but I think we can get a result.“They are a Premiership side and we need to test ourselves at that level.“It’ll be tough but we’re confident in each other and trust each other we can get a result.”Pawlett admits it’s been a strange time at the club with  new players coming in during January.“It’s unbelievable really and a lot of the lads are saying it feels like pre-season again with all the new faces.“The boys here already have been really welcoming and the lads have settled in really well.“That’s good because there’s no time to settle in, we need to hit the ground running.”And, for the -year-old, it almost is like pre-season, with the majority of his - campaign spent in the physio’s room.He added: “I broke my foot in the first game of the season –  seconds in to the first game.“After all the pre-season and getting up to speed,  seconds in I was out for four months which was really tough.“It was a tough start to the season for me but I feel strong now, rehab was good and there’s no issues with my foot.“Morton was my third start of the season. It basically is the start of the season for me and I have so many games left to finish up on a positive note.“I’m hungry, I know the challenge here to get back to the Premiership and that’s the aim.”As well as a fresh start away from his injury woes in Milton Keynes, Pawlett is delighted to be reunited with boss Robbie Neilson.It was the United gaffer who took Pawlett south of the border with MK Dons at that point in League One after leaving Aberdeen.Pawlett added: “I’ve, obviously, worked with the manager before so I know what to expect and I really enjoy working under him.“I like his passion, his thought-process fits with the way I play, I think, and I get on with him really well.“We have an understanding from each other – I know what he wants and he knows what he’s going to get from me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5d60e73d9760.05654911.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee have signed a fresh team but are these new men any good","story":"There’s a fresh look about Dundee these days after manager Jim McIntyre made sweeping changes to his squad over January.Eleven new players came in – enough to make up a whole new team – as the Dark Blues look for a way out of the relegation mire they’ve found themselves in.Ten of the  have already made their debuts and today the Tele will have a look at what they’ve shown and what might be to come.Seny DiengIt’s not all been plain sailing for the Swiss goalie after his mis-cued clearance led to Hamilton’s equaliser at the weekend but he’s been an assured presence overall between the sticks.On loan from QPR, the -year-old is still learning his trade but he’s made some vital stops already and commands his area well. Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5c36d3189f97.74208600.jpg ","title":"gordon forest backs dundee united to carry on good form against st mirren","story":"Assistant head coach Gordon Forrest has hailed the “leadership” shown by Dundee United’s new recruits.Despite a large chunk of the club’s  new signings arriving on deadline day, manager Robbie Neilson’s assistant Gordon says players like Mark Reynolds, Mark Connolly, Calum Butcher and Peter Pawlett have already shown they’ve got the character to take the Tangerines to the next level.That level is the Premiership and they’ll get a taste of that this weekend when travelling to top-flight St Mirren on Saturday.And Gordon is backing the Tangerines to repeat the display in their - win over Morton last weekend.He said: “The new players didn’t have much contact with the staff and the other players but straight away you could see on the pitch they were right behind what we are trying to do as a club.“There was a good energy about the guys, they were passionate and a bit of leadership came out on the pitch as well. It was so pleasing to see how they slid into that game but also they’ve been on the training pitch this week and it seems like they’ve been here a while.“It can take time to bed in but we can’t have that with  games to go.“It was important we got players in with the right character and mentality and we knew they would fit in straight away.“It’s been great and credit to them for that but also credit to the players already here for reaching out and bringing them in.”The club are hoping for a sell-out of away tickets at St Mirren this week with , of their , allocation already taken up."},{"url":null,"title":"no thanks dundee fans group rejects owners bid for full control of club","story":"Dundee’s most influential supporters group has politely knocked back a bid from Dark Blues owner Tim Keyes to take complete control at Dens Park.Last month it emerged the American millionaire wanted to buy the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society’s ‘A’ Ordinary Shares to take his overall stake in the club to over %.That would have ended the DFCSS’s power of veto over matters like a change of ownership, merger, moving to a new stadium and even substantial borrowing.That’s a condition of the sale of the majority holding Texas-based Keyes took on back in .Only the ‘A’ Ordinary shares that were created then, and are held by the society, include that power of veto.After consulting their -plus members, however, the society have given a thanks but no thanks to the plan for them to be sold.In doing so, however, they have stressed their support “in principal” for the plan to move to a new stadium near the city’s Campderdown Park.And they have stressed their willingness to consider any proposal from Dundee on its merits.The decision of the society’s board reflected the feedback after consulting members.Of that number just over half indicated a preference for holding onto the ‘A Ordinary’ shares but were willing to see a relaxation of certain rights to allow the stadium development to go ahead.Some % were in favour of maintaining the status quo, while % were willing to see the shares sold and a new shareholders agreement negotiated.Another issue is the fact while the existing rules of the DFCSS allow them to buy shares, there is no provision for the sale of any they hold.As well as informing their members, the society board have told Dundee of their decision. It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

However, a good friend of the museum has stepped forward with the offer and agreed to allow Dunadd Community Enterprise time to explore the possibility of buying the building and make a final decision that any community use has the full support of its members and is sustainable.Since the Church of Scotland moved to its new premises in Kilmartin, it has been its intention to sell Kilmartin Church and the Glebe, as well as the churches in Ford, Kilmichael Glassary and Kilmichael of Inverlussa. Kilmartin Museum has been in discussions with the Church of Scotland about buying the Glebe to use for their education programmes, and to develop overflow parking in a small area to accommodate the extra visitors expected when the redeveloped museum opens in .At the recent AGM, members of Dunadd Community Enterprise supported the committee to go ahead with seeking funding to commission a full feasibility study that would explore sustainable community use of the building. Funds would be required to buy, renovate and convert the church.There have been lots of ideas and discussion, but careful business planning is required to ensure whatever the church is used for would attract grant funding and crucially, would be sustainable in the long term. This will take some time and funding needs to be sought for a feasibility study in the first instance, so Dunadd Community Enterprise could not currently buy the church.Kilmartin Museum already has funding in place to purchase the Glebe Field, and they need to go ahead with this to keep to their redevelopment project timescales. However, the benefactor has said it will be possible to maintain public access to the historic stones housed in the church and that the museum can also use the building while the building work required during the redevelopment project is taking place.Dr Sharon Webb, museum director said: ‘It would have been a real shamethe church and the historic stones had become inaccessible, and this decision by the church head office could have presented real dficulties to both the museum and community enterprise, so it’s great that a temporary solution has been found. It’s wonderful that there are such generous and philanthropic people who want to make a dference to both the museum and the local community.’David Bracken, chairman of the Dunadd Community Enterprise, added: ‘This gives us the time we need to explore all the possibilities and make sure thatwe do go ahead and raise funds to buy the church, it’s the right thing for the community now, and for future generations.’Negotiations between the Church of Scotland head office and the anonymous buyer are ongoing."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert blow after festivals funding bid rejected","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is undeniably the festival capital of Argyll, but organisers say two summer events in the fishing village will be #diminished# after council cash was refused.Tarbert Enterprise Company submitted bids to Argyll and Bute Council#s Strategic Events and Festivals Grant Scheme for three events # Tarbert Scottish Series , Tarbert Music Festivaland Tarbert Seafood Festival .The bids for the music and seafood festivals were rejected in their entirety, while the Scottish series yachting event was granted £,.John Hardie, chairman of Tarbert Enterprise Company, said the two high-profile summer festivals would be #diminished# after failing to receive council support.#It#s pretty devastating when you think you#ve put a good bid together,# said Mr Hardie.He questioned why three large events # Cowal Highland Gathering, Tiree Music Festival and Oban Live # should receive around  per cent of the total funding allocation of £,.Mr Hardie asked: #Are these events being generously funded at the expense of others #He added: #A contribution would have been acceptable.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

It should pave the way for further concerted action.Dr Duncan McCormick, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lothian, said: ldquoWe are very clear in our commitment to and responsibility for identying and treating children and women at high risk of FGM in Lothian.ldquoIt is a form of abuse and gender based violence that has serious short and long term physical and psychological consequences, andany health professional has concerns they have a responsibility to share that information to safeguard the wellbeing of women and children.ldquoFGM is a hugely complex and sensitive issue that requires health professionals to approach the subject carefully. We need to ask the right questions in a straightforward and sensitive way to establish the understanding and relationship needed to ensure that the girl or woman, and her family members, are given the care, protection and safeguarding they need.An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: ldquoWe have no confirmation that FGM is being practised in Scotland, however there is intelligence that cutting does happen where in the UK.ldquoThere is a clinic at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, run by the SNIPS team , which sees all women who have disclosed FGM.ldquoFor the most part, they do not need any treatment and will more than likely go on to have a normal birth.ldquoA small number of women are referred to the gynaecological services. Of those who are referred, some request no treatment in the antenatal period, and would rather wait for the intrapartum period, which is the recommendation from The World Health Organisation.Minister for Older People and Equalities Christina McElvie MSP said: ldquoFGM is an abhorrent practice, a form of abuse and a violation of the human rights of women and girls.ldquoScotland already has robust laws in place to tackle this illegal practice and we are taking action to prevent and eradicate FGM and ensure that public and third sector services stand ready to support those at risk.ldquoWe want to strengthen protections further, introduce protection orders for women and girls at risk and place guidance for professionals on a statutory footing."},{"url":null,"title":"kates-plans-for-chelsea-flower-show-garden-revealed","story":"The ldquoBack to Nature Garden aims to highlight the benefits the natural world brings to mental and physical well-being.Kate has co-designed the woodland wilderness garden alongside landscape architects Andree Davies and Adam White, and the Royal Horticultural Society .Her involvement with the  RHS Garden at the Cha Flower Show was first revealed in January.Kensington Palace said in a statement the garden will help ldquoinspire families to get outside and explore nature together.It added: ldquoThe garden hopes to trigger memories of time spent in nature, and encourage others to go out and create new experiences in the great outdoors.The gardenrsquos centrepiece will be a high  tree house, clad in stag horn oak that draws inspiration from a bird or animal nest.It will also feature a swing seat, rustic den and a campfire as well as tree stumps, stepping stones and a hollow log for children to play on.Interaction with the natural environment will be encouraged through the gardenrsquos ldquomulti-sensory, green and blue plant scheme.The design also includes ldquoincredible edibles, plants for craft activities, ldquoforest scents and a range of plants, shrubs and trees of dferent heights and textures.A waterfall and stream will provide an opportunity for children to paddle and play.In creating the garden, Kate is following in the footsteps of her father-in-law the Prince of Wales, whose passion for horticulture is well known."},{"url":null,"title":"what-the-papers-say-february-10","story":"The Sundayprints a further allegation against retail tycoon Sir Philip, who has denied his behaviour was criminal or amounted to gross misconduct.The front page of tomorrows Sunday : Greens firm, the missing evidence and claims of a cover-up #tomorrowspaperstoday pic hbRBavTmdash The February , The Sunday Times leads with its investigation into dating app age limits, exposing how some adults exploit soft controls to commit crimes against children.SUNDAY TIMES: Revealed: the child victims of dating apps #tomorrowspaperstoday pic JxwYlOOfrmdash Helen MillerFebruary , The Sunday Express says a headteachersrsquo union is backing a planned strike by pupils over climate change.SUNDAY EXPRESS: Head teachers support pupil strike #tomorrowspaperstoday pic KiIBXMGomdash Helen MillerFebruary , The Sunday Mirror has spoken to a woman who was injured when the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Land Rover Freelander collided with another car last month, after it emerged the duke has voluntarily surrendered his driving licence.Tomorrows front page: Ill feel safer now hes off roads#tomorrowspaperstoday https:t.co xopqZGMbB pic zfToiRkLmdash Sunday MirrorFebruary , The Observer leads with calls for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to be sacked after the collapse of a controversial no-deal Brexit ferry contract.The Observer front page, Sunday  February : Sack Grayling over the Brexit ferry fiasco, demand MPs pic lXZCidFrczmdash February , The Independent highlights the countdown to Brexit.

She studies in Glasgow and works as a waitress in her spare time.She would like to stay in Scotland after Brexit, and many of her friends would, too.ldquoI know a lot of Lithuanians here, and a I know a lot of international students and Scottish people, and I never felt judged that I was not Scottish.But while most say that there has been little hostility since June , some in Scotland have felt stigma towards immigrants far more keenly.Ievita VaitkunaiteCarmen Fernandez, , moved from Spain seven years ago and works as a cook for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.She says she avoids speaking Spanish in public because she fears physical assault.ldquoI sometimes hear comments in the media about people being attacked just for speaking another language, she says.ldquoI try to avoid speaking Spanish on the street.ldquoJust in case ndash it depends which area Irsquom in. If I want to phone my family, I prefer to do it in the house. It depends who is around me.She especially worries for the future of her son and both of their residency in the UK.ldquoMy son is now , and has studied in Scotland, she says.ldquoHe feels more Scottish than Spanish, but he is in the same position as me, in limbo.ldquoI always felt very welcome in the UK before, and I donrsquot feel that welcome any more.Fran Cueller, another Spaniard who works in a primary school, also worries about opportunities for the next generation.ldquoI am a school teacher, so I see that my children will be okay because they have dual nationalities and they will be able to move freely between Europe and here, but I see the children in the school and a lot of them will not have the chance as it seems right now, he says.ldquoAnd I think thatrsquos a great experience in anyonersquos le, to travel and meet new people.Margarita Bhosale, who moved over from Lithuania before separating from her partner, wonders what the impact of Brexit will be on her children.She explains: ldquoMy children were born here, they speak Scottish. Itrsquos their home, this is where they base their traditions on.ldquo I donrsquot even know whatrsquos going to happen so therersquos no point trying to explain it to them.In order to avoid hostility in the aftermath of what she sees as an inevitable no-deal Brexit, Lindis Kipp, who has dual German and British citizenship, is stockpiling.ldquoI have a stockpile of non-perishable foods, nappies and cat litter, tins of beans, fruit and pasta. Itrsquos not because I think we will run out of food so badly and people are going to starve, but Scotland is at the very end of the supply line in Britain.ldquoIrsquom trying to avoid going to the supermarket in the first couple of weeks after a no-deal Brexit when it gets really panicky and people start being horrible to each other.As well as revealing tension across national borders, some EU citizens reveal more familiar fault lines in the Brexit debate.Morena Ianzo, , has been in Scotland less than a year and has picked up on the sentiment that the older generation were the driving force behind Brexit.ldquoThe older generation doesnrsquot have a sense of whatrsquos going on any more, she says.ldquoThey donrsquot have to live in this country post-Brexit, because judging by the age that voted yes, theyrsquore not all going to be here in  years time, probably.ldquoSo it doesnrsquot really affect them that much ndash they voted for a country theyrsquore not going to live in.

I learned to swim in there. I remember when I was a teenager we used to occasionally go down there to the skating because that is the place you went to maybe meet lassies at the weekend.\"He chuckles softly. \"Butyou couldnt skate, you werent going to meet anybody, slipping around the edges. One of the first jobs I did out of drama school was a panto at the Magnum.\"Having suitably recovered from my accidental bombshell, our conversation turns to his role as everyones favourite brooding detective inspector Jimmy Perez which will see the -year-old actorto our screens for a fth series this week.It has been quite the journey so far. Did Henshall imagine when he embodied Perez for that two-part pilot which aired in  ndash adapted from the novel Red Bones by crime writer Ann Cleeves ndash that he would inhabit the character for seven years and counting \"Obviously, no,\" he says, wryly. \"Because you never know. I thought he was an interesting character and there was possibility. But I didnt think it would last very long in that two-part format. I wasnt particularly interested in doing another cop show that way because it is a pretty dated concept.\"The Scandis blew the crime genre out of the water and the Americans have been doing interesting things with it for years. We had to be brave and follow on with that. I was trying to convince them from the beginning to do six hours on one story.\"Testament to that early vision, Shetland has evolved into a six-part series. Previous storylines have shone a spotlight on a miscarriage of justice and laid bare the emotional aftermath of rape, with the latest instalment centring on the hidden brutality of human trafficking.It opens with a young man inexplicably alone and shivering on a windswept hillside. He is last seen walking towards a vehicle. A few days later, a jogger discovers a severed hand on the beach, while a holdall found at nearby inlet reveals grisly contents: a human head.Forensic tests confirm that they belong to the same victim, a visitor spotted passing through Lerwick. As Perez and the team scrutinise CCTV, emails and social media accounts, the investigation takes an even darker and more sinister twist.\"People trafficking, refugees and migration is a huge issue in Europe and indeed all over the world at the present moment,\" says Henshall. \"But the ways in which that starts and the abuses that take place during the course of peoples journeys has certainly opened my eyes.\"[It has opened them] to the places that can happen and the very insidious ways it happens in places you would never imagine and by seemingly respectable people.\"Shetland has always deftly sidestepped the gratuitous violence and so-called \"misery porn\" that many crime dramas trade on, instead forging its own path through weighty subject matter and thought-provoking themes.Henshall casts his mind back to series three when Perezs colleague DS Alison \"Tosh\" McIntosh ndash played by the brilliant Alison ODonnell ndash was raped.\"When I heard that Tosh was going to be raped, I was aghast,\" he says. \"Because I thought, Why would we do that  Ninety percent of the time when you see rape on the television it is gratuitous and there to either bolster viewing figures or as a lazy way of treating female cast.\"Thankfully our show, at that time, was very much headed up by women, which has benefited us hugely. The way in which we approached that ndash how it was written and carried out ndash I thought it was much more responsible and the way it should be done.\"A lot of it is down to our writers and the people who produce our show. Then, of course, you have actors and directors who are empathetic and capable of being able to perform things like that.\"Tosh didnt feature in Cleeves books: Perezs bright and ambitious right-hand woman is the brainchild of the shows lead writer David Kane whose past credits include The Field of Blood, Stonemouth, Sea of Souls, Taggart and Rebus.\"Davey Kane is somebody who likes women and I think that comes across,\" says Henshall. \"Everything he has ever written ndash and I have known Davey for, Christ, over  years ndash he likes women. Tosh is his invention and he has been writing women like that for as long as I have known him.\"There is a great deal of responsibility that goes into the subject matter and how it is explored. It is never for the sake of it because there are too many good bulls*** detectors in our set-up for it to get passed.\"Would Henshall call out that kind of thing  \"Absolutely,\" he says, a steely glint in his eye. \"Because I am front and centre, I have to be able to stand up and support whatever we do.\"He speaks highly of his Shetland co-stars, yet Henshall can be his own worst critic. \"Im not very good at being objective about myself,\" he admits. \"I tend to think: What are you doing  Look at you, you big, bleary-eyed, fat f***.\"Cleeves bid farewell to Perez in her final Shetland novel, Wild Fire, last autumn. Im fully expecting Henshall to wax lyrical about the character living on within the small screen but he instead throws a curveball. \"Yeah, Im not sure how many more miles it has got,\" he says. \"But well see.\"The youngest of three children, Henshall grew up in Barrhead and as a teenager joined the Scottish Youth Theatre. His late mother was a nurse while his father, a retired salesman, recently ed to live in Barrhead following several years in Cyprus.After leaving school, Henshall trained at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London and later did a stint with the : company in Glasgow.His first television acting role was as a motorcyclist in Taggart Peter Mullan and Ewen Bremner before going on to parts in Dennis Potters Lipstick on Your Collar and the films Angels and Insects, Orphans and Its All About Love.Recent years have brought high-profile roles in the popular time-travelling drama Outlander and playing police detective William Muncie in the ITV mini-series In Plain Sight, about the Lanarkshire serial killer Peter Manuel.Last year Henshall spent six months opposite Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston and Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery in an acclaimed National Theatre production of Network. The actor says that he would happily do a play every yearhe could.There has been a change of scene too. In November, he moved to Glasgow with his we Tena Stivicic, a Croatian-born playwright and screenwriter, and their two-year-old daughter Anja Grace. Slowly but surely, says Henshall, the trio are settling into their new home in the citys west end.\"I have never lived in Glasgow before,\" he says. \"It is slightly discombobulating because Im very used to it over the last seven years but not for living here. I lived in London for  years, so it is quite odd, but we are in a lovely part of town.\"What prompted their move  \"Mainly my daughter. We needed to move to somewhere bigger. We couldnt really afford that in London. We could have bought somewhere but I would have been mortgaged up to my neck and probably had a stroke in  years. I thought, Its not worth it.\"Then there is the thing with schools in London. We have got pals who are having to go to church on a Sunday just to get their daughter into a decent school ndash catchment areas are the size of a -bob bit.\"There is something to be said for kids growing up in London becausethey grow up there, they can go anywhere. But we werent sure that we wanted her growing up quite that quick.\"We could get a house here that we would never be able to get in London. Our quality of le is going to be an awful lot better. But Glasgow wasnt the only place we were thinking of moving to.\"Somewhere more rural, perhaps  \"Oh, God no. Coming from London, this feels like I have moved to the country,\" laughs Henshall. \"We were thinking about Glasgow but then, why not Zagreb where Tena is from \"Then we thought we could maybe go to Los Angeles for a year ndash my we and I have both got representation there ndash but it was Tena who said: Lets find somewhere in Glasgow.\"And is she settling in  He nods. \"Yeah, but I think she is still in the slight mourning phase for London.\"Henshall alludes to his own sense of mourning. \"The only thing I really miss since we came up here is the theatre. Because the theatre scene in Glasgow is dead.\"Why does he think that is  \"The fact that consecutive governments in Scotland still see the arts as a hobby. That is why we are still talking about film studios in Scotland. I have been talking about it for  years ndash and we are still talking about it.\"It is not seen as a viable, money-making, profit-making industry. It is still seen by the people in power as a hobby. And it is a disgrace that people are still that ignorant after this amount of time.\"Hes warming to his theme now. \"The Citizens Theatre in Glasgow used to be one of the most important theatres in Europe. Now it is some wee provincial place. I dont careanybody is offended by that ndash that is what it looks like now. It is a disgrace.\"Does he envisage that might change after the Citzs pound.m refurbishment  \"No, I dont. Because you have to get an audience in. The great thing that Giles [Havergal], Philip Prowse and Robert David MacDonald did was to make a theatre in Gorbals a community theatre.\"That takes work and imagination. It takes will and a great deal of ambition. You need somebody like that running a theatre who has got an ambition. It is a disgrace and an outrage. It makes me so angry.\"Thats where I first started going to the theatre,\" he continues. \"I was , sitting up in the gods, getting in for p and watching Schiller and all these amazing plays that I would never in a million years have seen. That is what stoked my imagination.\"His response is no less impassioned as we move on to talk about the long-mooted plans for a Scottish film and television studio. At the present time, two sites have been earmarked one in Saltersgate, near Dalkeith in Midlothian, and a second at the Port of Leith.Does Henshall reckon the idea will ever come to fruition  \"It will be a cheap version of it they will claim as a victory,\" he says. \"That preposterous notion of building it on the other side of Edinburgh is just dumb.\"It should either be somewhere practical like Stirling, which is in the centre and you can get everywhere from there, or it should be in Glasgow because you have where all those shipyards used to be. Regenerate that. Because Glasgow could really do with it.\"What  does he plan to reacquaint himself with now hes back in Scotland  \"The countryside. The food scene in Glasgow is fantastic. Seeing old pals and integrating myself into the city.\"Henshall is a fascinating and challenging interviewee: both guarded and gregarious, which makes him tricky to read at times. He has a killer poker face. There are a couple of moments when I fear hes been offended by my line of questioning, only for him to segue into a cheerful anecdote.As a youngster, Henshall played a lot of tennis and laments the loss of his old childhood stomping ground. \"There was a tennis club in the middle of Arthurlie Park and for whatever reason it has been torn down,\" he says. \"That is a travesty given how popular tennis ought to be in Scotland.\"An anterior cruciate ligament injury put paid to his own tennis-playing aspirations ndash \"I buggered my knee on a film years ago\" ndash and these days Henshall is into cycling. \"I have a road bike ndash a purist,\" he says. \"It is kind of my midle crisis, I guess.\"To be fair, there are far worse ways to exhibit a midle crisis. \"Thats what I said to my we when I was justying the amount of money I paid for my bike,\" he grins. \"I said, Its not a Ferrari, its not a Harley-Davidson and its not an affair with somebody half my age. It is just a bicycle.\"One bike can become two can become three hellip \"Thats the other great thing,\" he says. \"When my we meets other people, who have six or seven bicycles, Im like, I have one hellip\" For now  \"One is fine. Although we have got room in our house now, so I could, but I think she might shoot me.\"He clearly craves the outdoors le, something Henshall hopes his daughter will share. \"Now we have moved up here there will be a lot more scope for getting out in the country for walks,\" he says. \"The bigger she gets Im sure she will love that. I want her to be an outside person.\"Henshall is reticent on what work projects he has in the pipeline. \"There is a couple of interesting things kicking about but I dont want to talk about them because I dont want to curse them,\" he says.What about burning ambitions  \"I would like to work in America. But I am past that overly ambitious phase of my le. I would like to stay as relevant as I possibly can as an actor.\"I want to keep working on things that are going to push me and are intellectually interesting with subject matter that is relevant and exciting. Mainly, I like working with good writers.\"He isnt a man to turn up, deliver his lines, take the pay cheque and go home. Henshall looks pained at the suggestion.\"Och, no. I could have had a much easier leI had decided that is what I wanted to do with my work,\" he says. \"But I never have. I dont really see the point in changing now.\"Shetland begins on BBC One, Tuesday, pmThanks to the Everyman Cinema Glasgow "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9398381.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brexit-voices-why-i-cried-over-eu-referendum-result","story":"Noelia Yusta, , lived in UK for  years\"Following Brexit, I was a bit p*****off about the whole thing.

So when they said were going ahead with Brexit, I elbowed my husband and said: its happening. He looked at me and said, what are you talking about  I said, it is happening, and were out.

I have built a career here, I am responsible for a college library and I am on the board of the professional body for librarians in Scotland . I am not on a permanent contract and I am not even sure that my employer will be able to renew my contractI have to get a VISA.

To tackle the uncertainty I started the process to Brexit-proof myself almost straight away. I applied for a Registration Certicate, Residence Card, and ultimately British Citizenship.\"To be honest, it feels somewhat bittersweet: to have become a British citizen at a time where EU citizens are increasingly made to feel like others.I now feel more secure, although my job prospects are uncertain . I also worry for EU citizens here whose road to settled status or citizenship is more challenging, as well as for British nationalsand their ability to move to the continentthey ever wanted or needed to.\"One final thing I dont fully understand is the governments outward hostility towards EU citizens, such as Theresa Mays lsquoqueue-jumpingrsquo comment.

I do not mean this solely from a personal perspective as a EU citizen, but also from a societal perspective. It is now clear that Brexit is not going to be the idyllic tale they wanted people to believe.\"As I write, the government is stepping up preparations for a no-deal. This eventuality would, without a doubt, present serious and long lasting negative consequences, which will be detrimental for the whole of society both in the short and long term.\"My greatest concern is related to the NHS and its future.

Moreover, for me research is a collective or group experience that has to go across country borders: being exposed to the iety of ersity of cases and situations we have in Europe is a great form of learning. I could not imagine keeping doing research without being exposed to such ersities and to European research networks and communities.\"Personally, for someone like me that deeply believes in Europe and feels as a European citizen, Brexit has brought in a sense of rejection, likethe community that hosted me at some point decided I was not welcome anymore.

And its a trait Carole likes. \"Id never miss a game, home or away,\" he grins from under a hat emblazoned with the Talbot shield. What would have to happen for him not to go and see his team  \"Dead,\" butts in Carole, . George, laughing at himself, admits escaping weddings to watch Auchinleck.:The Junior club which outclasses football giantsTheir semi, on Beechwood Avenue, sits just opposite the Talbot clubhouse. On their gate, in careful metalwork, is another shield, above their door, two flagstaffs.Carole Palmer at her front gate, picture by Colin MearnsBut the Palmers are not the only family to go full black and gold, the Talbot colours. Much of town has. Along its Main Street, the last few shops and pubs have put up flags and bunting. Why Auchinleck, a junior club, has made it in to the fth round of the senior Scottish Cup. After slaying Ayr United, the professional team from its county town  miles away, they are off to Edinburgh, to challenge premiership giants Hearts.This weekend at least  buses will leave the former pit village for the capital. Some  tickets have been sold. That is one for every second resident of the town.George and Carole Palmer and their daughter Karen\"Everybody is hyper,\" says George. \"The town feels great.\"Things are not usually easy in Auchinleck.AuchinleckThe coal mines - the very reason for its existence - are closed, their remnants now post-industrial tourist attractions. The old shops, the Co-Ops butchers and haberdashery stores, went decades ago, replaced, eventually, by a Tesco on the towns edge. Unemployment here in East Ayrshire is twice the national average.Soon the secondary school will shut, to be merged in to a new campus in neighbouring Cumnock. There is no cafe in the town centre open in an afternoon.Auchinleck is losing all of the little focal points that cement a community. Except Talbot. Football binds this place together, winning football, that is.Beechwood ParkTalbot may not play in the big leagues. But that means it is used to success and crowds of what would seem an impossible size for the community. Beechwood Park has a bigger capacity, around , standing, than Auchinleck has a population. George caught the Bot bug from his dad .:The Junior club which outclasses football giantsSo did Iain Wilson. His father, Alec, like oh-so-many men in the village, was a miner, a Communist who was a steward down one of Ayrshires last pits. Iain, , is keeping his head warm with a gringo green military cap, a red star stitched on its front. Family holidays, explains, were bus trips to the other side of the Iron Curtain.Iain WilsonForget the Cold War. In much of western Scotland it was football which ided towns and cities. Not in Auchinleck. Here the game brings people together. On the stands, explains Mr Wilson, politics and religion, is forgotten. So, sometimes are local sporting rivalries.\"My girlfriend Susan is an Ayr fan,\" says Iain. \"She stood in in the Talbot end. She would probably say Talbot is her wee team.Iain, a former health worker, admits he has a big team, Celtic. What would happenAuchinleck played Celtic  Who would he support. \"Talbot, of course,\" he says.This - for Auchinleck folk - is key. The spirit of a mining community - when your colleague always had to have your back, regardless of politics, religion or background - lives on in sport.\"You talk about that Rangers and Celtic thing,\" explains Iain. \"They all used to work together, now they play together and they drink together - there are no Rangers or Celtic pubs - and they watch Talbot together.\"This community pride has rubbed off on the club. \"We dont get the best players because we pay the most money, \"Iain says. \"The players are there because they want to be. They have kept themselves at the top of the game by the way they have been run.\"Success is not new. \"The main thing for this club is the league and the junior cup,\" Iain says. \"Up till this season people were not that enamoured about playing with the big clubs. It took a wee bit away from the junior cup. This season has an amazing run. It has given the club an exposure you cannot buy.\"Iain has his whole route on the \"lang whang\" - the historic A from Ayr to Edinburgh - planned for Sundays match.Rab Cross, picture by Colin MearnsRab Cross, , is all set too. Hes nursing a Tennants at the Market Inn, a Bot scarf round his neck and a Rangers shirt on his back. \"I am a season ticket holder for both clubs,\" he says, making a distinction between senior and junior. Rab, a ed salesman, has been going to see both teams for decades. Talbots glory years, however, came when he was an adult.On the Market Inns wall is a wood plaque with each off the clubs dozen Junior Cup titles. First, , then all the rest since . Below is the legend, The Real Madrid of the Juniors and the curious phrase \"Eeka Peeka Pukka Po\". This, explains Rab, comes from a s deaf fan who could not quite manage to sing \"Well support you ever more.\" Instead of mocking or excluding the supporter, the crowd adopted his version.Behind the bar is landlord John Lyle,  and born and bred in Auchinleck and self-confessed \"Talbot diehard\". In pride of place, among his best spirits, is a little wooden mascot, called Eeka Peeka Pukka Po.Do any of his customers not support the team  He laughs. \"All of the lads are supporters. The club is the backbone of the town. It is all we have. If it wasnt for Talbot, we would not be on the map.\"John Lyle, picture by Colin MearnsTalbot preserves the spirit of a town, says councillorNEIL McGhee is, he says, an \"interlouper\". The now councillor flit to Auchinleck half a century ago. The son of a Prestwick miner, he had come for the dancing. And he stayed for a girl, his now we Jane.As he walks down his \"new\" homes Main Street, the -year-old strokes the sandstone walls of one of its Victorian buildings. \"Its lost its sparkle,\" Neil says. Hes talking about the building material, which would once have shined on a wet day. But he might as well mean the whole town.\"We have a terrible problem with apathy,\" he says. \"People, especially young people have no hope. There are so few jobs. If only they would improve the roads or help bring some industry, some light industry, to the town.\"People talk a lot about austerity. Well, we have had it for  years, ever since the mines closed.\"Neil, in a black Auchinleck Talbot windcheater, is pointing out where there used to be shops in the towns heyday.When most people think of poverty or unemployment, reckons Neil, their minds turn to big cities and towns. And it is big cities and towns, he argues, that get the resources to fight deprivation.: Auchinleck manager urges team to stay focused\"Its hidden around here, the poverty,\" he says. \"Its forgotten. But I really worry about the young people. I worry about their mental health, that some of them give up.\"This is where football comes in.Shops decorated in buntingEverybody Neil passes says hello. The last few businesses on the street have bunting to match his jacket. Austerity aside, the mood in Auchinleck is good.\"The place is buzzing with excitement and expectation of another victory, a surprise victory,\" he says. \"The aspiration for many people is not very high and this game is one of the rare occasions when they get to be enjoy le without the worries of poverty.\"We are looking forward to a wonderful weekend and we will enjoy it regardless of the result.\"Neil McGheeNeil has been going to the football every since he arrived in the town. He has stood with the same friends for  years. He remembers losing a bet on the street when the Bot went down - in the late s.The club was not thriving when coal was. In fact, its biggest spells of success only came after the  strike that was the beginning of the end for Scottish mining.The secret of Talbots rise  Good management at a club run by its fans, reckons Neil. \"We are a small community and we are grateful to the committee for the long, long history they have of victory in junior cups and the west of Scotland league,\" he says. They are key to keeping the spirit of the village alive and we cant praise them highly enough because they work non-stop and very hard.\"Beechwoord Park, by Colin Mearns"},{"url":null,"title":"digital-copyright-reforms-move-a-step-further-after-approval-of-text","story":"The Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Unionconcluded discussions on Friday evening on new compromise proposals, which will be put to MEPs next week before they make their final decision at a later date.UPDATES on # directive: Romanian Presidency to continue negotiations w  @Europarl_EN based on the mandate in @EUCouncil #COREPER meeting. #ROEUmdash ROEUFebruary , Two parts of the law, Article  and Article , have been most contentious since the start of talks to changerules, which could affect the way music, memes and news articles are shared online.Some creators argue Article  of the law protects their work, while critics fear it will ruin the internet.ldquoGlad to see EU countries once again finding a common voice onreform, said Andrus Ansip, European Commission vice-president for the digital single market following the announcement.ldquoEuropeans deserverules fit for digital age: it is good for creators, s and for regular internet us.Council has approved themandate: Now wersquore going to have to stop #Article in Parliament!

area because some patients may have been admitted to hospital for an unrelated issue.It is also possible that there are ldquosignicant numbers of patients with FGM who have not been admitted to hospital, the board said.The figures were revealed after the UNrsquos International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM was marked on Wednesday.And at the start of February, the mother of a three-year-old girl became the first to be found guilty of FGM in the UK.The Ugandan woman, , from east London, was found guilty of cutting her daughter after a trial at the Old Bailey.East Dunbartonshire MP Ms Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: ldquoThese figures show that NHS professionals across Scotland are recording treating women who have experienced FGM.ldquoIt is a barbaric and traumatic practice that must be completely eradicated. Nobody should be in any doubt that it is child abuse and it is against the law.ldquoThe Scottish and UK governments, police and other services must work closely to protect women and girls from FGM. They must also ensure that there are sufficient resources for training and support services to help women and girls who are victims of FGM to deal with the physical and psychological consequences.ldquoWe waited a long time to see the first conviction in the UK for female genital mutilation.

We need to ask the right questions in a straightforward and sensitive way to establish the understanding and relationship needed to ensure that the girl or woman, and her family members, are given the care, protection and safeguarding they need.An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: ldquoWe have no confirmation that FGM is being practised in Scotland, however there is intelligence that cutting does happen where in the UK.ldquoThere is a clinic at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, run by the SNIPS team , which sees all women who have disclosed FGM.ldquoFor the most part, they do not need any treatment and will more than likely go on to have a normal birth.ldquoA small number of women are referred to the gynaecological services.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise north east nursery","story":"Education inspectors have expressed confidence in the ongoing improvements being made at Rothienorman Pre-School Nursery.A recent visit led to the village hall facility being described as a “welcome and nurturing environment” and Inspectors said children were “happy, enthusiastic, and developing confidence”.Key strengths included a “dedicated team” which inspectors said have developed positive relationships and a “strong sense of community”.But the nursery has been asked to improve in certain areas, including increased use of national guidance to develop a “robust and rigorous approach to self-evaluation”. Inspectors said this will enable practitioners to identy what is working well and what needs to improve.They also want to see development of approaches to assessment and planning to help improve the quality of learning experiences and provide “greater depth and challenge” for all children.Improvements are also being sought in the development of practitioners’ knowledge and understanding of how to support children’s early language and mathematical thinking.Inspectors are confident that the setting has the capacity to continue to improve and will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

Mrs Grant was promised an update in two months.Sunday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04094000/04094553.jpg","title":"Plans to tackle Wick town centre parking hailed as very good news","story":"Local Highland councillor Andrew Sinclair said he welcomed the proposals outlined in a traffic order as they give the local authority greater powers to deal with what has been a contentious issue for many years.Many other areas of Wick would also be subject to restrictions.Councillor Sinclair, who represents the Wick and East Caithness ward, said: \"I think this is very good news for the town. We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Sunday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

Following the receipt of the necessary permissions from statutory authorities late last week, work to undertake a sectional cable replacement is now under way.#The statement added: #It is expected this work, which will be contingent on tidal flows and weather conditions, will be complete early next week, with the line re-energised shortly after.“As part of SSEN’s subsea cable inspection and replacement programme, a project to progress an end-to-end replacement of the Pentland Firth East distribution cable is already at an advanced stage of development, with cable installation and commissioning currently due to take place in autumn next year.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers. People who live and work locally, who can make themselves available to respond and who meet our other requirements.”If you are interested in finding out more about the Braid Valley Community First Responder Scheme, the scheme organisers, NIAS and Dalriada Urgent Care are hosting an open evening at  pm on Wednesday February  at:NIAS North Division HQ –  Antrim RoadBallymena.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful.

But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion.

Northern Ireland should stand as a reminder to the Taoiseach of how we have overcome many greater obstacles in the past,\" she said.Mr Varadkar said everybody wanted to avoid a no-deal and a hard border and \"to continue to have a very close political and economic relationship between Britain and Ireland no matter want happens\".He said: \"There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short, and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible, and Ill be working very hard and redoubling my efforts, along with government, to do that.\"He insisted that while the backstop was not up for renegotiation, \"we can talk about the joint political declaration and what changes might be made to that and what assurances may be given that would assist this agreement being ratied\".Asked about the controversial comment of European Council president Donald Tusk that there was a \"special place in Hell\" for Brexiteers without a plan, Mr Varadkar pointed to anti-EU political rhetoric.\"It was only a few months ago that people in the UK Government were comparing the European Union to communism and bear in mind President Tusk spent much of his le fighting to overthrow communism,\" he said.\"So I think there has been a lot of rhetoric coming from a lot of dferent quarters and I think the best thing to do is just to rise above it.\"The DUP leader said it was important for Mr Varadkar to understand that unionist views on the backstop could not be ignored.\"The EU must respect that, for unionists, a new border east-west is no more acceptable than a new border north-south,\" she said. \"The draft withdrawal agreement was unacceptable because it would cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK and create a democratic deficit in Belfast.\"We will test any new draft withdrawal agreement against its impact on the Union and whether it respects the referendum result.\"She declined to be drawn on whether alternative proposals to the backstop had been discussed during the meeting. The DUP leader said she wasnt enthusiastic about extending Article a Brexit deal wasnt reached by March .\"What we are focused on is trying to find a deal. That is where everybody should be focused, and not focused on extending the time further,\" she said.\"Because I think, as you know, here in Northern Irelandyou give more time often you dont get the outcome.\"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who also attended the meeting, said he believed a Westminster majority for a Brexit deal could be found with his partys MPs and some Labour rebels voting with the Tories.Speaking after her meeting with Mr Varadkar, Sinn Feins vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"I think the Taoiseach has remained firm throughout the negotiation in recognising the need to protect Irish interests, in recognising the need to make sure that citizens in the North are never left behind.\"He restated that commitment to us today. At the end of the day we will hold the Taoiseachs feet to the fire on the issue.\"She added: \"Any retreat from it would jeopardise Irish interests, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. With the exception of the unionist parties, there is political unanimity north and south on the need to protect the backstop.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said there must be \"realism\" in Dublin about unionists backstop concerns.\"The dismissal of these concerns will inevitably have long lasting consequences for relationships north and south of the border,\" he said.\"Equating opposition to the backstop as beckoning theof violence is an extremely dangerous and foolhardy position for the Republic of Irelands Government to take.\"It is providing justication in advance for those who may attempt to turn the clock back.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party had a positive meeting with the Taoiseach and said it was reassuring that he had reiterated his support for the backstop.Last nights one-on-one between Mr Varadkar and Mrs May came at the request of the British Government at the end of a week when she has travelled to Belfast and Brussels.Her team was warned in advance by Irish officials that while they were happy to host her, any Brexit discussions could only be interpreted as \"talk\".They stressed Ireland negotiates its position through the European Unoin taskforce led by Michel Barnier.Mr Varadkar said the meeting was an opportunity \"to share our perspectives and for us to listen to each other\".\"There is much more that unites us than ides us and time is running short,\" he said.The Prime Minister is believed to have used the meeting to explain her desire for legally binding changes to the Brexit deal.This has been repeatedly ruled out by Mr Varadkar and key EU leaders.How you voted in our online pollAn online Belfastpoll has found that readers are narrowly against the Brexit backstop.Our unscientic Facebook poll asked readers to vote for or against the proposal in the Withdrawal Agreement.Over , people have taken part in the vote, with % saying they were against the backstop and % voting in favour of keeping it.The controversial backstop proposal is intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.It has become a major sticking point of the Brexit negotiations, with hardline Conservatives and the DUP opposing the plan, which led to the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May in the House of Commons last month.The DUP has said that it believes the backstop plan would create a trade border in the Irish Sea and could leave Northern Ireland tied to the EU indefinitely.It would only come into effecta trade deal is not reached between the EU and UK during the -month Brexit transition period.Under the plan the UK would effectively remain inside the EU’s customs union, with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market until a deal is reached.The Irish Government and EU have remained steadfast in their view that the backstop is the best way of preventing a hard border in Ireland.MPs voted to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements”, with Prime Minister Theresa May ing to Brussels on Thursday in an attempt to renegotiate her deal.Mrs May described discussions with EU leaders as “robust but constructive” and insisted she was determined to “negotiate hard” over the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn option of second referendum remains open if brexit deal rejected","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a second Commons showdown on her Brexit deal by the end of the month..pushShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour will use a Commons amendment to require the Prime Minister to hold another “meaningful vote” on her deal by February .The move is in response to fears that Mrs May is engaged in a “cynical” attempt to run down the clock before the March  Brexit date in order to leave MPs with a stark choice of accepting her deal or crashing out of the European Union without any agreement.If no deal on the changes to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has been reached with Brussels by Wednesday, as seems overwhelmingly likely, Mrs May will address MPs on progress made, say more time is needed for negotiations, and table a “neutral motion” for debate the following day.Sir Keir’s new deadline is expected to be one of a range of amendments tabled for votes on Valentine’s Day.The PM is promising another “meaningful vote” in the coming weeks but Labour will seek to take the decision out of her hands.“We have got to put a hard stop into this running down the clock,” Sir Keir told the Sunday Times. “And that’s what we want to do this week.”He believes the Prime Minister is “pretending to make progress” but actually intends toto Parliament after the March   European Council summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a “binary choice” – her deal or no deal.“We can’t allow that to happen,” Sir Keir said. “There needs to be a day when Parliament says that’s it, enough is enough.”In the interview Sir Keir described Mrs May’s approach as “reckless” and “blinkered” and blamed her “tunnel vision” for the devastating defeat suffered  last month when MPs threw out her Brexit deal by a record  votes.“It’s this blinkered approach that’s got us to where we are, with her never wanting to see where the real majority is in Parliament,” Sir Keir said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has written to the Prime Minister setting out his demands for a Brexit deal he could support, accused Mrs May of an “utterly cynical” approach.In a speech in Coventry he said Labour’s plan “could win the support of Parliament and bring the country together” but Mrs May has so far “chosen the path of ision”.“If she is unable to adopt a sensible deal because it would split the Tories, then the answer is quite simple: there must be a general election,” Mr Corbyn said.The Prime Minister survived a confidence motion in her government tabled by Mr Corbyn, which could have led to an election, after her Brexit deal was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs in January.Mr Corbyn said that without an election “we will keep all options on the table – as agreed in our conference motion – including the option of a public vote”.In his letter to Mrs May, the Labour leader set out five demands, including a permanent customs union and close alignment with the single market.The move led to a backlash from pro-EU Labour MPs, but Sir Keir defended the approach and warned against a split in the party.“When you go through something like Brexit, it is very important that you keep the opposition strong and united,” he said.“We have to keep it together, because in the end, any chance of effective opposition goesan opposition party starts to lose members from their team.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say february","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this. I would like to reassure everyone that the samples that were reviewed were a small percentage of those screened and reported between April  and June .“The stringent quality checks that are in place have reassured us that it was only a certain number of tests within this timeframe that were required to be re-examined.” ‘Le-saving’Sinn Féin Councillor Caoimhe McKnight has said her party has requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust.The Derry councillor recently encouraged local women to have regular Smear Tests as she reflected on her own experience with the “le-saving” procedure.Cllr. McKnight said: “I can speak from experience when I say that a Smear Test could literally save your le.  When living in Scotland at the age of , which is the age there at which you are eligible for a smear, I received the notication of my eligibility and advised to avail of it.“But like many young women I put it off for a couple of months before finally going for the test.  When I tell you how grateful I am that I made the decision to have the test it is no exaggeration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It was luckythat I made the decision to have the test as they found abnormal cells.  I dread to think what I may have been toldI had to wait until the age of  before being tested.“After treatment and a few yearly smears everything is now fine and I am now in the normal  year test cycle.”She said it will be a “distressing” time for the women recalled but urged them all to contact their GPs to schedule a repeat smear test as soon as possible.\"While the Western Trust have said that this is a precautionary measure it will still cause concern and worry so it is important the affected women do not face undue delay in receiving a repeat test.\"In June ,  women in Belfast and Newtownabbey were also invited to attend for repeat smear test after the Public Health Agency were made aware of concerns identied in April that year.\"As I understand it, the Western Trust’s review of cervical smear tests concerned those in April and June , but it is not clearthere is a connection with what happened in Belfast and Newtownabbey in June and this recent action by the Western Trust.\"Sinn Féin have requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust and we will be raising these concerns directly with them,\" she added.‘Mistakes’Meanwhile, SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins told women to call the Western Trust helpline, to allay any concerns.Cllr Dobbins commented: “This is not the first time mistakes have been made in regards to cervical screening laboratories lessons should and must be learnt from issues both in the South and in England.“Undoubtedly this recall will be a cause of concern for many women. However, I must stress the fact that only a fraction of those tested between April to June  were affected and will receive letters this week to arrange a repeat test with their GP.“This does not necessarily indicate that initial results were incorrect, rather the recall is a precautionary measure intended to allay concerns.”The Western Trust has advised the affected women thatthey have any concerns or want further information, they should contact the Western Trust’s Laboratory Department on   , from Tuesday  February to Wednesday  February between am to

chief executive Liam Hannaway reflected upon the organisationrsquos work over the past year during the annual rates meeting.He said the organisation continued to deliver on both the services and key projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under

of the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17389358.launch-of-new-community-led-project-exploring-local-heritage-from-mountain-top-to-lough-shore/resources/images/9394735.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

They are a critical organisation in the electricity sector here. It would be dficult to convey the importance of the job that our members do. “Put simply, things won’t work without them. In light of that, the decision to ballot for industrial action is one that has not been taken lightly.”Outlining workers’ concerns, she continued: “Each year, there is a negotiation for a cost-of-living pay award. Since  there hasn’t been one. There are pay claims which are three years in dispute, going into a fourth year. You can see by theof time this has been going on that this is not a reckless act, it is with absolute reluctance that our members are being faced with this decision.”She added: “We are aware of concerns from members about the independence of SONI, its relationship with EirGrid and EirGrid’s relationship with the Irish government. As far as we are concerned, we are negotiating with SONI. We are not negotiating with EirGrid. The bottom line for us is pay, or the lack of pay for more than three years.”‘Urgent’ need to get N S interconnector built Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A spokesperson for SONI said: “We are disappointed that SONI staff, who are members of the Prospect Union, are actively proceeding with a formal ballot for industrial action in relation to a pay claim.“SONI has already offered independent arbitration through the Labour Relations Agency to resolve the pay claim however this has been rejected by the union.”Robin McCormick, General Manager at SONI said: “We have been engaging with staff and representatives from the Prospect Union over several months in an attempt to reach a resolution to this matter, however, to date, we have been unable to reach a satisfactory outcome.“The company is continuing to engage with staff and their representatives through the offices of the Labour Relations Agency to resolve the matter.“In addition, the offer of Industrial Arbitration remains on the table, as we believe it to be the best route to a satisfactory outcome for our staff, the organisation and our customers throughout Northern Ireland.”UUP MLA Roy Beggs, asked about the potential impact of industrial action, said: “SONI is an essential piece of the Northern Ireland electricity infrastructure. Without SONI co-ordinating the dispatch of electricity from our power stations, we risk blackouts.“SONI staff have a high level of technical expertise and three-to-four years is an exceptionally long time to go without even an inflationary pay increase. I hope that Northern Ireland is not getting caught up in industrial disputes which are occurring in the Republic as a result of the Irish government’s stance on public sector pay.”try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian OgleIan Ogle funeral: He died protecting those he believed to be in danger, pastor tells mourners          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Nobody should be in any doubt that it is child abuse and it is against the law.ldquoThe Scottish and UK governments, police and other services must work closely to protect women and girls from FGM. They must also ensure that there are sufficient resources for training and support services to help women and girls who are victims of FGM to deal with the physical and psychological consequences.ldquoWe waited a long time to see the first conviction in the UK for female genital mutilation. It should pave the way for further concerted action.Dr Duncan McCormick, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Lothian, said: ldquoWe are very clear in our commitment to and responsibility for identying and treating children and women at high risk of FGM in Lothian.ldquoIt is a form of abuse and gender based violence that has serious short and long term physical and psychological consequences, andany health professional has concerns they have a responsibility to share that information to safeguard the wellbeing of women and children.ldquoFGM is a hugely complex and sensitive issue that requires health professionals to approach the subject carefully. We need to ask the right questions in a straightforward and sensitive way to establish the understanding and relationship needed to ensure that the girl or woman, and her family members, are given the care, protection and safeguarding they need.An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: ldquoWe have no confirmation that FGM is being practised in Scotland, however there is intelligence that cutting does happen where in the UK.ldquoThere is a clinic at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, run by the SNIPS team , which sees all women who have disclosed FGM.ldquoFor the most part, they do not need any treatment and will more than likely go on to have a normal birth.ldquoA small number of women are referred to the gynaecological services.

Mark, who is a double kidney transplant recipient, first received a transplant back in  but in January  that transplanted kidney sadly began to shut down.The programme chronicles how mum Jo-Anne, now Northern Ireland Ambassador for national kidney patient charity Kidney Care UK, put herself forward to donate her kidney through the renal unit at the Belfast City Hospital. Commenting on taking part in the BBC documentary Jo-Anne said: “Last March Mark and I literally placed our lives in the hands of heroes! The renal unit and it’s amazing staff hold a very special place in our hearts and we were absolutely thrilled to be part of this important documentary which has the power to inspire and to save lives through promoting the organ donation message. “The cameras followed us on our visits to the renal and transplant units at the City Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital, as well as attending a very emotional organ donation service in Botanic Gardens and, at home and on our family farm.“Looking back it doesn’t seem anything like a year since we had our surgery and to see Mark looking so well makes it all worth while!It’s hugely important to us to continue to promote a message of hope and that’s why teaming up with Stephen Watson in this way to share our story and to let people see behind-the-scenes of our transplant journey means so much to us. Mark is one of the lucky ones because sadly not everyone has the opportunity to receive that gt of le through organ donation and this vital message is very much highlighted within the program. “Being a part of this BBC documentary was very important for both Mark and myself.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed. House of Fraser has said it has “agreed terms with Commerz Real to secure a new long-term lease” with Victoria Square. Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley bought the retailer out of administration for £m, and has earmarked some of the House of Fraser stores for closure. House of Fraser now says it is “committed to fully renovating the store with investment upwards of £m. Design agencies have been appointed, with works due to start in mid-”. It says the deal secures “the futures of over  members of staff in Belfast”. Katharina von Schacky, global head of shopping at Commerz Real, said: “We worked very closely with House of Fraser to secure the new long-term lease in the city centre. “This will further strengthen Belfast and it shows the unique position Victoria Square has in the Belfast region.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.
