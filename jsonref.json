It has been stuck for seven months below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.Employment in the sector fell for the eighth month in a row and the pace of job losses was the steepest since September 2012 as manufacturers sought to reduce their costs.Factories cut their output at a faster rate than previously as they ran down stocks they had built up before the 31 October Brexit deadline.New orders fell for the seventh consecutive month, reflecting tougher conditions in the UK and overseas. The drop in new export orders was among the steepest of the past seven years.Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: “November saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election.“Destocking at manufacturers and their clients following the latest Brexit delay was a major contributor to the weakness experienced by the sector. Inflationary pressures meanwhile showed signs of moderating further, with input costs falling slightly for the first time since March 2016.” This was linked to lower global commodity prices and exchange rate effects.Lee Collinson, the head of manufacturing at Barclays, said: “With any new year comes renewed hope, but the certainty the sector longs for needs to come pretty sharpish in 2020 to help bolster the performance of UK manufacturing.”In the eurozone, manufacturing activity declined for the 10th month in a row, although there were some signs of improvement. A Markit survey for the eurozone showed the PMI rose to 46.9 in November from October’s 45.9, signalling a slower rate of decline.Germany’s contraction eased but its export-reliant factory sector remained bottom of the table, followed by Austria, Spain and Italy. Only Greece and France recorded an expansion in their manufacturing industries.China’s manufacturers fared better than the UK and the eurozone last month, with new export orders posting the first back-to-back monthly rise for more than a year-and-a-half. The CaixinMarkit China manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in November from 51.7, suggesting the impact of the US-China trade war may be easing. Staffing levels at Chinese factories were stable following seven months of decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3fd91b92510559102bb7e01f73d10370d8cfddf/606_0_1832_1100/master/1832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61fe25155c9119b2f7e26b5d42cef2c","title":"sky jobs elstree tv film studio","story":"Hollywood-style complex, which will have 14 sound stages, is due to open in 2022Sky is to build a Hollywood-style film studio in north London, creating more than 2,000 new jobs, as the pay-TV company ramps up its fight against streaming giants Netflix and Amazon.The 13 hectare (32 acre) studio complex is being built in Elstree, just down the road from Elstree Studios where rival Netflix shoots flagship series The Crown, and will open in 2022.Sky Studios Elstree will become the European production base for Sky and NBCUniversal, which owns Fast and the Furious maker Universal Studios, as both are owned by US pay-TV giant Comcast.“Sky Studios will play a pivotal role in bringing the wealth of UK and European talent and creativity to the world,” said the Sky group chief executive, Jeremy Darroch. “We share a joint vision to create a world-leading production capability that will support the creation of thousands of jobs in the creative sector.”The company has made the move to develop its own production base as the UK increasingly faces a squeeze on studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants pour billions into making content.More than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows were made in the UK last year with a total production spend of more than £3bn.Sky spends about £7bn annually on programming, from Premier League rights to buying shows such as Game of Thrones and original productions such as Chernobyl and Fortitude. Sky as said that it intends to double the amount it spends on making its own shows to about £1bn a year over the next five years.Sky Studios Elstree will have 14 stages, the smallest of which be 1,800 sq metres, which will be enough space to shoot several films and TV shows at the same time. It will be about a third bigger than the plans to build a Hollywood-style studio complex in Dagenham East, which have stalled after the developer put its plans on hold.Earlier this year Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns. Netflix is spending about $500m (£385m) on making show and films in the UK this year.

I had no idea what my face and skin would do. Most women glimpse that future in their mother’s face. But my mum died when she was 40, so I never saw her face – our face – age. What I did see, though, was my mum, twice a day, stand in front of the bathroom mirror and place a dot of white cream on her forehead, on her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks, and one dollop on the tip of my nose and rub the moisturiser in. Another guiding light came in the form of Jackie magazine. It instructed me on the twice-a-day cleanse, tone and moisturise routine, and it’s the only religion I’ve ever had. Since those days, I’ve gained the deepest lines around my eyes when I laugh. But that means I’ve laughed. My once-teenage smattering of cheek freckles has taken over my entire visage too. But that means the sun has kissed me over and over, the insatiable thing.I’m 53, and my face finally makes sense. Is it bad to say I sort of like my face? Sort of like it very much? Not that it’s perfect, of course mine is a nose only a parent could love (and not necessarily unconditionally). But I really do like it. And more so as I get older. I think my face is sort of beautiful. Not because the features are beautiful – don’t make me mention my jowls – but because there’s a beauty in ageing. We all know about the glow of youth, of course, but there’s an easy, radiating warmth in maturity that’s unmissable, too.Accepting how you look, letting go of the angst at last, breathing out and allowing your face to relax into itself is incredibly attractive. Oh, I was so uncomfortable in my younger skin. I thought myself ugly. I’d hide my nose with my hand when talking to people. I’d try to cover those freckles up with foundation and my face would look like a giant digestive and I truly put the trauma in T-zone by refusing to leave the flat if I had a spot. Thank God for my oily skin now, though, it’s given me fewer wrinkles than I deserve.Who would ever think they’d be happier in their skin in their 50s? Not me. But here I am, with a new love of online makeup tutorials and excitedly awaiting the delivery of my new chocolate brown eyeliner. (At 53 I’ve learned black is too harsh for me.)Beauty doesn’t end in mid-life. Nor does it end in your 60s, your 70s, or your 80s. It blossoms in new and unimagined ways. You’re kind to your skin and, most importantly, you’re kind to yourself. No, you don’t look the same as you did in your 30s. Good! I was miserable with how I looked in my 30s.

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

Sunshine (yes, that is her real name), an interiors specialist and journalist, has carved an illustrious 21-year career working across the world’s most prestigious publications. A busy freelancer, she’s used to juggling multiple people, projects and workplaces but the role that’s newest to her is motherhood …On motherhood: ‘I now really understand the juggle’“I had my daughter when I was 40, so I was quite an old parent,” says Sunshine.“I always hoped that someday I would have a child, and for me it’s the best thing in the world. I feel incredibly lucky and happy, but as someone who had their first child relatively late in life, I now really understand the juggle.”While she wouldn’t change a thing, Sunshine thinks it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. “I was part of the generation of women who were told they could have it all but it really is harder than I anticipated, I have to be honest.”On friendship: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling that someone has your back’Friendships at 40 are more important than ever, says Sunshine – even if she has less time to spend on them. “I’ve known my best friend since I was 11,” she says. “For all intents and purposes, we’re sisters.“We don’t get much face-to-face time – but I can still text her and say: ‘My kid is struggling I’m finding it really difficult’ and she’ll phone me immediately and say: ‘Right, I’ve got 10 minutes before work, but please don’t worry, this happens, this is how we dealt with it …’”“That means everything,” she says. “It’s a wonderful feeling that someone has your back.”On work: ‘I haven’t got a plan’In her career, however, Sunshine strives to keep out of her comfort zone. She started on The ’s fashion desk in 1997.“It was cool Britannia, New Labour was in full swing – of course the old Tory boys there weren’t liking it,” she laughs. “For someone learning things on a newspaper, there was so much going on: the death of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace – it was an interesting time.”But the fashion world wasn’t for her. “I’m still haunted by fashion shows,” she says. So she “fell” into interior design journalism 15 years ago.“I was totally out of my depth when I stumbled into it,” says Sunshine. “But found it so thrilling and fascinating. I asked a million stupid questions that I genuinely wanted to know the answers to, and I haven’t stopped learning. I’m always slightly out of my depth, and that’s great.”It’s an attitude that underpins her career. “I haven’t got a plan,” she says. “I believe in being proactive – and in good luck, bad luck and happy accidents along the way.”On beauty: ‘You can be really smart and enjoy moisturiser and lipstick’When it comes to ageing, she’s equally laid back. “It’s fascinating watching my skin age,” Sunshine says. “I’m OK with it. I think it’s ageing well.”But while she may be laid back about the ageing process, Sunshine strikes a more serious note when it comes to her relationship with the beauty world. “I get annoyed that women are accused of not being serious or intelligent if they have an interest in beauty and fashion,” she says. “They aren’t mutually exclusive you can be really smart and enjoy moisturiser and lipstick. And never listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.”On happiness: ‘I feel lucky every day’This same self-assurance is something she’d have liked her younger self to have had more of. “I wish I had been less fearful of things in my 20s,” she says. “That I was braver – I wish I’d had more confidence.”“I love what I do. And the active choice I made to have a child. I am thrilled, I feel lucky every day, but I’m not going to make out that it’s all perfect, because it’s not.”Beauty is ageless.

But there’s still hope that a Conservative takeover can be blockedWhat is all too possible is a blue wave sweeping all before it to wipe out all that tactical nuancing of each seat. In that instant our Brexit doom will be sealed and Boris Johnson will be off the leash – with the BBC, NHS, and safety, food and work regulations all in peril. As his party’s manifesto suggests, we will be out of the European convention on human rights, and he will be free to do anything that takes his populist fancy (alone with Belarus, no place for minorities or journalists). Whether throwing away keys, reintroducing capital punishment, banishing foreigners, stamping on “scroungers’’ or cracking down on Gypsies and Travellers, now that he’s replaced Tory liberal lawyers with cohorts of Priti Patel, he will be able to use any means to bind his ex-Labour Brexit seats to Torydom.That’s the nightmare: Britain joining the rightwing authoritarians to break Europe’s civilised democratic values. Johnson has discovered that truth and rules are for little people. He finds there is no authority to stop his rule by yobs with posh accents, if only they can grab those Labour votes. Look at that peevish threat to “review” Channel 4’s licence for empty-chairing him.There’s only one alternative – but it’s a good one. This deeply ided country needs a parliament to reflect itself and block the blue menace. The only balm is a parliament of compromise that blends progressive manifestos and sends the Brexit decision back to the voters, because nothing else can settle it.Here’s another certainty: a majority will not have voted for Johnson. An even bigger majority will not have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. Call it what they like – a confidence and supply agreement, a vote by vote pact – but Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party, Greens and Plaid Cymru together have the makings of a very good government. Never mind the nominal leader: its priorities, taxing and spending would be set together as all are agreed on ending austerity electoral reform would be the glue.Can Labour stop a blue victory? We who travel about asking at bus queues, pubs and school gates, or knocking on doors, glean little more than those perusing unreliable polls. You sniff the air and hope to catch prevailing breezes. You hear pain, irritation with politics and ever more uncertainty. Sharp vignettes illuminate family lives framed in doorways. And some dottiness makes your head spin.In Ossett, Creagh’s most Brexit-supporting ward, she talks of austerity – 11 Sure Start centres lost, £69m school cuts, food banks, a homeless man found dead last week. But there’s a “Fuck off!” from a man in paint-splashed overalls. “I’m for Farage,” he says, “for sending back immigrants. You’ve got a clown for a leader.” Creagh usually tells Corbyn doubters, “You might not like the manager but you still back the team.” That’s no use here.A mother murmurs, yes, she’s Labour. Her autistic son can’t leave the house, four years out of school but he can only find three hours a week tutoring. “Sure Start was great when he was little,” she says. “I’m sorry it went. I’m for remain, I’m really worried what Brexit will do.” Will her husband vote Labour? She looks nervous and whispers, “You’ll have to ask. We don’t talk about it. I don’t know.” Inside, he says brusquely: “I was Labour, but no more. I’m for Farage, got his feet on the ground. We voted out, so it’s out!”Many do greet Creagh warmly: firm Labour supporters, talking of cuts and remembering the time she got their personal independence payments (Pip) restored, the bedroom tax sorted, a universal credit payment challenged or the books she got for an empty school library. But there’s that other wild card: one mum outside the school gates stomps past, hissing, “I’m voting Corbyn, not for you, Blairite!”, a sign of another upcoming battle.Here’s Brenda Trenam to cheer the day with her home full of animals and birds. She voted leave but regrets it now. “Changed my mind, I never expected disruption,” she says. “It’s bad for our children’s future and for food prices. Labour? We always are.” She’s a housekeeper for a cystic fibrosis ward. “I see the nurses’ stress getting worse. I should be retired, but they took away my pension. Will Labour really give it back?” But she’s stunned when her husband Leslie says, “I’m uncertain. I’m Brexit and Boris says he’ll get us out. I’ve been Tory a few years.” “Oh no he hasn’t!” Brenda says, outraged.Lisa Dodd is another leave regretter. “We use the NHS a lot, my husband broke his neck, I had cancer, my mum was sick, so that £350m on the bus for the NHS swayed me. Now I worry what Brexit will do for our children and I want to vote again.” She’s out posting Labour leaflets. But what do you say to the mother who tells me her whole family is moving to Spain unless they get Brexit? Or to a nurse wasting a vote here on no-hope Lib Dems?Out of all that, the thwack of firm government forcing a non-consensual Brexit, with only minority support, would break politics as we know it. Roll on a progressive concordance of the reasonable that would let voters fix the Brexit mess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eabf092a102b30670ab0f52a74fbb2b735686e2/2_0_1540_924/master/1540.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0afe6391d353278df7944f4bb4bbc968","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of frozen","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘frozen’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘frozen’.Share your photos of what frozen means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 December at 10am.

It was summer, always a slow time for TV, so I thought: “Why not?” The remit was that we would talk about anything and everything from a female point of view, but it didn’t have to be limited to women’s issues.I knew early that we were on to something good. Loose Women is unlike anything else on TV. The View, an American talk show, predates it, but that’s quite political. The British take was to add humour. Over the years, various producers have come in with different ideas. Some have worked, some haven’t, and we’ve changed the set and the colourings a million times, but the absolute essence hasn’t changed. There is no point in trying to add bells and whistles. We agreed it should follow the normal pattern of female conversation. When we ladies are out for lunch, we go from uproarious laughter to something topical to something bit teary. So we mimic that in the show. We switch from serious topics to emotional ones, to some sort of public debate, like: “Do you iron your knickers?”We did a month initially, and the viewing figures were good and we all thought it had potential, so when it was commissioned for a further 12-week run we hoped we were onto something. But it was only ever recommissioned in short bursts. We’d have a fantastic wrap party: “Isn’t it amazing?” “Aren’t we brilliant?” “Ha ha ha,” “We love each other,” “See ya.” Then we’d have to wait weeks and weeks for a call. Nadia and I co-presented from 1999 until 2002 when she left to have her first daughter. At one point we lived together too, like Eric and Ernie. Nadia would roll in at three o’clock in the morning, blind drunk, and I’d have fallen asleep after Question Time.We are called Loose Women because the format is loose. It’s how women talk. One minute we’re roaring with laughter, the next we’re crying with misery. I’d come from this hippy, gin-swilling, actressy background, and back in summer 1999 I’d just come out of EastEnders, playing a gangster character called Annie Palmer, when I was asked to film the pilot. I was in makeup, flicking through OK! magazine, chatting about Victoria Beckham, not realising I was talking to the show’s editor. She later told me she’d decided I’d got the part there and then.Jane Moore had a similar “interview”. At the pilot, they asked her to look into the camera and say: “Hello, I’m a Loose Woman.” She said no. That’s when the editor decided to offer Jane the job as a presenter.I’ll never forget meeting Kaye. She had a great big newspaper, I believe it was the , and she kept shaking it, as if to show me she reads the big newspapers. All the women seemed highbrow and posh and I didn’t understand why they needed me. Then I realised: opposites was actually what they needed. It was all about getting different types of women: four sassy, smart, witty, women who can talk the hind legs off a donkey.We only have celebrity guests on if they bring something to the show. Whoopi Goldberg was charming and loved me because I’d been on EastEnders – I couldn’t believe she watched it! In the early days a man wouldn’t come anywhere near the set, but now we have two Loose Men on the panel and we’ve had Gok Wan and Freddie Flintoff on talking about their mental health, which would only happen on a women’s show.I used to say to Kaye: “It won’t have legs for long, this. What are we going to talk about?” And she said: “Don’t be ridiculous. Think of a friendship that lasts for decades. The conversation goes on and on.” We’ve now been doing it for 20 years, and the 3,000th episode aired in May. We had a scream when we lived together. We were never stuck for something to say, even though I was the party girl and she wore the tweedy knickers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df40f9cc1d5e2016f94816276dc0f2300fc839d/25_672_3709_2225/master/3709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69537526a2805ff3f6afeaad1a0fc5a9","title":"british schoolchildren among least satisfied with their lives says oecd report","story":"Influential survey reveals UK 15-year-olds reported biggest declines in life satisfactionSchoolchildren in Britain are more likely to be miserable and less likely to think that their lives have meaning compared with children in other countries, according to an influential OECD survey that shows a slight improvement in the UK’s international education performance.The OECD’s programme for international student assessment (Pisa), which quizzes 15-year-olds on reading, maths, science and a range of attitudes, found that those in the UK had the biggest declines in life satisfaction since its last survey in 2015, with barely half reporting that they were satisfied with their lives.The triennial Pisa findings come amid a largely positive set of test results for the UK, with improvements in Wales and England boosting their international rankings alongside more mixed results for Scotland and Northern Ireland.Dr Angela Donkin, the chief social scientist for the National Foundation for Educational Research, which conducted the Pisa study in the UK, said: “The fact that we have seen the largest fall in life attitudes for all countries should be a wakeup call.“This isn’t just down to the education sector alone to solve, but for the sector to be able to help we need to ensure that mental health provision is properly funded.”The OECD tested children in 79 countries, and found that British 15-year-olds ranked 69th out of 72 countries in the world for life satisfaction, with boys in particular among the least satisfied with their lives.One cause may be that British children ranked next to last among those agreeing that “my life has a clear meaning or purpose”, while the UK was alone in Europe in having more than half of its children reporting that they regularly felt sad. More than one in four British pupils reported being bullied “at least a few times a month”, higher than the OECD average.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the UK’s performance was “tarnished by the worryingly high percentages of miserable and worried pupils” that Pisa has revealed.“These Pisa results will almost certainly be weaponised by the various political parties in order to defend or attack each other’s policies. We’d urge all parties to refrain from this and instead consider the children at the heart of these statistics and the dedicated professionals behind them,” Whiteman said.Overall, the academic results were dominated by the east Asian powerhouses, with mainland China’s entry – comprising pupils from the regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang – outperforming by a large margin the other 78 countries in maths and science.China’s rise relegated Singapore, which topped the rankings in 2015, to second place in all three subjects, although in reading alone Singapore’s scores were indistinguishable from those of China. Macao followed close behind, while Estonia was Europe’s standout performer, supplanting Finland as the highest-performing OECD member.In Pisa’s core tests, Wales was the only UK nation to improve in each of its scores in reading, maths and science compared with the previous tests in 2015, while England had better results in reading and maths countered by a fall in science. Scotland’s decline in science continued, although both it and Northern Ireland had improved scores in reading.Kirsty Williams, Wales’s minister for education, said the results showing students in Wales achieving close to the OECD averages in all three subjects were “positive but not perfect”.“For the first time ever, Wales is in the international mainstream, thanks to the efforts of our teachers and students. We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum,” Williams said.But experts warned that the results for inidual UK countries showed few differences from previous years, despite England’s improvement in mathsthat helped its ranking improve from 20th to 13th, putting it alongside Germany, Finland and Ireland.John Jerrim, a UCL professor of education who studies the Pisa process, said: “The big story in England will be that scores have gone up about 10 points higher in maths and that is not seen across the rest of the UK. I would say it’s far too early to call it a trend, and we can’t read too much into it yet.”The 2018 Pisa tests concentrated on reading, with the NFER’s analysis noting that there were no significant differences between reading scores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales’s reading score was “significantly lower” than the rest of the UK but not significantly different from the OECD average.Pisa’s survey of staff found headteachers in Scotland reporting more problems with pupil absence and teacher absenteeism than those in the rest of the UK. School leaders in Wales reported greater shortages of educational materials, and those in Northern Ireland were more likely to complain about inadequate buildings and infrastructure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/463af283adb3e81d0411a8032922c5c78bd707ef/0_15_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05341b9876126a5bb33848a667dbf520","title":"labours broadband plan could radically change young peoples life chances","story":"Researching the digital lives of teenagers brings with it great highs and lows. The highs are realising that new doors are opening for young people as they expand their horizons beyond their everyday worlds. The lows are different. Our research revealed young people in deprived areas are struggling to get online and stay connected. Some schools have poorly designed and funded IT systems and there are colleges that all but choke off digital engagement.Often, school is the only place where young people can access the internet freely, especially now many libraries have closed.We see parents in deprived areas paying a small fortune for subscriptions offering a few miserly kilobytes of decrepit and creaking copper broadband. This is happening not only in rural areas such as East Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, or the Orkneys but in urban internet cold spots such as parts of Hull, and the London boroughs of Southwark, Tower Hamlets and Westminster.In contrast, parents in more affluent areas are, in some cases, paying the same amount for high-speed fibre access.But however much you pay, your child’s internet access could still be compromised because of where they live, and whether there are major businesses in the local area prepared to demand better infrastructure.This is something Labour has promised to fix. By offering universal free high-speed broadband, they are in a position to profoundly change society, possibly even more than they realise.This manifesto commitment goes well beyond flinging an election freebie at voters largely able to pay for subscriptions themselves. This is because speed and access are not the only problems. When young people do access the internet, which is most likely to be through a mobile phone, they see different things: those in deprived areas are bombarded with burger and betting advertisements, while young people in more affluent areas are shown advertisements for university open days and sports equipment.In the US, students on the same course, in the same college, but living in different areas, can be charged different amounts for the same course book by online retailers. We could be heading in the same direction in the UK. The poorer the system thinks you are, the more it will charge you.How does it know to do that? Sneaky algorithms assess how far you live from a telephone exchange or mobile phone mast, whether you are accessing the internet by phone, copper or fibre broadband, the geolocation of your IP address, and even the monetary value and age of the device you are using. To be a long way from an ageing telephone exchange, using an old device, means you are likely to be routinely ripped off. That is the reality facing many young people in deprived areas today.The way to change this grubby commercial practice is to standardise provision. All our other utilities are what is known as “high reliability”, with electricity, gas and water coming out of pipes at the same rate and to the same standards regardless of how much you pay. The internet, the newest of the utilities, should provide the same degree of consistency and availability as everything else.Whether it should be completely free for everyone is another debate. We are lacking information about how Labour is planning to ensure investment levels are kept up over time. But standardising the highest quality provision for all? That is a beautifully subversive way of us telling the globalised tech robber barons that we are going to run our society, thank you very much, and not them. Young people and their education can only do well out of this.Sandra Leaton Gray is associate professor of education at UCL and director of the My Life Online research project.

I was looking forward to seeing you answer questions about such things as the expansion of grammar schools, the chronic underfunding of special needs provision and the just-as-chronic underfunding of school buildings maintenance.I was also hoping to see fact-checkers get to grips with whatever justification you might come up with for the academy and free schools programmes: just how much has it cost us, with what proven levels of success?Your party’s manifesto tells us you are going to “back heads to use exclusions” to implement “discipline”. I’m not confident that decisions about exclusion are being made solely on the basis of benefiting students and teachers.

That doesn’t look like a promise to create better education for all. The proven way to do this was the pioneering London Challenge programme put in place by Estelle Morris and Sir Tim Brighouse. Perhaps deep in the heart of your party, a commitment to “for all” went absent without leave some time ago.I see you’ve found a bit of pocket money (£110m a year for three years) for the arts in schools to “enrich activities for all pupils”. Is this a joke?The arts aren’t glitter. They offer pupils ways of exploring the world, materials and themselves through experiment, invention and open interpretation. Your department seems stuck in the era of chucking a few pence at schools to pay for a potter’s wheel but not for a kiln for the pots to be fired in.One of your jargonistas has been at work on primary school PE teaching, talking about “physical literacy”.Some years ago, some policy wonks in the building you work in turned “literature” into “literacy” and in a stroke made it less necessary to talk about what excites pupils about books. Now I see the “literacy” octopus has taken over running, jumping and climbing. Far be it for a book-freak such as me to admit it, but one of the exciting things about PE is that you can spend time not “doing literacy”.You’re promising £1bn on “boosting childcare”. Hello, factcheckers – is that a billion in fresh new money, or old money already allocated somewhere else? But if it will really help parents with childcare over the summer holidays, I welcome that.My tone of caution about facts derives from your porky-esque figure of a total £14bn extra for school funding. I think you have been warned against using that figure and that you should revise it down to £7.1bn a year. You know that thing where teachers ask pupils to “tell the truth”? Same goes for parents and ministers: we’d like you to tell the truth please.Very welcome is raising teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 and this, the unions tell us, may go some way towards encouraging recruitment to the profession. We parents like it when our children have classroom and subject teachers every day, every week, all year. This is not something all of us enjoy at the moment.If they let you loose on telly, I guess your minders will tell you to say that you’re going to improve things without implying that they’ve been crap for the last nine years when your party has been in power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f896686a2010e01d39b21bf1ffc4e37577f1dff7/0_166_4522_2714/master/4522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f0f6bdb08e7298555ec445c7e009074","title":"decade of exceptional heat likely to be hottest on record experts say","story":"World Meteorological Organization says 2019 is likely to be second or third warmest year everThe last decade has been one of “exceptional” heat around the world, and was almost certainly the hottest on record, while the oceans have also warmed to record levels and grown markedly more acidic, the World Meteorological Organization has said.Temperatures for the years from 2010 to 2019 were about 1.1C above the average for the pre-industrial period, showing how close the world is coming to the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will cause dramatic impacts, extreme weather and the loss of vital ecosystems.The preliminary findings of the State of the Global Climate, an annual publication by the WMO, show that this year is on course to be the second or third warmest since records began.Over land, the impacts from January to October have included severe droughts, heatwaves and floods across all inhabited continents, and over the seas there have also been heatwaves.During the past year, the upper levels of the oceans, measured since the 1950s, have exceeded previous records so far this year, and the ocean experienced about 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures, with large areas of the north-east Pacific showing severe heatwaves. The Arctic sea ice minimum in September was the third smallest on record. The final version of the report will be published in March.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, said the impacts of rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere were becoming ever more harmful, as demonstrated in this year’s extreme weather events. “Heatwaves and floods which used to be once-in-a-century events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,” he said.He warned that more erratic rainfall patterns posed a threat to crop yields which, combined with population increases, would mean “considerable food security challenges for vulnerable countries in the future”.The findings came as the world’s governments gathered in Madrid for a critical UN conference on the climate. On Monday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that though the technology and economic means to fight climate chaos were available, political will was lacking.He called on world leaders and governments to pay heed to young people, who were “showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation”.The latest WMO figures showed the pattern of warming was growing stronger, warned Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading.“Each of the past four decades has been 0.1 to 0.2C warmer than the decade before. Carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise, and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.”While average temperatures may seem to be only gradually creeping up over decades, this disguises the true impact on lives, explained Grant Allen, professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester.“These impacts are real and happening now and place huge pressures on communities and countries – put simply, these impacts make for a more unstable world, and are already having profound impacts on our ecosystems and bioersity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3378805f03d503809b4677fc3e7a4531144fa572/30_36_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668356dd2f44a6851f60b0ae1f475a5d","title":"uk firms urge brazil to stop amazon deforestation for soy production","story":"Tesco and Asda are among 67 firms and investors who have written to President BolsonaroTesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the UK’s largest asset manager are among 67 major companies and investors who have written to Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, urging his government to stop further deforestation of the Amazon for soy production.The preservation of the Amazon rainforest, a vital sink for carbon dioxide, is widely considered by scientists and activists to be a priority in responding to the climate crisis. However, the Brazilian soy farmers’ association Aprosoja has mounted a campaign to end a voluntary ban on trading crops harvested from newly cleared land.Aprosoja has claimed to have the backing of Bolsonaro, who has come under heavy international criticism as he advocated increased economic development of the Amazon even as vast fires burned swathes of rainforest during the summer. Many of those fires were started deliberately by farmers to clear land for crops or cattle.The letter to the Brazilian government calls for the extension of the Amazon soy moratorium (ASM), a 2006 agreement signed by companies to prevent the use of new land for the production of soy. Soy is used mainly as agricultural feed, as well as a food for human consumption such as tofu and soy sauce.The signatories to the letter include some of Europe and the UK’s largest supermarket chains – including Aldi, Asda, Carrefour, Iceland, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waitrose and Morrisons – and food producers such as Mars. Investor signatories, who together control assets worth more than £2.3tn, include the Dutch firm Robeco and the Canadian investor BMO Global Asset Management, as well as Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management, the UK’s largest asset manager.The letter said: “We want to be able to continue to source from, or invest in, the Brazilian soy industry but if the ASM is not maintained, this will risk our business with Brazilian soy.”Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents many of the signatories, said they were seeking assurances from the Brazilian government that the moratorium would remain.“Customers expect the products they buy not to harm the environment, and retailers invest heavily in their supply chains to deliver that as far as possible,” he said.The letter, which was coordinated by the Farm Animal Investment Risk \u0026amp Return Initiative, argued that continued increases in soy production were possible without further destroying the rainforest.Brazil was the world’s largest soybean exporter in 2016-17, sending 60.3m metric tonnes abroad, the vast majority to China’s rapidly expanding meat industry, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Lower land and labour costs than the US have made Brazil the key sources of soybeans to China.Bolsonaro’s widely condemned policies have drawn comparisons with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, who has also advocated deregulation – in the face of a global consensus in favour of action on the environment.In the US more than 70 CEOs, companies and union leaders signed a separate letter published on Monday calling for the US to remain within the Paris Climate Agreement, only weeks after Trump began the year-long process to exit the international accord.The signatories include two of the world’s biggest tech firms, Google and Microsoft, and the FTSE-listed energy company National Grid.John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, said: “The scale and potential impact of the climate crisis has never been more real. The promise of the Paris Agreement is one of a just and prosperous world – something that can only be achieved through a collective effort of business, unions and governments that places climate action at the heart of everything we do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189701d9c230a3a02db92d28e00a484d70986313/0_37_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd7cb5bbc8bd779b2e50b214685ed5d","title":"wild seed collectors turn indiana jones in search for resilient crops aoe","story":"More than 370 species were gathered during a six-year mission to widen the gene pool and ensure future food security The seeds of more than 370 wild crop species have been collected as part of a six-year Indiana Jones-style mission to widen the gene pool of staple crops and ensure future global food security in increasingly unpredictable growing conditions.A hundred scientists from 25 countries travelled by horse, canoe and even elephant to reach remote corners of the world in search of wild species of common agricultural crops such as rice, barley, beans and potatoes that billions of people rely on for basic nutrition.Domesticated crops are generally selected for their high yield and nutritional value but this means they have dangerously low genetic ersity. Their wild relatives – many of which are at risk of extinction – are sturdier because they have evolved to survive more challenging conditions.“These wild plants are related to a wide range of important crops,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, which ran the project in partnership with the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens’ Millennium Seed Bank project.“They hold the genetic ersity which breeders will need to improve those crops so we can feed 9 billion people with nutritious food.”For centuries scientists have travelled the world collecting plants – initially to grow in gardens – but increasingly they are looking to save seeds and store them in sub-zero vaults to ensure long-term survival.Collectors working on the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) project spent a total of 2,973 days in the field and saved 4,644 seed samples from 371 crop wild relatives, according to a report published by the Crop Trust. They found seeds from 28 globally important crops, including nine species of banana, 21 of wild barley, two species of wild potato and four of wild aubergine.Researchers examined gene banks across the world and identified which had dangerously low ersity before setting out on expeditions to far-flung parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. They used GPS to tag the location of their discoveries and silica gel to preserve the seeds.In one of the most treacherous expeditions, collectors in Nepal travelled on elephants to ward off tigers and rhinos. They found a species of wild rice (Oryza meyeriana) that is resistant to bacterial blight and collected a relative of the sweet potato (Ipomoea cairica) with high resistance to insect attack that can grow in salty soils.In Ecuador, collectors wore long plastic boots with metal tips to protect them from snakebites while collecting an elusive variety of high-yielding rice (Oryza grandiglumi) that is endemic to tropical America and tolerates flooding.Security concerns caused by al-Shabaab prevented collectors reaching their targets in the Lamu district of Kenya. Missions to north-eastern Nigeria were abandoned in 2015 and 2016 due to the Boko Haram insurgency but collectors were able to access the region in 2017.Dempewolf said: “The expeditions were not a walk in the park. They were perilous at times and physically demanding, with heat, dust, sweat and danger from wild animals – from blood-sucking leeches to tigers. The stories these seed collectors brought back from the field often resemble scenes from an Indiana Jones movie.”Seeds are only ripe for a narrow window of time and if collectors were too early they had to visit the site again. If they were too late they had to wait until the following year.Nicola Ardenghi from the University of Pavia in Italy spotted a type of pea with edible tubers while looking out of a train window between Piacenza and Milan – his team had almost given up hope before it was found.Many of these crops are already threatened with extinction due to deforestation, urban sprawl, conflict and the climate crisis. In some cases, wild crop relatives were already lost. For example in Costa Rica, land which was once home to wild rice has been turned into sugarcane plantations and tilapia ponds.Scientists say this work is more important than ever. “If we are to feed a growing population, we need to make our food crops more resilient. And crop wild relatives can help breeders develop new ‘climate-proof’ varieties,” said Marie Haga, the outgoing executive director of the Crop Trust.The wild relatives of crops share a “gene pool” which means that although they may be different species they are close enough relatives to exchange genetic traits. The collected samples are available to breeders and farmers everywhere and can be crossed with domesticated varieties.Work is already under way to develop 19 new crops with international partners in 38 countries. More than a dozen farmer seed clubs in the Mekong delta of Vietnam are testing rice derived from crosses with wild cousins.“This project has only succeeded thanks to the dedication and hard work of iniduals in organisations around the world working towards a common goal, to safeguard crop wild relatives, that previously were overlooked and disregarded, but probably hold the key to the world’s food security in the years ahead,” said Chris Cockel, Crop Wild Relatives project coordinator at Kew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57cbabf8fb13f562df6ddca16d1a69e236116425/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445c2120f1b90fd04ab3604264e0c8c","title":"50 best films of 2019 in the uk","story":"Our countdown of the top movies released in the UK in the past year includes gobstopping horror, kinky marriage, a space epic and a blockbuster superhero smackdown.

Or rather, they’re already here, and already launching the next step in a takeover by stealth that may only just be entering its imperial phase.English football has always had its own quiet obsession with American scale, American razzmatazz, and above all American money. In the late 1970s Jimmy Hill and his consortium members managed to lose a million dollars a year on the Washington Diplomats franchise in the North American Soccer League, a venture that saw Hill and co pay $200,000 to watch an injured, essentially immobile Johan Cruyff score a single brilliant goal from inside his own half before the whole thing folded.“I have never forgotten it, or how much it cost,” Hill wrote of that Cruyff goal in his autobiography. “And to this day I look very carefully at any business deal that arrives with an American accent.”On Sunday morning the US’s fifth richest corporation launched its own arrival as a Premier League player with a trip down the Thames on an Amazon Prime barge. Invited parties were offered the chance to hobnob with celebrity guests, perform some kind of “crossing skills” challenge, and generally do lots of things that have little to do with English football and quite a lot to with the more familiar business of high-end salesmanship.There is almost something reassuringly rickety about this unveiling, something reassuringly ITV Digital. English football has always been a stage for speculators. From flighty club chairmen to Rupert Murdoch’s dish-led transformation, the league carries the sweaty fingerprints of a century’s worth of rain-makers and carpetbaggers.At which point, enter Jeff Bezos, who distinguishes himself from this company first by his status as the planet’s wealthiest person, the man who sold the world back to itself in cardboard boxes. And second by the scale of Amazon’s operation, a footprint that allows the Premier League to be offered as a loss leader for the main business of overseeing the digital logistics of a large portion of the human race.Be afraid, traditional broadcasters and, indeed, traditional supporters. This could yet be a profound point of change. Kicking off with Crystal Palace v Bournemouth on Tuesday night Amazon will stream its package of 20 Premier League games across the next three and a half weeks. Coverage is bookended by a simulcast of five games on Wednesday night and then six – yes! Six! – on Boxing Day.Clive Tyldesley will act as the lead commentator. A mob-handed posse of 43 talking punditry heads has been hired, among them Harry Redknapp, Alan Shearer and Gabby Logan. It is a reassuringly glossy, reassuringly familiar-looking package, menaced only by the prospect of substandard UK streaming speeds.But step back a little and this is all part of a wider transatlantic insurgence. Bezos may have the look of a wide-eyed alien frontiersman, but he is following a well-trodden path. The arrival of the Silver Lake investment company at Manchester City last month means seven Premier League clubs now have some form of US ownership. Sky Sports, architect of the boom years, is a US-owned company these days following its sale last year to the broadcast giant Comcast.In the last few months even the newspaper industry has been jolted by the arrival of The Athletic, self-styled Netflix of sports writing, funded by American venture capitalists and openly hostile in its cash-splurging attack on the market share of traditional British media.At the end of which Wednesday night’s Merseyside derby will see British football fans watching the US-owned Premier League leaders on a US-based internet service – with the chance to read about it all on a US-owned subscription website the next day.This is, of course, a sign of continuing commercial good health. The Premier League has succeeded as a global product. Choice, we are told repeatedly, is only good. Welcome to the great global bazaar.And yet like every other aspect of football’s transformation, this comes with a price tag. Amazon’s entrance to the marketplace has been trumpeted as something entirely beneficial. News reports have described the deal as “breaking the stranglehold” of existing broadcasters. Some have written of the freebie offer to existing subscribers and new sign-ups as somehow returning football to free-to-air status (a laughable suggestion: Amazon is nothing if not a mindbogglingly expert cash-raking exercise).Players will earn more, clubs will spend more every part of the football industrial complex will welcome this frothing new income stream. But in reality this money comes, as ever, from those who pay to watch. The entry of BT Sport into this marketplace was similarly trumpeted as a golden moment of choice. In practice it became necessary for football supporters to pay twice, to engage with yet another monthly contract, just to receive essentially the same service.With the entry of a third major provider it remains a late-stage capitalism kind of choice. No matter how glossy and fun the Amazon product, how high the players’ salaries, English football fans are basically still being sold the same things they already owned in the first place.The prospects for genuine change depend on how far Amazon intends to go. This is a company with pockets deep enough to effectively take control, to blow Sky out of the water. Amazon Prime is the most profitable part of the business. With the Premier League thrown in it would perhaps generate significant growth in the same way Premier League football carried Sky’s early satellite service.But there are also hazards. The success of the English league is based on its strength in depth, which is in turn based around collective rights deals, the idea that all clubs in the top tier distribute revenue as evenly as possible. This is a kind of holy founding writ of the Premier League, the principle that allows clubs such as Leicester to challenge however briefly the dominance of the commercial giants.Some clubs, most notably Manchester City, have railed against this distinctly English way of doing things. Amazon’s streaming service would make it easier than ever to disregard, to sell access inidually at the click of a mouse, allowing the bigger clubs to pitch themselves as global revenue monsters to be measured only against Real Madrid, Barcelona, the Dallas Cowboys, the next series of Game of Thrones.For these reasons some will perhaps hope that Amazon is only dipping a toe in these waters. There is an opportunity to change this landscape completely, although into what is another question altogether. Greater revenue, a better service or another small step in English football’s journey into pure commodification."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/665b87b31c0e89aa6beac8c32eaec727349c3f4d/0_92_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb24167c3f830636bbc8cf8a5efc368","title":"megan rapinoe clean sweep ballon dor","story":"The Ballon d’Or is just the latest award for remarkable USA forward who has not shirked from voicing her opinionsIt is a clean sweep. Megan Rapinoe’s lifting of the Ballon d’Or adds to a stunning year for the 34-year-old forward. A World Cup, Golden Ball, Golden Boot, Fifa best player of the year is joined by perhaps the most coveted inidual prize.“I can’t believe I’m the one winning it in this field,” said Rapinoe, in a video because she was unable to attend the awards ceremony in Paris. With Uefa’s European player of the year, Lucy Bronze, finishing behind her, her USA teammate Alex Morgan third and a shortlist that included the NWSL and W-League top scorer, Sam Kerr and Arsenal’s WSL golden boot winner, and the Netherlands all-time top scorer, Vivianne Miedema, Rapinoe is right to be as humbled as she seemed.Yes, her domestic season was modest. No goals, no assists and six starts for Reign FC, partly owing to the NWSL season being played during the World Cup. However, it is hard to think of many others – any others – who could have shouldered the weight of on-field and off-field responsibilities in such empathic style.Critics point to the three penalties that contributed to Rapinoe’s six World Cup goals as a sign of the winger benefiting from a heavy dose of good fortune. But where she stepped up, many others faltered. At 1-0 down in their last-16 tie against Sweden, Canada’s record goalscorer, Christine Sinclair, who was then two goals shy of the international goal-scoring record, passed the penalty-taking buck on to Manchester City’s Janine Beckie, whose effort was saved.Nikita Parris’s two penalty misses against Argentina and Norway led to her being relieved of that particular duty, leaving Steph Houghton to step up and attempt to level their semi-final with USA from the spot. Her tame effort was saved by Alyssa Naeher. In other words, taking penalties is not easy and taking penalties in a World Cup is even harder.The calm efficiency with which Rapinoe dispatched one after another is worthy of praise, not criticism. That she did while surrounded by a media frenzy that would provoke many others to buckle is all the more impressive.When the video emerged of Rapinoe saying: “I’m not going to the fucking White House” in response to being asked whether the USA team would visit Donald Trump should they win the World Cup and receive an invitation, she could have distanced herself and chosen to adopt the often repeated “I’m focused on the football” mantra. Instead she embraced the platform she had been given.“Megan should win first before she talks,” Trump tweeted in response. “Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her \u0026amp the team.”With her own words threatening to come back and bite her, Rapinoe scored twice. Not in a walkable game but in a quarter-final against the hosts, France, at Parc des Princes, a game many had hoped would be the final.Via video in Paris on Monday, the 34-year-old’s message was unusually standard, a series of thank yous “to my teammates, coaches and the US Soccer Federation for allowing me to be the person I am on the pitch but also the one I am off it.”It is possible Rapinoe felt she had said her piece at September’s Fifa Best awards. There she used a brutally honest and radical speech to condemn racism and homophobia, launching an impassioned plea to the footballing elite and beyond to “lend your platform to other people. Lift other people up. Share your success. We have a unique opportunity in football, different to any other sport in the world, to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. That’s my charge to everyone. I hope you take that to heart and just do something. Do anything.”Her nod to Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly’s stances on racism, Iran’s “Blue Girl” Sahar Khodayari, the gay footballer Collin Martin, female LGBTQ footballers and the battle for equal pay was coupled with a call to arms, a challenge for their voices not to be the lone voice.In 2019, Rapinoe has discovered how best to use her voice to amplify those of others. That the chant of “equal pay” echoed from the Stade de Lyon to the field of Burlington high school reflects how far her and the influence of the US team extends.

The Bulgaria football union were also fined €75,000.The sanction was criticised by the anti-discrimination network Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), which said it was disappointed Bulgaria had not been expelled from the competition after being found guilty of a third offence this year, while Kick It Out said Uefa had “missed an opportunity” to send the right message.Uefa has been criticised for its handling of another cases – especially by black players – and Ceferin has conceded that a different, stronger approach is required to tackle what appears to be a worsening problem.Ceferin became president in September 2016 having been the president of Slovenia’s football association for the previous five years. Asked by the Mirror if he had underestimated how badly European football was blighted by racism, the one-time lawyer said: “Yes, I did. The situation in Europe is more and more tense. You can feel it.”Ceferin believes politicians are in part to blame for stoking racism across the continent and is particularly critical of Boris Johnson, who himself had criticised Uefa for their sanctions against Bulgaria.“When a politician who calls women with burqas postboxes or mailboxes then says publicly that he condemns you Uefa – do you reply to that?” Ceferin said. “Do you believe it’s honest? Come on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c565b9e7b7618e440e297e3b3df729fafb60ff50/42_93_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c59a5fc2c1b98e9bbda189797999d2a","title":"unai emery language barrier english manager premier league","story":"Spaniard did not fail at Arsenal because of his poor English, but for a modern Premier League manager language is a weapon to be used with precision and nuanceThe first question of the press conference was about Petr Cech. The veteran Arsenal goalkeeper had just announced his retirement from football at the end of the season, and as Unai Emery was asked to offer some words of tribute you could see the cogs whirring in his head as he composed his response. A short pause. “Good afternoon,” he began with his customary courtesy. “First, I think he’s a very big person.”Certainly there could be no qualms about the factual content of the statement, given Cech’s height of 6ft 5in. Yet the suspicion remained that this was not quite the glowing tribute to his outgoing stalwart that Arsenal’s manager had quite intended. And as Emery departs north London, the suspicion remains that it is little comic vignettes like this – as much as anything he achieved on the pitch – that will be the true legacy of his time at Arsenal.Let’s be clear about one thing from the outset: Emery didn’t lose his job at Arsenal because of his language skills. Failure has a nasty habit of amplifying a man’s traits into flaws, and had Arsenal qualified for the Champions League or made a stronger start this season, Emery’s arresting linguistic salad would have been the least of anybody’s concerns.There were also times, to be fair, when the parody of Emery’s English verged on unkindness. It was ultimately to his credit that he tried, even though by his own admission his level was mixed. And if the results occasionally felt as if he was running his own speech through a sort of real-time Google Translate, it takes a certain conviction to eschew the translator and face the cameras in your third language. As Tennyson almost wrote, perhaps ‘tis better to have spoken and garbled than never to have spoken at all.Yet as results began to e, it clearly became an issue: not just in the media but, by all accounts, in the dressing room too. The fact he was perfectly capable of great eloquence in his Spanish-language interviews hardly helped matters. Nor did having to follow Arsène Wenger, perhaps the most articulate foreign manager ever to have worked in the English game. The contrast between “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art” and “All the people who work here, I think they help us for all the work” was always going to jar slightly.Perhaps there are wider traits at work here, too. Emery is by no means the first manager to arrive on these shores and have problems with the language. But whereas the struggles of Claudio Ranieri, Juande Ramos and Fabio Capello were regarded as surmountable obstacles – even quaint affectations – Emery’s are somehow regarded as symptomatic of a wider failure. The real lesson here, for Emery and others, is the way that communication – always an essential part of the manager’s armoury – is becoming, in many ways, the very point of the job.Back in those giddy early days, as the first overseas managers began to plant their flags like pilgrims, there was a certain bemusing fascination to the armies of translators and misunderstandings they brought with them. How we chuckled when Ossie Ardiles pronounced it “Tottingham”, or when Capello referred to the former Milan players “Rye Wilkins” and “Mark Hatley” during his first press conference as England manager.By the current decade our patience for foreigners butchering the Queen’s had clearly begun to wear thin. Despite speaking excellent English, André Villas-Boas was roundly ridiculed for his eclectic turns of phrase: Michael Dawson being “a player of immense human dimension” or Jermain Defoe being able to “smell every cross”. In his autobiography, the former Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher openly scoffed at Villas-Boas’s language skills when he came to interview for a job. “Would Burnley players have understood ‘solidificate’, or some of his other terms?” Fletcher wrote. To which the answer is: um, probably yes.Now, it seems, we’ve come full circle. In an age where clubs are as much made-for-television entertainment vehicles as sporting enterprises, the role of the coach has subtly shifted. Once primarily a behind-the-scenes job, the modern Premier League coach is essentially that of a televangelist. The league position is now largely determined by wage bill, recruitment by the transfer committee, contract negotiations by the board, style of play by the sporting director. The coach’s primary function is thus to tell a story compelling enough that everyone – dressing room, owners, broadcasters and fans – will jump on for the ride.The leading managers in the game – Guardiola, Klopp, Pochettino, Mourinho – recognise this instinctively. Under these new rules, language is no longer an option but a weapon to be used with all due precision and nuance. It is why Diego Simeone will probably never manage in England, why the stock of quieter, less loquacious managers David Moyes and Mark Hughes has never been lower.There is a story about Moyes from his time at Manchester United, when in order to help him prepare for an upcoming press conference, the club’s media team prepared him a sheet of likely questions he might receive. Moyes studied it intently, turned it over, and then with a mixture of incredulity and apoplexy blurted out: “But where’s the answers?”This, essentially, is where Emery erred. His mistake, above all, was to believe that his work would do his talking for him. Ultimately, however, his failure to articulate a coherent identity for Arsenal, to sell himself and his methods, his refusal to feed the dream machine, would hasten his downfall. After all: there’s little point in being able to speak a language if you have nothing to say in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7bffcfe0510f7e54d09fa9c0c79202e105a92c/0_136_1599_959/master/1599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6316e06eb56a61c7eee745ca0375ba","title":"how we met i never thought id end up with a woman","story":"Holly and Sian Burford-Thomas, 39 and 36, met at a job interview in 2006. They live in Suffolk with their two-year-old daughter and two catsFor Holly and Sian, a job interview at the end of 2006 kicked off a love story they weren’t expecting. “I was managing the New Players theatre in Charing Cross in London and looking for a front-of-house manager,” Holly says. “When Sian came in, it was a very serious interview, but I did think: ‘Wow – she’s fit.’” During a tour of the theatre, she felt a “jolt of electricity”.As for Sian, she considered herself heterosexual. Yet, when she was offered the job, she had a feeling that it could change her life. “I wasn’t sure why, but it felt like a really big decision.”The pair quickly formed a close friendship. “My friends were wary of her at first,” says Holly. “They thought I was falling for a straight girl and that I’d get my heart broken.” In a “work hard, play hard” atmosphere, they enjoyed drinking together at the pub in the evenings. “One day, I ended up giving her an Indian head massage,” says Sian. Looking back, there must have been more going on than she realised.It wasn’t until Holly went away for a month for an operation that Sian started to question her feelings. “I think these days it’s easier to be gay, but at the time it was still seen as quite a big deal. It felt like something we’d have to keep secret.”Although she had “never connected with anyone like that before”, she was conflicted. When Holly returned in March 2007, Sian went to see her. “She came to my house to tell me that she was ‘definitely not interested in women’,” Holly remembers. But after spotting Sian’s overnight bag, she wasn’t sure that she meant it.“I knew I’d fallen for her, but it seemed easier to walk away,” explains Sian. She quickly changed her mind. “We’d had a few drinks and I remember thinking that I needed to live passionately, so I just decided to go for it. You have to grasp life with both hands,” she says.“Plus, you probably didn’t want to get the night bus home,” Holly laughs.They celebrated their love with a civil partnership in 2012, getting married four years later. “It seemed important to do, because it’s taken such a fight to get here,” says Holly.Although it took Sian longer to recognise the romantic nature of their relationship, she can’t imagine life without her partner. “I’ve met someone who understands me completely and utterly,” she says. “Holly is so genuine, caring, funny and loyal. I don’t know if it’s possible to put into words the connection of meeting ‘the one’.”For Holly, it was her partner’s warmth and kindness that stood out. “She has this amazing aura she’s a beautiful person.”In 2013, the couple moved to Shetland after Holly was offered a new job. “It’s such an amazing place and it was an incredible adventure,” says Sian. The couple spent their time exploring the outdoors. “We loved it there, but we were so far from friends and family and we knew we wanted to start a family.”They made the decision to return to England 18 months later, bringing back their three rescue cats. “We were actually together for a few years before we succumbed to the lesbian cat stereotype,” says Holly. “Although, sadly, one died, so we just have two now.” They had a daughter in 2017 – Sian carried her – and now live in a small town in Suffolk.“We haven’t always had it easy in terms of acceptance from others,” says Holly. “But we’re very lucky to have each other.”Sian agrees. “Sometimes you have to fight for the person you love. I never thought I’d end up with a woman. But love is genderless. You fall in love with a person and for me that’s Holly.”•Want to share your story?

It was approximately 15ft long and in retrospect had no good games designed for it. The Scope wound up the way of all console peripherals: propped in the corner of the lounge, useless, like a piece of pipe a plumber had forgotten to clear away. Until we had guests and my parents implored me to keep my bazooka in the bedroom.I still think about it, so was intrigued when I saw a new Nintendo console and peripheral on the market. This one targets the fitness crowd and I can justify playing it as part of what I insist on calling my job.The Switch itself is heavy and handsomely built, with two dinky, removable controllers. I slot one into the handheld wheel and place the other into a holster as directed, strapping it to the front of my thigh. It will measure how high I lift my knees when jogging and how low I drop a squat (all the way to the floor, baby, for a quick nap).I turn it on and I am confronted by an endless boardwalk that needs running down, apparently. Hmm. Yet considering we’re talking about a pilates ring and a remote control stuck to my leg, I’m surprised at how expansive the possibilities are. You control the character onscreen by running in place and squeezing the ring in and out to hoover up coins, bust open crates and leap chasms. You can shoot weaponised air puffs, too. Are these farts? Probably not, although I am exerting myself a lot. There are about 100 levels, over 20 different worlds, and attack moves based on knee lifts, ab crunches and the like. I’m getting a full, hard workout, which I didn’t expect and don’t look good doing. Is there anything less attractive than a grown man playing computer games in the afternoon while heavily sweating?There are addictive little standalone games included: air go-karting, being a human pinball or parachute, or the most bizarre of all, sculpting a clay pot via chair poses. Squatty pottery aside, where I anticipated gimmickry and tedium, the main game provides a legitimate, varied workout and complex gameplay.I was feeling fairly positive about its health potential until I invited my genuinely fit friend Chris to give the game a go. It’s hypnotic to watch, an athletic man tippy-tapping the carpet on besocked toes, trying to trick the computer into thinking he is running quickly. He looked like a cartoon raccoon stealing a custard bun. Thanks to the eagle-eyed thigh sensor, he wasn’t getting away with it, either. It was a vision of the ridiculous, which led me to understand there is little dignity to be had playing this game.Also, after playing Ring Fit for several days, I realised that I had been missing fresh air. I don’t really want a “fun workout”. I don’t want any workout at all. I’m too lazy and proud for Ring Fit. And I don’t think hardcore gymnasium-rabbits will be replacing their daily reps with this childish game, either.But, for the casually fitness-interested, it’s probably the most exciting way to get into resistance training. Whether you’re inclined to log on or jog on, Nintendo deserves respect for that.The Switch’s screen is small, so this workout would be intensified if enlarged on a TV. I recently got rid of mine, in an attempt to restore my pre-digital personality. Turns out I was never that interesting. And I can’t watch Friends any more.One ring to rule the mall. 45 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Pinballing from viral buzz to full-fledged chart sensation can lead to a slapdash live show, as artists struggle to scale up their music. But, in an ambitious evening in which London’s Hammersmith Apollo is packed to its scalloped rafters, Kennedy neatly sidesteps any teething troubles.Tonight his music gains an impressive sense of scale, with a three-piece band framed by intertwining tree trunks and a giant video screen showing abstract images (swooping birds, the white of an eye). Yet Kennedy’s versatile voice is the real draw. At times, it could soundtrack a Netflix weepie at others, he sounds like a grizzled sailor. The hip-hopindie hybrid Outnumbered is speeded up, its rapped verses sharpened, while acoustic mea culpa For Island Fires and Family is played to pin-drop silence.Kennedy deftly blends stagey moments with intimacy on the gospel-inspired Glory: the stage is drenched in red light and dry ice, recalling Bat Out of Hell: The Musical. Yet he quickly snuffs out theatrics for a touching singalong. For the devoted ballad After Rain, fans pull out paper sleeves, transforming their phone lights to lanterns.He brings an of-the-moment dynamism to Radio 2-friendly balladry, but the formula of hushed verses and booming choruses begins to wear.

By  John Harris and  John DomokosIf you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way inidual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made as one side understands, the other feels heard.Since 2010, we have been responsible for the  video series Anywhere But Westminster, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do.In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting.When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: “Excuse me. We’re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?”In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers’ union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to the footage we shot time and again. Sometimes, we don’t ask for people’s names (it can make people feel a bit like they’re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as “Step Man”. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell’s campaign leaflets.John Harris: “So you’ve had one of these through your door?”JH: “What do you think of him, and the fact that he’s left the Conservative party?”SM: “Good for him. It’s about time somebody got up and spoke.”JH: “Right now, what’s wrong with Britain?”SM: “Well, nobody’s doing anything are they? It’s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.”JH: “Have they done anything for Jaywick lately?”SM: “Nothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.”SM: “Everything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We’re a backwater, aren’t we? That nobody gives a shit about.”JH: “Who did you used to vote for in the past?”JH: “And what changed?”SM: “Well, bloody Blair. Let’s face it, he did sod all for this country … And now he’s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.”SM: “Well, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.”JH: “Do you think he’ll help Jaywick?”JH: “Time was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?”SM: “Course it was. Course it was.”SM: “Bloody Thatcher got in – destroyed it, didn’t she? Done the working classes, didn’t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.”JH: “But Ukip’s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee’s knees.”SM: “I don’t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?”JH: “But somebody with your politics shouldn’t be voting for him.”Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people’s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled Chronique d’un été (Chronicle of a Summer) based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: “Are you happy?” Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (“I went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun – I discovered it wasn’t a question of yes or no, but how many,” he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages – the bit that usually comes near the end to show some “extra views of the subject matter in hand”, to quote one set of BBC guidelines.But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there.The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour’s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party’s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed “the squeezed middle”. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (“I’m working-class,” said one man, “why’s it always about the middle?”), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away.With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the , we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous.The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham – one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan – who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and completely detached from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by telling us they still thought about the 1980s miners’ strike “every day”, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, she told us that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, “One of the most exciting things that’s ever happened.”Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that’s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again.The films we were making were shaped by what we ined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with “Who are you going to vote for?” or “What do you think about Brexit?”, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: “What’s it like living here?” or “How do you feel about the future?” We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people’s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes.As we spoke to people, we sensed that the gap between politics, the media and the public was widening. It was also becoming unsustainable. “They’re all in it for themselves, they don’t care about us” may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning.From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals – big speeches, appearances on daytime TV – increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop – the literal “voice of the people” – has itself become the focus of angry debate.Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC’s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the “middle ground”. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn’t seem to stem the torrent: “I’m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.” “Ban all vox pops on the news. I really don’t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.” “Another day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.”In March this year, as Theresa May’s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: “BBC News are once again doing that thing: ‘We sent our reporter to … a Leave constituency, always. Because that’s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.”Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: “If I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I’d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I’d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.”But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media’s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package – suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided – and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply.The superficial presentation of people’s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of “the people” is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of ision and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician Matteo Salvini. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation’s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the “Australian-style points system”. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people’s sense of grievance – deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, “the people” are one-dimensional so are the solutions. When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters’ methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating “shy Tories”). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters.But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the “filter bubble”: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, “moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.”We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn’t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media.But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully ined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work talking to people. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat.In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug’s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this “availability bias”. In simple terms, you can’t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day.In May 2016, the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there – people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible.We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as “in” and “out”. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. “Out,” he shot back. In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth’s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners – who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment.We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. “I fear for the kids – for my grandkids and that,” said one woman. “Jobs, and things like that: so I’m looking at pulling out.”Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. “I’m looking at immigration,” he said. “I studied environmental health, and I can’t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I’ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It’s affected me. And the thing is … I’m pulling out.”We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. The conversation was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war.Woman 1: “Collyhurst is coming up again. It’s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.”JH: “Have people in power talked about spending money here?”W1: “They’ve had the gardens done, but that’s it. Nothing else. There’s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it’s a lovely place to live.”JH: “But booming, thriving Manchester’s only 10 minutes’ drive down there.”W1: “Years ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There’s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.”JH: “It’s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it.JH: “What I find odd coming here, is that they’ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester … ”JH: “But you haven’t had money spent here.”John Domokos: “I’m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.”Woman 1: “It’s people with money. People with money. Money talks!”JH: “Last question. How are you voting in this referendum?”W1 and W2, loudly and emphatically: “Out!”JH: “They’re all voting ‘in’ in town.”JH: “So it’s down to a very simple thing for you – those who’ve got money vote which way?”JH: “And those who haven’t got as much money?”W1: “To come out.”We didn’t predict the referendum result. But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the “left behind” briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May’s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing.A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative.Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as “the tin man”.Tin Man: “Are you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?”JH: “Is it that bad?”TM: “Well, don’t you think it’s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn’t that a sign of a fascist country?”JH: “I meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we’re getting out and things are going their way.”TM: “Yeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it’s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn’t manufacture anything any more. We’re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It’s not helping us, mate. People have been conned.” JH: “Do you have a meaningful option in this election, do you think?”TM: “Absolutely. For the first time ever I think we’ve genuinely got a choice.”JH: “And the choice is?”TM: “To do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.”JD: “What’s it like being disabled in the current climate?”JD: “The crux of this is … ”JH: “We met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.”TM: “That’s just ridiculous, isn’t it? He’s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.”We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat.Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised.In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain’s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don’t have a huge Twitter following. And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy.One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully – that’s how people tend to behave when they come face to face.Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other.Two weeks ago, after we had finished filming in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes.JH: “Hello. I don’t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.”JH: “Can we talk to you again?”SM: “Not really. I’m not very well at the moment. I’ve got emphysema.”JH: “What do you think of the state of the country?”JH: “Do you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?”JH: “Did you vote in the referendum?”SM: “Of course I did. And I voted to leave.”JH: “How do you feel about that?”SM: “Well, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they’re doing.”SM: “Oh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.”JH: “Are you going to vote in the election?”SM: “Of course I am.”JH: “Who are you going to vote for?”SM: “I’ve voted Labour all my life, and I’m not going to vote for Corbyn. He’s not doing the working classes any good at all.”JH: “So if not him, who are you going to vote for?”JH: “God – you’re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?”SM: “Yeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.”JH: “But what’s he going to do to the country?”SM: “Well, I don’t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.”JH: “Eton-educated, very wealthy … ”SM: “I wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.”JH: “And the future of the country? How do you feel about that?”SM: “Well, I’d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this … Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors – I’ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night – all these arseholes who’ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.”JH: “And you’ve had that experience?”SM: “Yes. Many, many times.”JH: “When you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?”SM: “Of course it was.”SM: “We don’t know yet.”JH: “You were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don’t make anything better.”SM: “Yeah, but I can’t see Corbyn making it any better.”JH: “The conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.”It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes – “See you later, my old mate,” he said – and he closed the window and went back inside, after we’d asked him his name. He told us it was Frank.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c1887ab067dd4cf54f1fb024cb15478d0fe9f99/246_466_5474_3285/master/5474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04e9695e82285e53e09d56e9f6dd19ce","title":"uk six richest people control as much wealth as poorest 13m study","story":"‘Extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks,’ says the Equality TrustThe UK’s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million, according to research into the gaping inequality in British society.Six billionaires at the top of the UK wealth league have a combined fortune of £39.4bn, which, according to analysis by the Equality Trust, is roughly equal to the assets of 13.2 million Britons.The richest six are: the Indian brothers Gopichand and Srichand Hinduja, who control a conglomerate of businesses, including cars and banks, and top the table with a £12.8bn fortune Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chairman and chief executive of the chemicals company Ineos, with £9.2bn the hedge fund manager Michael Platt, who has an estimated £6.1bn and the property developer brothers David and Simon Reuben, whose net worth is estimated at £5.7bn each. The estimates are based on wealth reports produced by Forbes magazine and Credit Suisse.“This report should shock anyone who cares about the state of the UK today,” said Dr Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust. “Such a huge gap between the very rich and the vast majority of the country is dangerous. Such extreme wealth in the hands of so few people demonstrates just how broken the economic system is.“Behind the numbers, the UK’s extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks. Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future. The rich live longer and their children get the best education, the best jobs and a leg up on the housing ladder. The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.”Tackling inequality has become a key battle ground in the general election campaign, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, vowing that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a “rigged system” to benefit themselves at the expense of the many.Corbyn named five other members of “the elite” he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire and Ratcliffe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df6c414a5963d0924cfd94e9952c3551adc6b4f0/0_0_5334_3201/master/5334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=617c0c993592b73d87436dcafc7b6fda","title":"digital election what demographics are the parties targeting","story":"Labour use a broad brush to target the many, while the Tories get dirty on FacebookAs we approach the final week of the general election campaign, the political parties are beginning to ramp up their social media activity in the hopes of swaying undecided voters.Conservative party sources briefed the Times that they were planning a last-minute advertising blitz reminiscent of the successful Vote Leave campaign of 2016.Facebook’s new ad library provides demographic data on the kinds of people who are viewing (or being targeted by) those ads. This week we’re examining that data to see how the parties are reaching out to different groups.Throughout the campaign we’ve been reviewing which adverts get the most attention. Some of the top performers have consistently been “Stop Brexit” ads from the Liberal Democrats, or other pro-Remain messages.The Liberal Democrats’ ads appear to have been targeted overwhelmingly at younger voters. Almost two thirds of views of Lib Dem campaign ads were from users aged between 18 and 34, according to a  analysis.Advertising only to younger voters is a risky strategy, since the conventional wisdom is that older voters are more likely to turn out on polling day.However the Lib Dem campaign has not been exclusively directed at 18- to 34-year-olds. Over the weekend the party launched a slew of adverts attacking Boris Johnson, which appear to have been viewed mostly by older users.The party launched several ads promoting its NHS policies in recent days, some of which have been viewed exclusively by male users, according to Facebook’s data.Over the weekend the Conservatives also repackaged a clip of a Sky News interview with Jeremy Corbyn about the London Bridge terrorist attack as a Facebook advert. At time of writing, three quarters of those who had viewed it were male.The ads includes a claim that Labour “want weaker sentences” for terrorism offences – in truth the party has made no such commitment.Our analysis shows that unlike the Lib Dems, with their focus on young voters, the Labour party have promoted their Facebook advertising much more broadly across all ages.Total spending on Facebook and Instagram adverts between the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Brexit party has now passed the £1m. The Tories are still spending relatively low amounts on the platform, though some have suggested that will change closer to polling day.While Labour do not appear to be particularly focusing on younger voters on Facebook, the party is by far the most successful on Snapchat, a platform which has a relatively young user base.Many Snapchat ads are promoting voter registration, targeting a younger demographic that has historically been less likely to vote. The biggest spender was not a political party but the non-partisan voter registration campaign Vote for your Future, which has spent £40,000 on 83 ads so far.Labour was the second biggest spender, taking out £25,000 worth of ads, almost eight times more than the Conservatives. Labour has placed just three ads during this time, but has received a total of 19m impressions, compared with the Conservatives’ 2m. Labour’s latest ad ran for three days up until the voter registration deadline, receiving almost 6m views.The Tories have not taken out any ads around voter registration and have not spent any money on the platform since 8 November.As we enter the last days of the campaign the Liberal Democrats have finally started placing ads on Snapchat. The party paid for 11 ads at just over £100 apiece, all placed on the same day, suggesting they are still in the testing phase.Data was gathered from the Facebook Ad Library API though keyword searches for the main political parties, restricting to ads served from midnight 29 October onwards. Facebook provides impressions in ranges. To calculate percentages of ad views, the age and gender distributions of each ad were multiplied by the lower bound of impressions. This was then summed by party and ided by the total lower bound of impressions for that party. Figures were correct as of 11:00 on Monday. Snapchat data covers the period 29 October to 29 November.Digital dashboard team: Michael Barton, Pamela Duncan, Niamh McIntyre, David Pegg and Joseph Smith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a626b61ab04234750c98bcf03940d4da70e8453/171_404_6281_3769/master/6281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c957ae249cda3dc73dcd922d9c8e24","title":"on road with jeremy corbyn a photo essay","story":"As the Labour leader fights his second general election,  photographer  Sean Smith joins the campaign trailI started photographing Jeremy Corbyn during the leadership contest before the 2015 election. After a short time covering him on the campaign trail, I thought he would do a lot better then people expected. By the time of the next general election, in 2017, I, probably in a minority of one, thought he could win.Corbyn is quite relaxed with a camera around. When we first met, he would ask: “What do you want? What should I do?” But now he understands I’m not trying to do photocall pictures I want it to be as if I wasn’t there.To start with I didn’t have much special access, but over time I persistently asked to follow him. I don’t think the Labour team ever started to trust me, but they did start to tolerate me.I wasn’t expecting him to do the Eric Morecambe pose. I didn’t suggest it. A member of the public asked to do one with him and then he got Lizzi to do one, too. It was very spontaneous.Corbyn is much more relaxed and open than his minders from the press team. He said to me once, “Oh Sean, are you coming on the train with me?” and suddenly all of his people looked worried I could see them thinking, “Oh no, don’t invite him – what are you doing?”He seems very happy and rejuvenated when he’s on the road and appears to prefer it to being in Westminster: I think he feels it’s a bit of a club, an echo chamber. On the road, he seems genuinely engaged, albeit mostly with Labour party members. Perhaps he should go after a few Tories, too.He’s got more energy than I do. I was with him in Hartlepool one day, back in Islington the next: he couldn’t resist popping into a tiny local street festival where there was an Elvis impersonator. Everyone there wanted to say hello to him, even the police officers. When he’s preparing a speech, he does very brief notes to himself. It seems like he’s writing prompts. In Tolpuddle, he was making his notes in a porch behind the stage, where a musician had left a guitar.I think Corbyn is the only politician I’ve photographed who doesn’t have that lifelong ambition to be prime minister. I’ve never come across anyone like that. All the others, even if there is no possibility of it happening, have that occasional glint in their eye at the thought of “what if?”. For him, agree with him or not, it is all about the policies he deeply believes in it is not about personal ambition. I think even his enemies would agree with that.I think he’s a lot more steely and capable than people think. From the little work I’ve done with Boris Johnson, he’s more desperate to be loved than Corbyn the prime minister seems to get hurt if people don’t like him.It’s become harder to get proper time with politicians. Margaret Thatcher was a lot easier to photograph than Tony Blair or David Cameron. They want to stage-manage and control things. With these shots, I feel I got some of those rare candid moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53dfee520fc00c86fd77ee36d373f13841109956/0_120_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812409e3aab21f8a3d16704235d9cdea","title":"anthony joshua andy ruiz jr rematch riyadh boxing","story":"• Extra sparring and dietary changes for Saudi Arabia rematch• Joshua aims to reclaim heavyweight titles on SaturdayAnthony Joshua claims he has adopted a “prison mindset” and become even more dedicated in his search for redemption against Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday night.Joshua said he spent his 30th birthday in digs in Sheffield, has cut out salt and invested significantly on top‑quality sparring partners in a bid to win back his title.The former WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion said he has the same “lockdown” attitude he had as a youngster after nearly going to jail – when he prayed for a second chance at life – into his preparations.“When I went into boxing, I was getting into a lot of trouble,” Joshua said. “I had a major court case and I prayed: ‘God, if you give me a second chance at life I will make all the changes in the world.’ When I beat that court case, I got into boxing and I focused.“Same thing with Ruiz, give me a second chance at life and see what I can do. I just dedicated myself. I said I would put myself on a 15-year prison sentence to boxing and have that focus.”That was in 2008 but when it was put to Joshua that he might retire in 2023 he replied: “I could go on longer. It’s just a mindset, a prison mindset, like a military mindset, lockdown. Training, focus, sleep. You have to have that mindset. You have to be in that regimen.”That includes celebrating his birthday at his digs in Sheffield where he talked to his nutritionist Mark Ellison about training. “I live boxing, I live it, that’s all I do,” Joshua said. “I have a lot more energy now I am no longer focused on any other opponent than Ruiz.”Joshua has also corrected the failings of his first camp against Ruiz, when he lacked sparring partners who could replicate the Mexican-American’s style and paid the price when he was stopped in the seventh round.“Sparring is important because it is the closest thing you can get to the fight,” Joshua said. “We don’t always want to do it because it is a big cost but it’s the best way to prepare. They throw everything at me, if I do 12 rounds then it’s with five different people back-to-back and I am dealing with every shot coming at me.“Ruiz doesn’t get enough credit for his jab. We need to be prepared for that, which is why we got so many sparring partners in.”Joshua has also been speaking regularly to Wladimir Klitschko, who has given him “tonnes of advice” on cutting out salt, improving his hydration and how to prepare his body better. “It’s almost good that I lost because all of the sparring partners are coming out of the woodwork now, no one wanted to spar me before,” Joshua said.“Klitschko told me it would happen, he said he could only get good sparring after he had lost. It’s ended up like a blessing because everyone wants to come to the gym now. When we lace the gloves up now there is no holding back.”“You have someone like Vasyl Lomachenko, who is great but then you have some who get better with every fight, like Canelo Álvarez, and that is what I am. You are going to see me get better every step of the way. One loss can’t strip your skin off overnight, when you put your solid foundations in, one chip in the brick can’t destroy the whole building.”Joshua said he has watched the first fight repeatedly in slow-motion, looking for how he could correct his mistakes. “Until he caught me, I was beating him to the punch,” he said. “They are all quick, but first two or three rounds I was beating him to the punch. He got hurt, I just have to keep down this time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371999adca14576ff4b1c24afc14d62cb1dbb792/0_61_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2905f2fb3594037d4ebe301ba4fcea3","title":"drawn second test hands new zealand 1 0 series win over england","story":"The rains began in Hamilton at 1.55pm and by 3.53pm the umpires had seen enough. The second Test between New Zealand and England was called off as a draw and with it the hosts had secured a 1-0 series win – their fifth in a row at home.That result had looked inevitable regardless as, on a heartbreaking pitch that barely looked used even by the fifth day, New Zealand had moved to 241 for two in their second innings – a lead of 140 runs – and the chances of a collapse looking minimal.Just five overs had been bowled after lunch but it was enough time for both Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor to complete unbeaten centuries before they depart on Saturday for a three-Test tour of Australia, reaching 104 and 105 respectively.Williamson, resuming on 96 after the interval, might have been run out when chasing a risky second only for Sam Curran to miss with his shy at the stumps, before sweeping a four to fine leg off Joe Root’s bowling made it Test century No 21.Taylor, with the rain already starting to spit in the England captain’s next over, then when four, four, six with a succession of swept slogs to register his 19th hundred. Two balls later and the players were off, seeking shelter in the pavilion as a good-natured series decided by New Zealand’s innings-victory in Mount Maunganui ended with handshakes.For Root’s tourists, it was one where lessons were learned too late. The captain’s double-century shored up his own position amid some rising debate, Rory Burns made 101, while there were encouraging performances for Ollie Pope, 74, and Chris Woakes who claimed four wickets for 95 on his return to the side.But even on the final morning, when New Zealand resumed on 96 for two, there was a reminder of England’s struggles with the Kookaburra ball in hand across the two matches and a couple moments that summed up their catching when Williamson somehow enjoyed lives on 39 and 62.The first came in the fourth over of the day when Ben Stokes, the man to drop BJ Watling on 31 en route to a double century in the first Test, fired one into the New Zealand captain’s ribs and found the glove, only for Pope to snatch at a seemingly regulation ing catch down leg.Pope was only behind the stumps in this second Test due to Jos Buttler’s back injury and though he has been a wicketkeeper since school days, his lack of first-class experience – and thus a fully honed technique – means his back-up status on tour is one that England will likely park come their next series in South Africa.Williamson’s next reprieve probably came too late for the sporting blooper DVDs on sale this Christmas but it was quite something. Jofra Archer, trying anything to take just a third wicket in the series, had sent down a knuckle-ball with no-front arm in delivery that fooled Williamson and plopped a simple catch to short mid-wicket.But while Archer was celebrating this apparent breakthrough with a scream, Joe Denly was looking down at the ball on the grass in front of him. Somehow, despite it being an easier chance than most warm-up drills before the start of play, he had fumbled at knee-height and no one in the ground could quite believe it.Williamson and Taylor will probably rank these centuries way down the list when they recall their achievements in years to come (notwithstanding the latter passing 7,000 Test runs). For the sparse crowd that pitched up on the final day, the “I was there” moment probably came courtesy of Denly’s butter fingers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d725d09aaa381b5e6f804c54bc5070bbf840be1/0_167_3754_2252/master/3754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b547dc96cf336aec0258696e3f201e8c","title":"elon musk defamation trial begins in case brought by british diver","story":"LA court to hear Vernon Unsworth’s lawsuit over comments after Thai cave rescueIt was a gripping tale of peril and prowess that captivated the world for more than two tense weeks in the summer of 2018. Twelve boys and their football coach were lost in a subterranean maze in the Tham Luong caves in Thailand. An international team of cave ers raced to rescue them before monsoon rains were due to flood the caves. The story was destined to be fodder for a Hollywood blockbuster – and that was before an eccentric billionaire got involved.On Tuesday, a postscript to the feelgood tale of the Tham Luang cave rescue will play out in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles, California, as the trial begins in a defamation case brought by the British er Vernon Unsworth against Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk.Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first ers to reach the scene of the boys’ disappearance. He was credited by rescuers for his detailed knowledge of the cave system, which helped locate the missing team.Musk had also attempted to assist with the rescue the chief of Tesla and SpaceX assigned a team of engineers to design a miniature submarine that he hoped could be used to guide the boys through underwater tunnels. Although Musk delivered the submarine to the rescue site, the boys were rescued by ers, one of whom died during the operation.Unsworth drew the ire of Musk following the rescue when he gave a brief interview to CNN and ridiculed his submarine, which he said “had absolutely no chance of working”. He added that Musk should “stick his submarine where it hurts”.The billionaire entrepreneur lashed out at Unsworth on Twitter, where he called the caver a “pedo guy” to his 22 million followers. Under intense criticism from the public and his company’s investors, Musk apologised and deleted the tweets, but he subsequently revived the baseless allegations in another series of tweets about a month later. Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a “child rapist” in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.Tuesday’s trial follows a year of legal wrangling between Unsworth and Musk’s attorneys. Musk had attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing at one point that “pedo guy” is a common insult in his home country of South Africa and was not intended as an actual accusation of pedophilia. Court filings revealed that Musk had also hired a private investigator to attempt to substantiate his allegations against Unsworth.The US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled in November that Unsworth was not a public figure, lowering the bar for the cave explorer to prove that Musk had defamed him.The trial will start after jury selection on Tuesday. Potential jurors will be asked whether they hold strong opinions on billionaires who visit Thailand, Reuters reported. Once a panel of jurors is selected, Musk is expected to be the first witness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22ea600a9c5a5da1fc0947f2da17793e2e986f/0_630_3288_1972/master/3288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abd6becfdbf6c0607b18870de42788c","title":"the big picture gideon mendel south africa","story":"In 1990, when the photographer Gideon Mendel left his native South Africa for London, he deposited a number of boxes in his friend’s garage in Johannesburg for safekeeping. These boxes contained, among other things, negatives and transparencies from Mendel’s harrowing first few years as a photojournalist during the struggle against apartheid in the mid-80s.Over the next three decades, Mendel became renowned for his intimate, socially engaged photography, documenting the effects of the HIVAids crisis and climate breakdown. For one project, from his Drowning World series, he has gathered nearly 2,000 water-damaged family photographs picked up on his journeys through flooded communities in the US, India and elsewhere.In this image, taken at a mass funeral in Duduza township outside Johannesburg in 1985, the damage forms a frame within a frame, cropping the image to highlight the protester. The effect is “amazing”, says Mendel, even if the context was sobering: the young activists being buried were killed when an undercover agent gave eight people booby-trapped hand-grenades, which exploded when the pins were pulled. Funerals such as this often led to further outbreaks of violence, and more funerals.“The original images have an almost radioactive energy from that period they carry all the weight of history,” says Mendel. “And then you have this new layer, the effects of water and time and mould on the images” – they speak to Mendel of the deterioration of memory, and the fading of hope in post-apartheid South Africa – “which creates a much more complex and nuanced statement than the photograph can make on its own. It takes the image into a whole new dimension.”Freedom Or Death by Gideon Mendel is published by GOST (£35)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78f852606d8e83fe9d6c95e2465071864cadcc0/115_2_1514_908/master/1514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74441114544a280496dad9f6fb2e3748","title":"10 great travel book gifts christmas 2019","story":"Give a glimpse of exotic lands or immersion in little-known places and cultures nearer home with a book suggested by booksellers around the UKIt’s not entirely a travelogue nor is it a memoir. Rather, it’s the point where the two intersect, and that for me is the essence of enlightening travel. How exactly does meeting new people and seeing new places affect you, change your attitudes and increase your self-knowledge? Sometimes it’s faraway and exotic travel (in New Zealand: “it fascinated me that people had Antarctica as a word in their ordinary, everyday lexicon.”) and sometimes it’s time spent for work in a city nearer home. Boland is an observant and thoughtful traveller, who is also grateful for and aware of what her own “home roots” have given her.Over several years as an enthusiastic amateur traveller, I’ve tried to keep a journal of experiences and journeys. Boland’s determination to write diaries and notes, instead of taking hundreds of photographs, resonates with me. Do I ever look back at old holiday photos? Rarely. But I get pleasure from re-reading my own notebooks. I’d say to anyone who likes to travel, please read this book and start “noticing” your own journeys – even if you can’t be persuaded to put down your phone and write notes!Chosen by Linda Murray, owner, Books Paper Scissors, BelfastThis beautiful memoir really got under my skin. At 26, Brown is studying for an MA in the US and thinks her career path is mapped out – until chance brings drystone waller “Jack” from Wales to Washington DC. Fascinated by his craft, she accepts an invitation to visit his home in Wales. Mere months later, she is working alongside him. Delighting in the physicality of the job and the shifting beauty of the Welsh countryside, Brown discovers that she doesn’t need to be on native soil to feel a sense of homecoming. She deftly sketches the local topography by listing the gear changes required to navigate its valleys, revels in the local language and discovers the joy of elevenses. Her quest to build a life from her craft takes her to Italy, North Carolina, Virginia’s Blue Ridge mountains, and back to rural Wales. Her evocation of place is pitch-perfect, from mist-shrouded hillsides to the “gorgeous throb” of the thick summer air of North Carolina. This is a tale of finding harmony between body and soul, between the heft of stone, the inspiration of good friends and the joy of travel.Jenny Tattersall, bookseller, Cogito Books, HexhamJostling to the front of a rather crowded pack of recent nature writers, Fiennes’ 2017 Oak and Ash and Thorn was justly revered for its lyrical prose and literary bedrock. Honing his easy-going and often witty style in this new book, Fiennes takes us on journeys of writers from 12th-century cleric Giraldus Cambrensis to Beryl Bainbridge, by way of Enid Blyton and Charles Dickens.Though literary travelogues aren’t a wholly novel genre, there’s an infectious enthusiasm and self-deprecating authority to Fiennes’s insights and he’s a most agreeable companion. Recounting a visit to a Welsh barber, he talks of “my scalp being kneaded and delicately teased by an early middle-aged, handsomely coiffed blond man from Neath”. Likewise, there’s a neat line about the invention of the footnote, in a footnote. There will be many nature titles vying for a place on Christmas lists this year, and no doubt a cornucopia of literary anthologies and travelogues to boot. This one should be towards the top.Tim Batcup, owner, Cover to Cover,  Mumbles, SwanseaIn the 1930s, Germany was the most popular tourist destination in Europe. Yet few travel books were written about it at the time. Julia Boyd has tracked down those accounts and, together with descriptions from private letters and diaries and from public archives, produced a fresh view of between- the-wars Germany. This is land of friendly people, beautiful countryside, vineyards, forests, medieval villages and impressive culture. A female journalist notes how a woman could do what she liked in Weimar Germany. A New Zealand Rhodes Scholar writes of “the emergence of a new type of person, sunburnt, wearing sensible clothes and of splendid physique”. Other accounts, especially those from journalists, politicians and diplomats, convey a sense of unease, of menace. Chilling stuff. This book will earn a permanent place on people’s bookshelves, rather than being shipped out to a charity shop to make room for next year’s batch. The hardback, already out of print, is becoming scarce with secondhand copies for sale on Amazon at almost twice the original price.Evelyn Westwood, co-owner, Westwood Books, Sedbergh, CumbriaThe first thing to say, and this is important in the book world, is that it has a terrific cover. The second is that old classic of it just being “a good read”. Bunting writes evocatively about the Hebrides and, for the most part, gets the details and description right. The best thing about it is that it made me want to revisit the islands I know, as well as visit the ones I haven’t been to yet. The book has a lovely balance of autobiography, literary references, history, politics, religion and culture. I opened the shop in September 2018 – this is my retirement project – and though we don’t carry many new books (we focus on secondhand), I’ve had to restock this a number of times because it’s so popular.Ruth Anderson, owner, Well-Read Books of Wigtown, Dumfries and GallowayMy favourite travel book is As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie Lee. It’s beautifully written and filled with adventure and hope, though Robert Louis Stevenson’s Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes is also high on my list. His language is surprisingly modern for a Victorian and we discover he invented the sleeping bag! I know a lot of the travel writing stuff I like is rather old, so how about, for gift-giving, Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Not Visited and Never Will by Judith Schalansky. It’s a gorgeous wee book and the perfect thing to browse through in a spare hour.Tom Hodges, owner, Typewronger Books, EdinburghThis is a collection of musings, poems and illustrations from a wide range of women worldwide, all of whom share a great passion for the outdoors, adventure and the wild. Their pieces will transport you on incredible journeys from the majesty of the Cairngorms through to the glacial domes of southern Chile, from capturing underwater photographs in Fiji to shivering through a blizzard in Canada’s Baffin Island. These amazing, intrepid women have captured the beauties of our world through their pens, brushes and lenses. The elegantly designed book includes both colour and black-and-white artwork to accompany the text. Enlightening and hugely inspirational, this is a book to treasure.Cate Simmons, bookseller, News from Nowhere, LiverpoolGhostland: In Search of a Haunted Country, by Edward ParnellWilliam Collins, £9.99After a family tragedy, this author turned for comfort to British literature, particularly literature that involved ghost stories. This inspired him to travel to haunted places mentioned in stories and, in turn, be inspired by them. Ruins, fens, seaside, forests and waters all have mysteries and ghosts. Folklore and natural history come to life as Parnell travels the country in search of the mystery, loneliness and strangeness the British countryside has to offer – if you know where to look. This is a wonderfully evocative book, creating a sense of place and invoking the power of literature and nature.Adam, bookseller, Hewson Books at The Kew Bookshop, KewMichael Poliza’s new book is, for me, this year’s outstanding travel book. Four hundred pages of beautifully detailed photography are an eloquent answer to the notion that the coffee-table book has no place in an Instagram world. The book is physically huge, and the photography – of landscapes, people and animals – is so good that the effect is truly immersive. The sense is always of a traveller making personal discoveries – a beach where swimmers share the pristine water with sharks, or a stunning azure ice cave. Manmade vistas and patterns attract Poliza too - in his hands a car park becomes a beautiful pattern, and a ring of Vietnamese fishing boats exquisite. Poliza, who made his name photographing Africa, has created a dazzling testament to a disappearing world.

Is this imitation robbing us of distinctive modes of storytelling?Two lines of questioning have bubbled up around the promotional campaign for The Irishman. The first is: “Is Netflix destroying cinema?” and the second, thanks to an offhand mid-interview remark by the film’s director Martin Scorsese that refuses to go away, is: “Is Marvel destroying cinema?” The answer to both, of course, is yes. But Netflix and Marvel are not destroying cinema due to a reduction in theatrical screenings or a lack of artistry or anything like that. They are destroying cinema because they both really, really want to be television.The Irishman, for example, is three-and-a-half hours long. That’s far longer than any sensible person is willing to endure in a cinema, with the cramped legroom and the peripheral texters and the inevitable mid-point toilet shuffle. But watch it in the comfort of your own home and it immediately becomes much more desirable. Not least because, for those of us who only have a limited time each day when their living rooms aren’t being dominated by Paw Patrol, its epic decades-ning story of a truck driver-turned-hitman-turned-shady union rep is episodic enough to be watched in chunks. The Irishman is a miniseries disguised as a film.And if The Irishman is a miniseries, then the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a soap opera. With its dozens of characters, method of storytelling that explicitly relies on the viewer having seen all the previous instalments and franchise plan that intends to keep rolling out in perpetuity until everyone gets bored, the MCU is Hollyoaks with more money and marginally less silly hair.But here’s the thing. They aren’t alone. Everything wants to be television at the moment. The biggest video game in the world right now is Fortnite, which is structured identically to a television series. Where previous video games – Grand Theft Auto, Halo, Assassin’s Creed – would come out in distinct instalments that had to be inidually purchased, Fortnite self-consciously ides itself into seasons, each of which culminates in a climactic cliffhanger ending designed to whip users into a frenzy of excitement. And it works. When Fortnite’s entire landscape got sucked into a black hole without warning a few weeks ago, for example, it was hard not to see it as the game’s “Who shot JR?” moment a 21st-century execution of a very 20th-century TV trick.Most other mediums are at it, too. Podcasting – especially Serial-style true-crime podcasts – increasingly crosses the lines into television. Not that many years ago, a podcast was the sound of two people with identical voices talking about the same thing with barely any structure. But now they tell self-contained stories that pitch and lurch like episodic thrillers. This year’s The Missing Cryptoqueen is a perfect example a true-crime documentary series that unfolds like a prestige thriller. Move in the right circles and it is this, rather than something like Line of Duty, that people will discuss at watercoolers.YouTube is becoming TV, too, as personalities get bigger and formats lock into place in the hope of breaking into traditional media. Hot Ones, a channel where celebrities subject themselves to impossibly spicy food on purpose, is becoming a gameshow. Even newspapers are becoming television, thanks to Amazon’s adaptation of the New York Times column Modern Love. I can’t say this for sure, but I’d imagine that there isn’t a publication in the world that isn’t trying to pitch a long-running column to a TV network right now. Might there be a How I Spend It series soon? A 3am Girls series? A Rod Liddle Moans at Things He Cannot Understand series? You’d be silly to bet against it.So everything is television. And that isn’t ideal, because the gradual amassment of all culture into a vaguely TV-shaped blob robs us of distinctive modes of storytelling. And especially in the case of cinema, this trend is creating a sense of brand loyalty that can actively diminish our enjoyment of original ideas. The eight top-grossing movies of the year are either sequels, remakes or origin stories. Disney is responsible for the top six, and three of those are Marvel properties. Smaller films – films that are films rather than another superhero stepping-stone on a path to nowhere – are being pushed aside.But you know where they’re being pushed to? Television. Either literally (Netflix has released around 60 original films this year alone, including a clutch of absolute belters) or in terms of talent migration. The best writers are working in television now, as are the biggest actors, and they are making work more challenging than many of the big movie studios.This is not necessarily a bad thing. All the other mediums want to be television, but that’s only because television is the best. Television, more than any of its competitors, is a companion. If you watch something week after week, you build a relationship with the characters. It’s deeper and more personal than just going to the cinema. Everything wants to be television, and television should take it as a compliment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90936f8c009dd6df049bb669283951a625b2e781/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf76b07efa38653715f7279b6940b999","title":"he made a fortune from his trademarked bikram yoga but now his empire is in tatters","story":"A new documentary chronicles Bikram Choudhury’s downfall after allegations of rape and sexual assaultLike many communities, yoga is grappling with its own #MeToo reckoning. There’s the issue of consent and hands-on adjustments in class as well as more straightforward examples of abuses of power and violence.But has there been a bigger fall from grace than that of Bikram Choudhury? From his base in Los Angeles, Choudhury made a fortune from a trademarked yoga routine, only to have his empire in tatters following multiple civil suits and allegations of rape and sexual assault.And in common with the stories of the girls in the Jeffrey Epstein case, there is also the depressing state of the Californian legal system that is not fleet-footed or motivated enough to bring sexual predators to justice.The rise and fall (and maybe rise again?) of Choudhury is rich material, and the Australian film-maker Eva Orner (Taxi to the Dark Side, Chasing Asylum) uses it well in Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator. She makes excellent use of the copious amounts of footage of Choudhury from his early days in India to now, aged in his mid-70s. Complementing this trove, Orner was able to access and interview people from Choudhury’s inner circle and several of his accusers.Choudhury was sued by former students alleging sexual assault and discrimination against racial and sexual minorities. In 2017 a court awarded $6.8m to his former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Boden, but she was unable to recover damages as he had fled the country. Bikram has denied the allegations.But the documentary is at its most intriguing when it looks at what the allegations against Choudhury did to the community. Some of those supporting accusers were ostracised, others struggled to break their loyalty to him and the yoga that was now a core part of their identity.In the early 2000s I met Choudhury. I was a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and he was opening his first studio in Australia. As part of the story, I went to one of the early classes and was shocked. What the hell was this practice? The yoga took place in a room heated to around 41C. It was packed and it stunk. There were mirrors everywhere and the room was carpeted, which absorbed the stench and the sweat.This won’t take off, I thought.Later that day I had an audience with him. He was staying in an apartment with panoramic views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. An entourage sat around him, literally at his feet. The vibe was fawning. When I spoke to some members of his entourage, they discussed him with a degree of reverence usually reserved for a religious figure or guru, not the founder of an LA-based yoga school. Then there was Choudhury himself. I didn’t mind that he was a braggart – name-dropping Hollywood celebrities who had done his yoga, boasting about his wealth. After all, he had a product to promote and that is what he was doing. I did object however when, without warning, he looked me up and down and declared that I was overweight and needed to do his yoga.What an unpleasant man, I thought as I returned to the office.Despite the bragging and the insults, his yoga was a great success. At the height of his powers there were around 650 Bikram studios around the world.Bikram yoga came along at just the right time, when wellness became a multitrillion-dollar industry.Yoga was a key plank in the industry, promising not just to make you look good, but also feel as if you’d tapped into an ancient eastern tradition. It was more than just an exercise – it promised community and a way of life.It turns out, the odd dynamic that I experienced that day in Sydney was Choudhury’s usual MO and in many ways was the key to both his success and his downfall.In the documentary he is seen abusing people, calling one woman a “bitch” and “chicken shit”. He mocked another student for being overweight.But there was also a docility about his students – answering to his beck and call and unwilling to challenge him.This is in part connected to the money side of things. People’s livelihoods depended on his yoga: they ran Bikram studios they were franchisees they spent thousands of dollars on their studios and training.Much of the documentary’s early, pivotal moments are set during Choudhury’s nine-week teacher training course – an intense yoga gulag where specifically chosen yogis (giving the training a cult-like vibe) are taught the Bikram method. According to one of those interviewed, “You’re starving hungry, you’re sleep-deprived, this yoga just wipes you out – then you’re ripe for whatever it needs to be entered into next.”This documentary is an important addition to the chronicling of the #MeToo movement, but it also shows how much is yet to be achieved.• Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator is available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ad1be7224bb1ce1700c8381c8935140aae235b/0_251_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06532924c91889b104fe0f30017750f2","title":"turkey denies blackmailing nato over baltics defence plan","story":"Turkish leader blocks Nato military plan, unless he gains support for fight against KurdsTurkey has rejected claims it is blackmailing Nato by blocking a military plan for the Baltics and Poland unless it receives support for its effort to defeat Syrian Kurd forces on its borders.The Turkish government made the claims ahead of what may prove to be a bruising meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and major European powers in Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon.Turkey claimed it had full veto rights for any proposal within Nato.“Nato is an institution where Turkey has full veto rights, politically and militarily, and there are procedures here,” Turkish government officials said. “There is no such thing as Turkey blackmailing – a statement like that is unacceptable.”Erdoğan has blocked a defence plan for Poland and the Baltic states until Nato recognises that the Syrian Kurdish YPG are a terrorist threat that must be addressed. Ahead of his departure from Ankara, Erdoğan reiterated the Turkish position, telling reporters: “If our friends at Nato do not recognise as terrorist organisations those we consider terrorist organisations ... we will stand against any step that will be taken there.”At the four-way meeting with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, Erdoğan will demand Europe endorses his plan for a “safe zone” and will also seek a EU donation for the reconstruction of northern Syria.He will also complain that Nato allies have left Turkey alone in its fight against terror, particularly against the YPG. The meeting is a precursor to a wider Nato leaders meeting on Wednesday that could see isions exposed across a wider front.Macron is angry both at the Turkish decision to invade Syria, and the manner in which the decision was taken in consultation with only one Nato ally, the US. Macron warned it will create a humanitarian disaster, undermine the YPG’s leading role in suppressing Isis and complicate efforts to secure a peace settlement across Syria.Britain and Germany are both critical of Turkish actions, but believe it would be a major strategic blunder if the criticism caused Turkey to desert Nato, and instead move to further cement its fledgling alliance with Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump, who endorsed Erdoğan’s decision to invade northern Syria on 6 October, is not due to attend the Downing Street meeting.On Monday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper urged Turkey to stop holding up support for the military plan. Esper warned Ankara that “not everybody sees the threats that they see” and added he would not support labelling the YPG as terrorists to break the impasse. “The message to Turkey ... is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can’t be held up by their own particular concerns,” he said as he flew to London.“Alliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues – the bigger issue being the readiness of the (Nato) alliance. And not everybody’s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.”Trump has a separate dispute with Erdoğan over Turkey’s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system. Trump has warned it may make it impossible for the US to supply F-35 stealth fighters since the Russian provision of air defences to Turkey may enable Russia to learn about the F-35 operational methods.Turkey says it can keep the S-400 technically apart from the Nato systems, and can limit its radar range.Erdoğan has defied US warnings by activating the system and then saying only technicalities were holding back further orders from Moscow.Turkey says its incursion into north-east Syria is designed to set up a safe zone that weakens the YPG, a faction that it claims is umbilically linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that it has been fighting for decades. Trump’s decision to give Erdoğan the green light has been seen by the US military and Republican senators alike as a policy disaster that has weakened the US’s reputation for standing alongside allies such as the Syrian Kurds.In a fresh sign of the chaos being caused by the invasion, nine civilians – most of them children – lost their lives, and 10 others were wounded on Monday in an attack by Turkish artillery against the town of Tel Rifaat, south of the Turkish border. As many as 230,000 people were displaced by the initial Turkish invasion, but many have now returned to their homes.Turkey plans to establish a 20-mile-deep safe zone along a 75-mile stretch of the border, while on the east and west of the safe zone Turkish and Russian forces will conduct joint patrols. Turkey is holding back from expanding its safe zone partly due to agreements struck with Russia and the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41ef95501380701f5719f04abf26f72d6894e43a/111_134_2876_1726/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dae696cebbd13db361b974f0ef64218f","title":"north koreas kim jong un opens new city and socialist utopia of samjiyon","story":"Site near sacred Mount Paektu has a ski resort and can house 4,000 familiesNorth Korea has celebrated the completion of leader Kim Jong-un’s signature construction project, a new city near the sacred mountain where his family claims its roots, with state media on Tuesday calling it the “epitome of modern civilisation”.A massive celebration involving fireworks was held at the city near Mount Paektu on Monday, the official KCNA news agency said. Newspaper the Rodong Sinmun, a mouthpiece for the ruling party, ran photos showing Kim smiling as he cut a ribbon at the ceremony, and buildings covered in snow.The city, named Samjiyon, is envisaged as a “socialist utopia” with new apartments, hotels, a ski resort and commercial, cultural and medical facilities, it reported.KCNA said it could accommodate 4,000 families and had 380 blocks of public and industrial buildings ning “hundreds of hectares”.The city is one of the largest economic initiatives Kim has launched as part of his drive for a self-reliant economy, but its construction was delayed, chiefly by shortages in construction materials and labour as a result of international sanctions imposed to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear programme.On Tuesday Pyongyang warned again that its year-end deadline for the US to change its “hostile policies” was approaching and said it was up to Washington to decide what “Christmas gift” comes at the end of the year.Ri Thae Song, North Korea’s vice minister of foreign affairs in charge of US relations, said Washington’s call for more talks was “nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favour of the political situation and election in the US”, according to state news agency KCNA reported.“The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,” Ri said. “What is left to be done now is the US option and it is entirely up to the US what Christmas gift it will select to get.”The delays in building Samjiyon prompted the Kim regime to mobilise youth labour brigades, which defectors and human rights activists have likened to “slave labour” because they receive no pay, poor food and are forced to work more than 12 hours a day for up to 10 years in return for a better chance of entering a university or joining the all powerful Workers’ party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

Photograph: iStockThe release of the OECD’s Pisa rankings every three years is a revealing moment for twitchy politicians and policy-makers.It’s a two-hour test undertaken by 600,000 students worldwide which is designed to measure a person’s ability to think.It does not measure what students have memorised. Instead, it asks them to solve problems they haven’t seen before, to identify patterns that are not obvious and to make compelling written arguments.In Ireland’s case, there is sharp relief today: the results show our 15-year-olds are among the best in the world at reading and significantly above average for maths and science.In reading literacy, we rank inside the top 10 (8th out of 77 participating jurisdictions).Teenagers in Ireland also rank above average for maths (21st) and science (22nd) compared to other developed countries.StrikingOne striking aspect of the Irish performance is the small proportion of low-achieving pupils compared to other countries.This, say analysts, is likely to be result of a big focus on tackling literacy and numeracy, as well as investment in disadvantaged schools.(Much of this, incidentally, was sparked by alarm bells following Pisa rankings in 2009, which showed a sharp decline in the performance of Irish teenagers.)The variation in performance between schools in Ireland is also lower than many other countries.This is a sign that Irish secondary schools are relatively equitable compared to other developed countries.So far, so good.But there are some worrying signs.The Pisa findings show Ireland has below-average numbers of high-achieving students in science and maths, for example.This slow and incremental decline has been notable since 2012 and suggests that our strongest students are not being “stretched” enough.It also appears to reinforce a trend where students in Ireland often struggle with “higher order” skills.Minister for Education Joe McHugh has suggested that the introduction of the Junior Cycle – with its emphasis on the application of skills and critical thinking – will help with this.Many teachers who are sceptical of Junior Cycle reforms which, they say, are “dumbing down” the system, may baulk at this. Time will tell if he is right.All in all, it is a steady performance by 15-year-olds in Ireland.Rise of ChinaIf the Irish performance is encouraging, it is eclipsed by the inclusion this year of students in a number of Chinese provinces.The extent to which these provinces are outperforming the rest of the world is breath-taking.Pisa figures show 15-year-olds in the four provinces of China that participated in the study – Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang – outperformed by a large margin their peers from all of the other 78 participating education systems in maths and science.In fact, the most disadvantaged 10 per cent of students in these four jurisdictions show better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries.Not only that, but these same disadvantaged students show skills similar to the 10 per cent of most advantaged students in some OECD countries.Analysts point out that these four provinces in eastern China are far from representing China as a whole,However, it is worth noting that the size of each of them compares to that of a typical OECD country, and their combined populations amount to over 180 million.As the authors of the Pisa study note, what makes their achievement even more remarkable is that the level of income of these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average.The quality of their schools today will influence the strength of their economies tomorrow.TechnologyBack in Ireland, there is much to ponder on how to try to catch up with Chinese provinces and other high-performing jurisdictions.In addition to curriculum changes which may help stretch our top students, there is another key area that remains to be properly developed: technology.Despite notions that Ireland is the Silicon Valley of Europe, Pisa results show students in Ireland are less likely than pupils in other developed countries to use digital devices for classwork in school or at home.Principals’ views on the capacity of their schools to enhance teaching and learning through technology are also less favourable than in other developed countries.Many feel that while they have access to devices and broadband, they feel they lack sufficient access to technical support or assistance.Interestingly, the Pisa tests are completed on computer – and less than half of Irish students reported that they had ever completed a test on a device before.By contrast, the top-performing country in Europe – Estonia – has ploughed massive resources into harnessing the power of digital technology and developing an e-curriculum."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4102484.1575356303!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pisa rankings irish teens among the best at reading in developed world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish 15 year olds perform strongly in reading literacy, according to the latest Pisa rankings.Teenagers in Ireland are among the top performers in the world in reading literacy, according to latest international standardised test scores.Irish 15-year-olds also perform above average in science and maths, according to the Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) test results which were conducted last year.However, students in developed parts of China as well as Singapore are streaking ahead of the world and outperforming all other countries in reading, maths and science.Above averageOverall, teenagers in Ireland score highest for reading (8th out of 77 participating countries) and above average for maths (21st) and science (22nd).There are concerns, however, that Ireland has significantly fewer high-achieving students in maths and science compared to other developed countries.This slow and incremental decline has been notable since 2012 and raises questions over whether our most talented students are being challenged enough.On a positive note, Ireland has a very low proportion of low-achieving pupils compared to other countries.This is likely to be result of a big focus on tackling literacy and numeracy in recent years, as well as investment in disadvantaged schools.The variation in performance between schools in Ireland is also lower than many other countries – a sign that Irish secondary schools are relatively equitable compared to other developed countries.In Ireland, the difference between schools in student performance in reading literacy is less than half of what it is, on average, across OECD countries.When broken down by gender, the results show girls in Ireland significantly outperform boys in reading. However, there is no significant gender difference for science and maths.Minister for Education Joe McHugh welcomed the results and said Ireland is in an “envious position” when it comes to reading performance, in particular.While he said our performance in maths and science is relatively stable, he said we can improve further.“I am confident that the changes which the Junior Cycle is bringing will help the development of our students’ critical thinking. It is no longer just about the facts and knowledge that we teach our young people but helping them see how they can put that into use,” he said.SurpriseThe extent to which students in parts of China are outperforming the rest of the world has surprised many.The figures show 15-year-olds in the four provinces of China that participated in the study – Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang – outperformed by a large margin their peers from all of the other 78 participating education systems in maths and science.In fact, the most disadvantaged 10 per cent of students in these four jurisdictions showed better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries.However, analysts point out that these areas are highly developed areas and are likely not reflective of the country as a whole.The Pisa results also examine use of technology among students and show students in Ireland are less likely than pupils in other developed countries to use digital devices for classwork in school or at home.Students reported that it was mainly the teacher who used digital devices in the classroom.Principals’ views on the capacity of their schools to enhance teaching and learning through technology are also less favourable than in other developed countries.While they reported having access to devices and broadband, concerns focused on a lack of sufficient access to technical support or assistance, availability of professional resources teachers’ skill levels.It also shows that students who spend longer online – such as playing games or on social networking sites – on normal school days are more likely to have lower reading achievement levels.WorryingData on student wellbeing has some worrying results, with students in Ireland less likely than those in other developed countries to report being satisfied with their lives.Significantly fewer girls reported being satisfied with their life compared to boys in Ireland.Stress is also a factor, with a number of students in Ireland (23 per cent) reporting that they always feel under pressure from teachers to do well in exams.Students who report feeling under pressure perform better in reading literacy than those say they are never under pressure.In addition, 11 per cent of students report feeling physically unwell thinking about or doing exams. These pupils perform less well, on average, in reading literacy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4102350.1575322533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck 60 more seek out support group after smear test review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAdditional women who contacted the 221+ Patient Support Group on foot of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review are likely to qualify for the same supports that were made available to the original group when the CervicalCheck controversy erupted last year. File photograph: iStockPhotoAnother 60 women have applied to join the support group for those affected by the CervicalCheck controversy after an independent review of their smear tests found abnormalities were missed.The women are among hundreds who have received a “discordant” result from a review of their slides led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in the UK.This means the review – which re-examined the slides of more than 1,000 women who had been tested for the disease under CervicalCheck, were given the all-clear and later developed cancer – produced a result that was different from the original finding by CervicalCheck, with possible implications for the women’s treatment and health outcomes.Mandatory open disclosureAn overview report from RCOG is due to go before Cabinet on Tuesday, after which it will be published. The Government also plans to publish new patient safety legislation after Cabinet, which will provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious incidents in the health services, as well as the licensing of public and private hospitals.The additional women who have contacted the 221+ Patient Support Group on foot of the RCOG review are likely to qualify for the same set of supports that were made available to the original group when the CervicalCheck controversy erupted last year.With up to 30 per cent of the 1,000 slides re-examined in the review producing some form of discordant result, it is likely they will be joined by more women seeking supports as well as access to the tribunal being set up to process claims in private.A significant proportion of the cases examined by RCOG were designated for priority processing, though in some instances this was because the women involved were dead or were already members of the 221+ group.The RCOG review is also expected to say the performance of the CervicalCheck programme is “broadly in line” with that of cervical cancer screening programmes in the UK. It has told Minister for Health Simon Harris the “performance characteristics” of the cervical cancer screening programme – its ability to accurately identify women who have cervical cancer, and those who do not – “appear to be broadly in line with experience in the UK”.The review looked at slides processed from 2008 up to last year and does not relate to the current operations of CervicalCheck, whose governance has been overhauled since last year’s controversy.External notificationsUnder the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill being brought to Cabinet, doctors will have to notify patients and their employers of serious incidents, and the incidents will have to be notified externally to watchdogs such as the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) and the Mental Health Commission. The definition of a serious incident will be made in regulations, rather than the legislation itself.Mandatory open disclosure and the external reporting of incidents will apply equally to the public and private health services. The Bill also includes provisions on clinical audit and extends Hiqa’s remit to private hospitals for the first time.Hospitals will have to disclose all known information about an incident, including the consequences, as well as an apology if appropriate, and what actions have been taken to prevent a recurrence.Mr Harris is also expected to amend the legislation at committee stage to give the Minister effective powers in relation to investigations of patient safety incidents. These have been constrained since a High Court judgment last year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100872.1575146994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"byelections 2019 ff wins two seats sf greens one each","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewly elected Fianna Fál TD  Padraig O’Sullivan and party leader Micheal Martin  at the Cork North Central byelection count centre.Photograph: Provison Sinn Féin’s Mark Ward was declared the winner in Dublin Mid-West in a remarkable result while in Cork North Central Fianna Fáil’s Pádraig O’Sullivan has held Billy Kelleher’s seat in the 10th count.Fianna Fáil candidate Malcolm Byrne took the seat in Wexford.The Green Party’s Joe O’Brien won in Fingal when the result was confirmed shortly before 9pm. The results mean Fine Gael has failed to win a seat and this further reduces the Government’s already flimsy majority on confidence votes in the Dáil.With a confidence vote in the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy due in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, it means that the survival of the Government is now dependent on the votes of independent TDs who have no formal arrangement with Fine Gael Denis Naughten, Noel Grealish, Peter Fitzpatrick and Michael Lowry.The emerging results represent a blow for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who had pinned his hopes on a win in Dublin Mid West, but a stuttering campaign and huge embarrassment in the party about Wexford candidate Verona Murphy’s comments about immigrants meant that these byelections were even harder than usual to win for an incumbent government.Sinn Féin boostBoth the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe sought to play down the results, but there is little doubt that the results are a disappointment for Fine Gael, if not huge surprise for the party.Fianna Fáil gained one seat with its victories in Wexford and in Cork North Central, where the vacancy was created by the election of Mr Kelleher to the European Parliament in May.The Sinn Féin result in Dublin Mid West was built on an energetic local campaign and a strong get-out-the-vote operation yesterday, which confounded the pattern of record low turnouts elsewhere.It provides a much-needed boost for party leader Mary Lou McDonald after poor local and European elections.The other surprise poll-topping performance of the day was by the Green candidate in Fingal, Joe O’Brien.The Greens Dáil ranks have increased by 50 per cent and encouraging the party to believe a Green wave is possible at next year’s general elections.A clearly delighted Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Saturday the votes for the party showed they were the “clear alternative” to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4102394.1575320426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dara murphy set to receive 150 000 salary in europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDara Murphy, then minister of State for Data Protection, in 2017.

Meanwhile, the Dáil committee asked to investigate a complaint about Mr Murphy’s Dáil attendance record will be unable to do so once the Cork North Central deputy resigns his position. Fianna Fáil whip Michael Moynihan wrote to the Dáil Committee on Members’ Interests at the weekend asking it to examine whether or not Mr Murphy breached ethics legislation by claiming full allowances, despite being largely absent from Dáil proceedings over the past two years. The former minister of State has been based in Brussels, where he has had a full-time paid position as the European People’s Party’s director of elections for most of that time. Vote of confidenceDara Murphy is expected to be present for the vote of confidence in Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy in the Dáil on Tuesday. However, under the Ethics in Public Office Act, the committee will not have the power to conduct an investigation, as Dara Murphy will shortly not be a member of the Dáil. The only possibility of an investigation being conducted would involve a more complicated procedure, involving the Standards in Public Office Commission.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar defended Mr Murphy at the weekend. A spokesman said he was not making any other comment on the matter. However, Minister for Communications Richard Bruton said: “I think a lot of questions have surfaced in the media, and I think they do have to be answered. I think it’s important that the Committee on Members’ Interests investigate this and thrash it out: I think people ultimately have to be accountable for what they do.” Mr Murphy has been in Leinster House on 24 sitting days out of 70 in the first nine months of 2019, and 42 of the 104 sitting days during the whole of 2018 – the lowest attendance record by a considerable margin.

He is based in Skerries, and the town now is home to three TDs: Mr O’Brien, Labour’s Brendan Ryan and Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly.‘Double and triple’The other two TDs – Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien and Fine Gael’s Alan Farrell – are based in Malahide. Green Party sources said they wanted to beat Labour in this constituency at the byelection to maintain their momentum on the centre left.Speaking after the count concluded at the National Show Centre in Swords, Mr O’Brien said a lot of work had gone into his victory, but said people are “definitely” “changing their minds” on the climate issue.“We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave,” he said. “I think there’s a bit of a sea change in terms of how people are deciding where to put their votes.”Mr Ryan also said there has been a “change in the last year”.“ There is a green wave of thinking.

The secretary left precise instructions for when you should call her ? tomorrow between 11 am and 12 noonEllen: oh my godI knew about the royal family of Oudh, of course. They were one of the city’s great mysteries. Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shia Muslim royal line.There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4102972.1575361968!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elon musk faces defamation trial over tweet to british diver","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk introduces the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California on November 21, 2019. Photograph:  Frederic J BrownAFPElon Musk is going on trial on Tuesday for his troublesome tweets in a defamation case pitting the billionaire against a British er he allegedly branded a paedophile.The Tesla CEO will be called to testify early in the case in Los Angeles federal court to explain what he meant when he called Vernon Unsworth — who helped rescue youth soccer players trapped underwater in a Thailand cave — “pedo guy” in a Twitter spat more than a year ago.Mr Musk later apologised for lashing out at Mr Unsworth on Twitter after the er belittled Mr Musk’s efforts to build a tiny submarine to save the trapped boys as a “PR stunt”. The tweet, widely interpreted as a reference to a paedophile, was removed by Mr Musk, who disputed that’s what he meant.“‘Pedo guy’ was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,” Musk said in a court declaration. “It is synonymous with ‘creepy old man’ and is used to insult a person’s appearance and demeanour.”Mr Unsworth’s lawyers have laughed off that explanation and said his claim was undercut by a subsequent tweet when he said, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true”, in response to a question about whether he had accused Mr Unsworth of being a paedophile.The lawyers also said he hired private investigators to dig up evidence Mr Unsworth was a child molester, which they never found, according to Mr Unsworth’s lawyers.TwitterThe lawsuit is not the first time Mr Musk’s tweets have landed him in hot water.Mr Musk and Tesla reached a $40 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year on allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. He agreed in the settlement to have future tweets about the company screened.He was forced back into court on accusations he violated that agreement by tweeting a misleading figure about how many cars Tesla would manufacture this year.The SEC sought to hold him in contempt of court, which led to a new agreement imposing tighter controls on Mr Musk’s tweets about the company.The cave drama played out for more than two weeks in the summer of 2018 when the 12 boys — ages 11-16 — and their soccer coach were trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand.Mr Musk and engineers from his SpaceX rocket company custom built a mini-submarine to help with the rescue. The device was heavily publicised but never used.Mr Unsworth, a er and caving expert whose advice was considered crucial in the rescue operation, said the sub would never have fit in the cave’s tight spaces. He told CNN that Mr Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.Mr Musk responded two days later with his series of tweets.Mr Musk claims he wasn’t making a factual statement and no one reading his tweet would take it seriously and interpret it as defamatory.Despite removing the tweets, he later suggested in emails to the news website BuzzFeed that Mr Unsworth was a “child rapist” and had moved to northern Thailand to take “a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time”. He provided no evidence.Mr Unsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress.The defence has resisted efforts to turn over financial records to show Mr Musk’s wealth but has stipulated his net worth exceeds $20 billion (€18.57 billion). – AP"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium

it was his mentor Jack Merritt who was the first to rush to stop him.Friends and colleagues have said that he had found an affinity with the convicted terrorists, and was convinced that he could “guide him to redemption”.But that faith was repaid with violence as Khan slashed out at those who tried to prevent his murderous spree.A detailed account of the first moments of Friday’s London Bridge attack has emerged for the first time along with stories of the incredible acts of heroism of members of the public.Khan had been given special permission by the authorities to travel to the capital unsupervised and had in the morning given a “convincing” talk about his rehabilitation during a workshop at Learning Together’s fifth anniversary event.But the convicted terrorist, who had only been released from prison 11 months earlier, used a break in the afternoon’s proceedings to go into the toilets and tape a fake suicide vest to his body and knives to his hands.At around 1.55pm he emerged into the hallway on the first floor of the Fishmongers Hall and began his attack.Jack Merritt had gone to try and calm Usman Khan down, witnesses say Mr Merritt, 25, who had helped to organise the event, ran out to try and calm him down along with others who had been in the Banqueting Hall of the Grade I listed building, sources told the .Bryonn Bain, an associate professor with the University of California in Los Angeles who spoke at the conference, said that the “brave” Cambridge Graduate “was the first line of defence, he was the first person to confront him”.Lukasz, a worker at the venue had been cleaning glasses in the basement and heard the screams, also ran to help.“He goes towards the trouble, he gets there on the first floor and it is very clear that there’s a bad guy, he’s got two knives in his hand, there’s screaming, there’s chaos,” Toby Williamson, chief executive of the Fishmongers Company, told the BBC as he paid tribute to his staff.Lukasz armed himself with a long stick and “charges towards the bad guy” but hits “something protective”.But he’s buying time and he allows others to escape to move to adjacent rooms and at that point he has about a one minute one on one straight combat,” Mr Williamson said.“This guy Khan then works his way up Lukasz pole slashing with his knife, he takes five wounds to his left side.”Mr Bain said that it “felt like a warzone... it felt like total chaos.Lukasz, who it was announced on Monday will be getting an honour for bravery in his native Poland, started to lose strength but two men from the conference rushed to intervene.One was armed with a fire extinguisher and the other with a narwhal tusk that he had ripped from the wall.“They come and join the fight and it is pretty gruesome and I think the terrorist decided he was outnumbered, he runs though and goes down the main staircase and the next bit of hell is he is at reception and he can\u0027t get out the front door,  Mr Williamson said.Gareth, the doorman is pushing the door shut as good as he can whilst another worker named only as Dawn calls the police. People were trying to keep the door closed and Khan was swinging knives at them, it was said.Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old who had volunteered with Learning Together, a Cambridge University rehabilitation initiative, was also fatally wounded inside the building and at least two others were seriously injured.Finding himself trapped Khan turned to the girls in the cloakroom, Alla and Sandra, and gives them a “hell of a time” before a showdown in the entrance hall with Lukasz “leading the charge”.Mr Williamson said: “Andy the last guy introduced here, our maintenance man, he’s a Ministry of Defence ex-policeman and he’s also a pretty cool customer.“But when the knife goes to his chest and kill or open the door is the choice he pauses for a moment, he’s reluctant to spill all this out onto the pavement when members of public are going to be facing the same problems but he makes exactly the right choice, the door’s opened, out the terrorist falls and the first one after him is Lukasz shouting at everyone to get out of the way, to get back.But members of the public just don’t do that nowadays, they do what they needed to do, they join in and the man with the fire extinguisher, the man with the narwhal tusk, they are all in there.”Footage has emerged of the two men linked to the charity spraying and prodding Khan with the Narwhal tusk before he is tackled to the floor.Some of the have-a-go-heroes were former convicts who were attending the event, it was said. Saskia Jones was killed by Khan inside the Fishmongers Hall Moments later, at 2.02pm police marksmen arrive and after pulling the final member of the public away from Khan he is shot dead.But in his wake he left a trail of devastation, with Mr Bain recognising: “I saw people die. I saw things that I will never be able to unsee.Those who will feel that devastation most keenly are the family and friends of Miss Jones and Mr Merritt, who had dedicated their lives to helping others.David Merritt wrote that his son was “was selfless in his dedication to make things right in every second of his life”.“Jack devoted his energy to the purpose of Learning Together: a pioneering programme to bring students from university and prisons together to share their unique perspectives on justice,” he said.“Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need.”Explained | The legend of the narwhal tuskIt emerged that Khan had shown “an affinity” towards Jack Merritt, the Learning Together course co-ordinator who helped mentor and supervise him.One source at Cambridge said: “We’ve heard that Khan was initially very sceptical about the group that wanted to help him rebuild his life but built up a mutual understanding and respect towards Jack. It wasn’t so much a friendship, but there seems to have been a special bond, a closeness.“Jack was convinced he could guide Khan to redemption, I think he really believed that he could turn his life round. “He even became a case study for the group.“That’s why it’s so galling that Jack was murdered in cold blood by the man who appeared to have bonded with him. “General election 2019: Dominic Raab insists there will be ‘no privatisation’ of NHS as Jeremy Corbyn writes to Donald Trump - latest newsNATO summit: Donald Trump lands in UK ahead of meeting with Queen at Buckingham PalaceNorth Korea promises \u0026#39Christmas gift\u0026#39 for US amid rising tensionsSign up to our exclusive 24-hour pop-up general election night WhatsApp group Conservative party manifesto 2019: summary of key policiesManifesto watch: what have the main parties promised in the 2019 general election?How will the 2019 general election affect Brexit?General election 2019 latest polls: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s lead falls to single digits as voting day loomsWhen is the general election 2019 and when will we know the results? Labour Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesLib Dem manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesBrexit Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policies Plaid Cymru manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesGreen Party manifesto 2019: A summary of key policiesHow to vote in the 2019 general election A guide to postal votes and proxy votes for the 2019 general electionBritain jumps up international Maths rankings following Chinese-style teaching Do decades-old productions keep opera stuck in the past – or keep it alive?Comment: The UN\u0026#39s \u0026#39woke\u0026#39 climate change propaganda is an insult to scienceStranded strike passengers can make claims for hotel costs, South Western Railway confirmsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/02/TELEMMGLPICT000124669946_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"trying reform jihadis straight evelyn waugh","story":"Is it really a good idea to try and rehabilitate criminals like this one? The deaths inside and outside Fishmongers’ Hall last Friday were tragic.

Until now, a device dying\u0026nbsphas meant being unable to tap out and potentially running into a fine, but it will now continue to work for five hours after the battery runs out of charge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut both features are limited to more recent phones. Tapping out without battery requires an iPhone XS or later, and an Apple Watch Series 4 or later Express Transit needs an iPhone 6s or newer.Before the Express Transit mode arrived, iPhone users had to double press a button on their phone and then authenticate the payment with their finger or face. That led to queues at Tube stations as travellers got their devices ready to pay.Now it will work in the same way as a contactless bank card, needing only to be tapped on the reader, as long as the new mode is switched on.​A notification is being sent out to users in the London area making them aware of the feature.The move comes as one in five contactless journeys across TfL are now made using a smart device.It is a step change in the way we think about how to charge people, the notion of having to understand what ticket you need, do I need an Oyster Card, explained Mike Tuckett, head of transformation delivery for TfL.We\u0027re just trying to sweep that away and make it super simple.Other transactions using Apple Pay will still need to be authenticated in the usual way, using Face ID or Touch ID before making a purchase.It\u0027s the first time Express Transit has been enabled in the UK, after countries including China and Japan, as well as a trial in New York.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: “Uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit and the impending general election continue to weigh on the UK manufacturing sector but the build-up to Christmas has brought a much needed boost.“Firms are reporting weaker business activity overall, especially from the domestic UK market, but export orders have increased slightly this quarter, indicating greater confidence from foreign customers about purchasing UK goods as concerns about an end-of-year no-deal Brexit fade.Hard Brexit would ‘slash UK car production by a third’“Manufacturers will hope that the next 12 months will see a return to Westminster focusing on critical issues such as delivering a long term vision for the economy.”Tom Lawton, head of manufacturing at BDO, which helped with the research, added: “Investment levels have slightly improved this quarter following a series of declines since the start of the year.“While this is positive, and possibly a sign that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is less of a short-term worry, firms are still facing an uphill battle.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Citizens of Israel, Japan and South Korea were also not welcome.US Assistant Attorney General John Demers claimed that Mr Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that it could be used to launder money and evade sanctions.Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly travelled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions, Mr Demers said in a statement. By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.”Several high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry have expressed their support for Mr Griffith, including ethereum\u0026nbspfounder Vitalik Buterin, and cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee.Virgil Griffith\u0026nbsparrested for teaching North Korea how to avoid US\u0026nbspsanctions by using cryptocurrency and the blockchain, Mr McAfee tweeted.See what our government has become - a government corrupt at the core, declaring publicly available information a national secret.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell?

Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)“Can I shake your hand, sir?” he asks. “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish gave his time to come and support this charity today, and I think the very least we can do is say thank you for doing that.”Austin, who filmed the incident and uploaded it to Twitter, captioned the video with the message:\u0026nbsp“A man absolutely died on stage.” Reports additionally claimed that one attendee threw a bread roll at Kumar.On Twitter, Kumar laughed off the incident, tweeting: “In my defence, it was only one bread roll and it missed me.” He also posted a 1966 clip of Bob Dylan mocking\u0026nbspnewspaper reports claiming that his latest concert inspired mass walkouts.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Lord’s Taverners for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift’s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey.A pop-punk song!

It’s a noteworthy song simply to point out that Swift, who has faced multiple accusations of “using” her relationships to drag her ex-boyfriends, is more than capable of self-criticism.A Swift classic about star-crossed lovers, inspired by (what else?) Romeo and Juliet. This is a country pop song is a prime example of Swift’s skill as a story teller – one who understands the power of a forbidden romance.720 14) “Out of the Woods”   Swift emulates Bruce Springsteen on this Eighties synth-pop “get in the car and go” epic, which lasts not a second too long and ends so abruptly that it leaves you gasping to catch your breath.Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty ImagesOne of the most underrated songs on Reputation has Swift embracing the role of villain after years of being accused of using men as a songwriting tool, along with the fallout from her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. There’s so much more bite on this track than “Blank Space”, despite the similar themes – here she is merciless upon learning a man has used her name, or spent her money, behind her back. (Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty Images)There’s something very moving about Swift opening her first album with a song that intertwines the old and the new. Nashville is notoriously unkind to female country artists, particularly young ones, so you can’t help but admire a then-16-year-old Swift, who offered a profound respect to one of her biggest inspirations on her debut single.This song is essentially one big, lustful sigh: Swift seems to delight in a secret romance where she “only bought this dress so you could take it off” and quite literally pants with anticipation.Getty Images for TASA tender Sixties-style acoustic ballad that shows Swift experimenting with rhythm and meter in a way that’s impressively bold this far into her career.Dia DipasupilGetty Images for ABAWhile Red signalled Swift’s full-blown transition into pop music, she couldn’t resist putting the odd country twang on songs such as “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, which mocks an ex for being snobbish about his “indie record label that’s much cooler than mine”. The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded “what?” upon being told the guy needs space: “We hadn’t seen each other in a month.”John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it “cheap songwriting” in reference to using their personal lives for material – whatever you think of that, it’s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting – right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: “You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry And never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you’ve run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes ’Cause you burned them out.” Medic!One of Swift’s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on “Delicate”, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you’re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart.(Photo by Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for TIME)The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before that line on the chorus where she sings: “My baby’s fly like a jet stream high above the whole scene loves me like I’m brand new” hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift’s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship – to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a “white colonialist fantasy”.)

He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there’s only one of us telling the truth.”But Prince Andrew told Newsnight that he did not remember the photograph being taken, and said he could not be certain it was his hand on her.He added: “From the investigations that we’ve done, you can’t prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not, because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph.“So it’s very difficult to be able to prove it, but I don’t remember that photograph ever being taken.“I am not one to, as it were, hug, and public displays of affection are not something that I do.“So that’s the best explanation I can give you, and I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There was no waiting in the lines obviously – you were with a prince,” she told Panorama.\u0026nbsp“Andrew asked me what I wanted to drink, you know, and I said, ‘Oh, you know, something from the bar’. He had something clear. I know mine was vodka … and then he asked me to dance.“He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere. I was just like ‘ugh’ – grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they left the club, Ms Giuffre says Ms Maxwell gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick.”\u0026nbspShe said that later that evening, she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The Panorama interview was recorded before the Prince spoke to Newsnight but she has since told the BBC she stands by every word she said.In response to the programme, Buckingham Palace referred to a previous statement saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.”A statement last month said the duke “unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” and “deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure”.The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\u0026nbspis on BBC One at 9pm.Duke of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’ll call time on discrimination in the work place that leaves women vulnerable to harassment and unequal pay.Created with Sketch.General election: Facts and figures Show all 52Created with

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were WRONG. All those Labour toffs thought they could live without all of us thick, ignorant peasants who dared to disobey the establishment and vote for Brexit.Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, who chuckled at seeing the flag of  St George! — was wrong. Sir Keir Starmer, so passionate in his adoration of Brussels, was wrong.Corbyn — a man without a patriotic bone in his withered old carcass — was wrong. Labour’s total contempt for the working class, who they were founded to represent, has them stumbling towards defeat.So Labour are rethinking their General Election strategy.In Leave-voting areas, Labour will get down on their knees and beg the working class to come home.Even an unequivocal Remainer like Ed Miliband is pretending he has always fought for a Brexit deal.No, Ed — you fought to keep us in a single market and a customs union. You fought for a Brexit that was unworthy of the name.You fought for a deal that was worse than staying in the EU.Labour should really stop fibbing to the British people.The modern Labour Party has no love, affection or understanding of the working class. It is the Tories who now represent the values of  the working man and woman — their patriotism, their belief in democracy, their belief in family  and hard work.In working-class communities, Labour are ludicrously flexing their non-existent Leave credentials — which is both bitterly ironic and horribly hypocritical.Ask all the decent Labour MPs who have suffered torrents of abuse from Labour’s online thugs for ­daring to suggest that the Referendum result, and democracy itself, should be respected.Labour are the Remain party who are too pathetically gutless to admit it. But this election is not simply about Brexit.Infinitely more important than our relationship with the European Union is stopping an economically moronic, terrorist sympathiser like Corbyn from getting anywhere near  Downing Street.I have only ever been a member of one political party — Labour.It was the party of my family, my neighbourhood and my class.That party no longer exists.Corbyn and his Marxist muppets have ruined Labour with their sickening Jew-baiting racism, their puerile class war, their total lack of understanding of even basic ­economics.Do not let them ruin the country.Do not believe the lies that they are going to tell you over the next  days.Andyou are working class, never believe for a single second that this pathetic excuse for a ­Labour Party is on your side.Labour have thrown in their lot with privately educated revolutionaries who would rather wave a Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.And it is only now they are starting to regret it.TOSSING back her golden tresses, Charlize Theron wears a gold dress against a golden background in an ad for Dior’s J’Adore perfume – which comes in a golden bottle.It is like being buried in an avalanche of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.And that’s a compliment.And because he wasn’t there, he must also have invented the scene where a young Prince Charles sobs because he has been forced to break up with a hot young Camilla.And far more offensively, Morgan is surely making it all up when he depicts the Queen faking a tear as she witnesses the horror of  Aberfan.All the real-le photos of the Queen visiting the tragic Welsh mining village show her looking shocked  beyond belief.I do not believe she faked a tear for the cameras.I enjoy The Crown but it is only a posh EastEnders.Don’t mistake it for anything resembling  historical truth.WHAT happened to Katie Price’s £million fortune Just guessing here – she spent it.I will leave it to others to analyse Katie’s profligacy with money and just say this in her defence.She has been a loving mother to her children, including her blind, autistic son Harvey, now , who she seems to have raised single-handedly.She is an inspiration to any parents raising a disabled child.  She has confronted the evil bullies who have mocked her son.She has been a passionate campaigner to hold social media s to account and make online abuse a criminal offence.I don’t think there is anyone in the country who has been more willing to stand up to bullies than Katie.And now she is bankrupt, owing £, to her creditors.I suspect she has faced bigger battles than bankruptcy.THE Liberal Democrats thought vowing to immediately cancel Brexit when Jo Swinson becomes Prime Minister would be a vote winner.Whoops! Now the Lib Dems are desperately offering a second Referendum.Whoops again!Because millions of us hope we never see another referendum in our letime.Paul has had more barmaids than the Rovers Return.VICTORIA Beckham’s  fashion empire has lost a jaw-dropping £million over  years.So who is doing Victoria’s financial planning Diane Abbott CLIVE James, who has died at the age of , was always the smartest man in the room.I met him a few times over the years but the Australian journalist, broadcaster and wit was best experienced on the page and on TV. That is when you got the full force of his brain, which was the size of a planet.Clive was also that great rarity – a true intellectual who was a laugh.As a TV critic, he brought his savage wit to bear on the nuttiest nooks and crannies of global television. As a writer, he was funny, wise and often deeply moving.When Princess Diana died, Clive wrote an unforgettable eulogy in the New Yorker magazine. It recalled how he met her, how their friendship grew and how, at their last lunch in Kensington Palace with -year-old Prince Harry present, he realised that he was about to be dropped from Diana’s court.“I never saw her again,” James concluded. “Neither will anyone  now.”I loved Clive because he made great writing look easy and he made me laugh.As recently as one week ago, a magazine asked Clive what was bothering him at the moment.“Imminent personal extinction,” he replied.And it is a mark of Clive James’ genius that I can’t imagine anyone  in the world coming out with that hilariously honest quip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her. She deserves another chance at happiness –  and at  she’s got a lot of le ahead of her.A lot of jokes are made at the expense of Ulrika’s love le and the fact she has had four kids by four men. I can’t help thinking it would be discussed in a dferent wayshe was a man.I KNOW some people are annoyed that Uber will not be granted a new licence to operate in London after repeated safety failures.But I think it’s great news. The reason that the licence hasn’t been granted is because Transport For  London said that the taxi app was not “fit and proper” as a licence holder.I can see the appeal of Uber – but notthe price we are paying is safety.Also, we are lucky enough to live in a country that has the best black cab drivers in the world – who know where they are actually going because they train for up to four years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Mirror investigation has found a dozen connections between the party of government and those who seek to profit from our NHS.They include Boris Johnson ’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, who previously worked for a healthcare firm which might benefit from a £million fund announced by the Government.This raises a question of a potential conflict of interest, as does a donation Health Secretary Matt Hancock received from the owner of a private NHS provider who has given £, to the Tories and has been made a director of NHS Improvement. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “This damning evidence shows beyond a shadow of doubt that the Tories simply don’t believe in the NHS and its future as a public universal free service is at stake. The revolving door between the Tories and the private health industry stinks.” Unison boss Dave Prentis said: “Patients and staff will be shocked to learn of the cosy relationship between senior Conservatives and some of the biggest players in the UK’s private healthcare market. “The NHS needs a government that protects it, instead of one that puts profit ahead of patient care.” Jeremy Corbyn yesterday wrote to the PM urging him to protect the NHS from US firms and demanded an end to NHS privatisation.The letter was sent just hours before US President Donald Trump arrived for a three-day visit.  The Labour leader wrote: “The public need to know all aspects of our health service are genuinely off the table in any UK-US trade talks, and that no part of the NHS or health system will be up for sale.”He added the “threat to the NHS from a future post-Brexit US-UK trade agreement, given the statements made by both US and British officials and politicians, is of profound concern to the public.”  He warned: “The cost of patented drugs in the USA is approximately . times higher than in the UK, and the price of the top  medicines is . times higher than in the UK. Your proposed trade deal with the US clearly threatens to drive up the cost at which our NHS buys drugs.” Mr Corbyn called for trade talks with the US to be shelved until the President agrees to remove “any reference to pharmaceuticals” from a pact.  He also wrote to the US President demanding similar reassurances. It comes after Labour uncovered official documents revealing the NHS is on the table in trade talks with the US. Experts warn the NHS could end up paying an extra £million a week. Last week, the Mirror revealed then-Trade Minister George Hollingbery met a boss of US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly at the firm’s HQ last year.  The dirty dozen . Dominic Cummings Boris Johnson’s chief strategist until recently had previously worked at articial intelligence start-up firm Babylon Health, which is endorsed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. In August, shortly after Mr Johnson entered No, Downing Street and the Department of Health announced a new £million fund to promote the use of AI in the NHS, which Babylon welcomed although funding has not been allocated. The Tories did not respond. . Andrew Lansley Ex-Health Secretary Lord Lansley is a director of his we Sally’s public relations firm Low Associates, which reportedly represents pharmaceutical giants including PG. The job was approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. . Matt Hancock  The Health Secretary received a £, donation from Wol Kolade, the owner of Vanguard Healthcare, which provides mobile surgical theatres. Kolade, who has given £, to the Tories and is a director of NHS Improvement, said the donation was “in a personal capacity”. . Steve Brine The former Health Minister earns £ a day on top of his MP salary working for Remedium Partners, which specialises in recruiting overseas doctors to short-staffed NHS trusts. The job was approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. . Lord O’Shaughnessy  The former Health Minister is on boards of robotic surgery firm Intuitive, urine test firm Healthy.io and Portland Communications, which has a string of healthcare clients. He said he followed advice from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. . Bill Morgan The former special advisor to Lord Lansbury set up lobbying firm Incisive Health. Clients include Virgin Care, which has won £billion of NHS contracts and sued six trusts. Morgan sold his % stake for £.million earlier this year. Incisive did not respond . Baroness Blackwood  The Health Minister in charge of NHS innovation was recently on the board of Push Doctor, which offers video consultations to two million people “in partnership with the NHS”. It charges £ for an online consultation. The Tories did not respond. . John Nash The Tory peer and his we have given £, to the Tories including £, to the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in .

Speaking as Donald Trump touched down in the UK for the NATO summit, Mr Raab told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I can tell you categorically Iaposve never advocated privatisation of the NHS.The aposhealthapos chapter of a book he co-authored in  agreed the current system has benefits, including that the NHS is “relatively cheap”, adding: “A crucial task for any healthcare reform must be to make sure that we don’t endanger this, and introduce a cycle of ever-increasing costs.” However, it went on: “The easiest reforms to implement would be on the supply side of the NHS and would be an extension of recent governments’ work. The current monolith should be broken up. Hospitals should be given their independence, extending the Foundation Hospital model - initially controversial but now almost universally accepted. New non-profit and private operators should be allowed into the service and, indeed, should compete on price. The -page book, co-authored with Kwasi Kwarteng, Chris Skidmore, Priti Patel and Liz Truss, is called aposAfter the Coalitionapos. It attempted to define Conservative values for a time when the party wouldnapost be held back by Lib Dems. The book also hailed the example of Germanyaposs privately-run or not-for-profit hospitals. Across the world, countries with more competition, such as Germany and Switzerland, tend to be more efficient, it said. Two thirds of German hospitals are run privately or not-for-profit. Patient satisfaction is the same in private and public hospitals.  Mr Raab was challenged over the book today by BBC Radio  Today programme presenter Nick Robinson. He told the Foreign Secretary: Itaposs not that long ago, is it, that you were involved in writing a pamphlet which advocated a health service where apostwo thirds of hospitals are run privately or not-for-profitapos. So they [ Labour ] look at you, maybe Donald Trump looks at you, and thinks aposhere is a man who wants a greater role for private bodiesapos.Mr Raab scoffed: Thataposs a ludicrous assertion. Youaposve picked probably a snippet from a pamphlet written a long time ago, but I can tell you categorically Iaposve never advocated privatisation of the NHS.  But Mr Robinson pressed on - pointing out another section of the book which says: “We should continue the current successful reform programme in the NHS, allowing successful hospitals to expand and weaker hospitals to close. “We should take advantage of the extra efficiencies private sector companies can provide.” After being told that, Mr Raab then said: Yes, I co-authored - I think there were five of us in total. But he suggested his remarks were just about coffee shops and florists - despite no mention of them in the  book. Mr Raab said: Look, when you go into your average hospital you see a Costa Coffee there you see a florist there.  Is anyone seriously suggesting that the nurses the doctors the civil servants in the Department of Health should be running those services  Thataposs wholesale dferent from talking about clinical services. Weaposre absolutely clear - the NHS is not going to be privatised. The big expansion of private companies in the NHS took place under the last Labour government when the current shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth was advising on private health companies. Host Mr Robinson told him the remarks were about hospitals - and they had his name on. Despite this Mr Raab insisted the Tories have no plans to privatise the NHS. On trade talks with the US, Mr Raab said:absolutely clear thereaposs going to be no privatisation of the NHS under the Conservativesapos watch or this Prime Ministeraposs watch.

The Labour Party has been slowly narrowing the Conservativesapos lead.At the start of the campaign the Tories were odds-on to win. But the  election saw Labour surge back to cut down a huge Tory lead with days to spare, so strategists believe anything is possible.  also saw the two main parties receive % of all votes. Since then - with Brexit tearing up old loyalties - polls suggest that two-party split has weakened with new battle lines drawn.

Like all schoolboys he also loves to play but there is no space for that – or even to do his homework in peace. He says: “Le in the BB is horrible, it’s worse than being in a real-le horror film. There’s no room to do anything. EvenI’m reading my book, I’m still going to get annoyed by someone. “I’ve been told off by someone for running in the small corridor. You can’t do much, you can’t play much.” The family sleep in one room and share kitchen facilities with the rest of the BB, in Ilford, East London.Will adds: “Sometimes me and Harry fight for the one chair, because we both want to sit at the table. I find it really hard to do my homework.” The brothers are among the soaring number of homeless children across Britain, increasing by one every eight minutes, according to charity Shelter. Some , youngsters will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation, a report by the charity found. Child homelessness is at its highest rate in  years, with  kids losing their homes each day last year. And for the , families with children living in emergency BBs and hostels, conditions are often sub-standard with little privacy, security or space to cook, the report found. Will’s family lost their rented home in a Section  no-fault eviction, which allows landlords to evict tenants without a reason when their fixed-term tenancy ends.Their landlord wanted to sell and thought it would be easier without a family living in the property. But with no time to save and increasingly unaffordable rents, they found themselves without enough cash for a deposit for a new rental home.  The ending of a private tenancy is the reason % of households in England became homeless or threatened with homelessness in the past year. Will says: “We moved here in September and they said we were going to stay for six weeks. “Then they told us we were going to stay for two more, then they told us it will be another week, then another one.” Will adds: “I love to read my book at the end of the day but my brother Harry needs to go to bed and we need to turn off the lights, which means I can’t see the pages. It’s really annoying that I can’t go to sleep in the bed that we share, as I have school and sometimes I am really miserable because I didn’t get a good night’s sleep. And Harry, he doesn’t like being woken up early when he hasn’t had a good night’s sleep. He sometimes falls asleep at school.” The number of children living in temporary accommodation has soared by % in Britain in the past five years. And in England, there are an additional , families with children who are homeless but have sourced their own temporary accommodation.  These families are not included in Shelter’s figures but are also officially without a home. Shelter warned that at current rates a further , children will be made homeless between now and the General Election on December . This will grow to , by Christmas. Chief executive Polly Neate says: “The fact  children become homeless every day is a scandalous figure and a reminder that political promises about tackling homelessness must be turned into action. Day in, day out we see the devastating impact the housing emergency is having on children. “They are being uprooted from friends, living in cold, cramped BBs and going to bed at night scared by the sound of strangers outside.” Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey slammed Tory cuts to housing benefits and the lack of investment. He says: “Rising homelessness is a direct result of decisions made by the Tories: slashing investment in new low-cost homes, refusing to help private renters and making huge cuts to housing benefit and homelessness services. “A Labour Government will end rough sleeping within five years and fix the root causes of rising homelessness with the biggest council and social housing programme since the s, stronger rights for renters and extra funding for homelessness services.” Your vote can help to tackle this disgrace, by Darren Lewis I still remember the times as a child when my dad struggled to find the cash-in-hand work that would keep us going. On those occasions “dinner” would consist of improvised meals, scraped together with the very last contents of the cupboard or fridge. Sometimes it would be even less than that. We lived at a time when, even after the Race Relations Act of , your CV didn’t matteran employer wanted to give a job to someone who didn’t look like you. Taking seconds at school dinner times was commonplace, as you didn’t know how big or small the evening meal would be at home. Four decades on, it is a scandal that thousands of children continue to live this.Channel ’s Dispatches documentary, Britain’s Breadline Kids, proved a harrowing insight into the scale of the problem. The sight of eight-year-old Courtney opening her fridge to find just an empty tomato ketchup bottle was heartbreaking. As was seeing her younger brother in bed with his coat on to keep warm. Delays in the Universal Credit system meant their mum Charlotte had to wait over a month for money after fleeing abuse. And still the Government reckons all ordinary people want is to Get Brexit Done  This is the politics we care about. Parents want to feed their kids without having to negotiate red tape. Girls Courtney’s age should be focused on school and Santa. Our country is going backwards. We need to use our votes to affect change.

Richard Brittain went  miles from his home in Bedford to the Asda store in Fe where Paige Rolland worked in order to smash the teenager over the head with a full bottle of wine.The  Countdown series champion used Facebook to track down the Fe woman, who was  at the time, after she criticised a book that he wrote, The Daily Record reported .Having been released after serving half of his  month sentence, Brittain has contacted his terried victim again - despite being subject to an indefinite non-harassment order. He sent a handwritten note to her home address claiming that nothing was real except their love and that he would love her forever. Brittain also referred to Paige as his Scottish thistle before signing off This page is torn because we are torn without each other.” Paige, who has moved to a secret address for her safety, suffers from severe anxiety, takes medication for her mental health issues and has dropped out of university since the attack. She said: “I live in fear every day he’s going to track me down again. “I want people to know what this man is capable of – and nobody seems able to stop him.  “I was offered victim support at the time but ended up in private therapy. “I just feel the justice system is geared towards the perpetrator and not the victim. It doesn’t take into account the long-term needs of a victim of an unprovoked attack. “He obviously didn’t fear going back to prison or he wouldn’t have gone to such s to track down my home address again. “Prison didn’t change him or rehabilitate him.” Brittain, who was locked up in , sent Paige a private Facebook message following his release. “I dreamed of you last night. Are you going to send me back to prison  he wrote. “Maybe I need it – I’m bored out of my mind.  “How is the nursing degree going  I was quite surprised they revealed such information about you in court. “I was tempted to get a bus ticket to Dundee and come visit you but I thought that might look weird. “Any chance we could just become friends actually  We could keep our communications secret like we did in last night’s dream.” The -year-old later sent a follow up message begging Paige not to tell anyone about the first one. He also penned numerous sick poems about her on his blog, which has since been deleted. One mentions a “Scotch tartan queen”, adding: “In the cereal aisle we made contact with one another.” When Paige, now , received the letter she contacted Police Scotland. Brittain was reported to the procurator fiscal, who decided not to proceed with charges due to the stalker’s mental health.  It’s understood he is in a psychiatric ward in England. Paige said that she could have died have she been hit any harder by Brittain. Despite the brutal nature of the attack and the mental issues she is dealing with, Paige was refused criminal injury compensation because she suffered no long term physical effects following the attack. “What about the mental effects  she added. My le has changed completely. I was going to be a midwe and should be almost qualied now. Instead, I’m fighting a battle every day because of what he did to me. “There needs to be greater emphasis on the mental well-being of victims of crime and support for however long they need it. “I might have coped a lot betterhe hadn’t continued to stalk me after he left prison.” Brittain attacked Paige in October  after she left an online review of a story he had uploaded to the internet. The pair had never met. Prosecutor Harry Findlay told Glasgow Sherf Court during the resultant trial: “The complainer had read some of that material and gave feedback of what she thought to be the merits or otherwise of the book. “The feedback was negative. What followed were comments made by the accused, which give an indication that he was displeased.” Brittain went to the Glenrothes Asda and approached Paige from behind with a bottle of wine, striking her with enough force to leave a gaping wound in her head. Mr Findlay told the court: “She was kneeling down collecting cereal from the bottom shelf of the aisle. “While doing so, the accused approached without warning, any provocation or words and he struck the complainer on the back of the head with the bottle. “One blow. It made contact and the wound bled immediately and she had a moment of unconsciousness. Brittain was also convicted of using Twitter and Instagram to stalk and terrorise another young woman, Ella Durant.She blocked him from her social media accounts. But Ella told how, after moving from London to Glasgow, she spotted Brittain on the city’s Buchanan Street. Two days later, he was waiting for her when she left work. She found a link to a blog called The Benevolent Stalker, which made reference to her.

Bradley Train had his ribs crushed after he left for dead when a car hit his bike then drove over his body last December. The -year-old from Hull was left with a collapsed lung and broken ribs and was hospitalised for five days, then later signed off long-term sick from work. An inquest at Hull Coroneraposs Court heard how the post traumatic distress he suffered in the hit-and-run contributed to his suicide five months later.The driver of the vehicle,Andrei Marginica, , had fled the to France after the crash but was found at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, reports Hull Daily Mail. Bradley was found dead in his home on May , after his family, who had not heard from him in several weeks, alerted police. The dad was described as the le and soul of the party by his devastated family who told the court that he had been a heroin user in the past and had struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues. His ex-we said that the couple met in a club in , had two daughters and married in . They were happy, but their relationship broke down in  when hr started using heroin again.  The accident had led to severe depression and mood swings, according to his ex. After he had missed his daughteraposs birthday party and not replied to texts for at least two weeks, she contacted police who tragically found his body. The inquest was told that after the dad was knocked off his bike in December  and went to hospital for his injuries he was signed off on long term sick and suffered from depression and anxiety.  He was in pain from the accident and became skinny and let his beard and hair grow and said he was worried about money and that it limited him as to where he would go and what he could do and I believed that he was using drugs, the ex-we said. His daughters last saw him on May  and we began to worry about him so contacted the police who found him dead. To try and curb his drug addiction, Mr Train was receiving support from ReNew. He had a long medical history of mental health problems and was on medication for his anxiety and depression.  After the hit-and-run, Mr Train received counselling for the post traumatic stress that he was experiencing. He felt hopeless and socially isolated and was suffering from flashbacks, low mood, anxiety and was struggling to sleep. He was said to be upset at being unable to work. A serious incident report was written by mental health nurse Sandra Brown who determined that nothing more could have been done by the mental health services to prevent Mr Trainaposs death, but said post traumatic stress disorder after the hit-and-run was a big factor in him ending his le. She said: It seems that the core of Mr Trainaposs suicide was down to his post traumatic stress disorder that he struggled to cope with after the road traffic accident and previous trauma that had caused him a great amount of distress.  HM area coroner Rosemary Baxter said that Mr Trainaposs medical cause of death was hanging and gave a conclusion of suicide. The core is the hopelessness that Mr Train felt and his suicide was perpetuated by the post traumatic stress disorder that he suffered after a road traffic accident as well as past traumas, she said. The post traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts were persistent and overcame him. On a balance of probabilities I am satisfied that Brad took his own le and intended to do so, and so I record a conclusion of suicide.

Five women have come forward claiming he witnessed them giving massages at Jeffrey Epsteinaposs homes. A lawyer representing the women who accused Epstein of abuse has claimed the Duke of York witnessed how they gave massages as all five urge him to testy in the US courts. BBC Panorama tonight reported claims that subpoenas had been prepared in all five cases, meaningthe embattled Duke set foot in the US, he could be forced to give witness testimony. The claims aired tonight on the BBCaposs programme entitled aposThe Prince and the Epstein Scandalapos which featured a much-anticipated interview with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts.She claims she had sex with the Duke of York three times when she was . He has denied the accusations and has claimed never to have met her. He made the denials on BBC Newsnight as scrutiny on the royals intensied in the wake of Epsteinaposs death, in an interview widely described as a car-crash. Lawyer David Boies tonight told BBC Panorama that lawyers for the five victims had twice written to the Duke requesting he participate in interviews, as he claimed he has not replied. He told the programme the Duke could have important information about sex trafficking. Mr Boies told Panorama: “One of the things that we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is. He was a frequent visitor.  They ought to submit to an interview. They ought to talk about it”.  The Queenaposs son told Panorama heaposs willing to help with any law enforcement investigationrequired. He has continued to emphatically deny any relationship or association with Ms Giuffre. The Duke also previously cast doubt on a photo that shows him in  at Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwellaposs London townhouse in  with his arm looped around the then-teenager. Ms Giuffre tonight rubbished suggestions the photo was fake, saying it was authentic and had been passed to the FBI years ago. She accused the royal of making ridiculous excuses, including that he didnapost sweat at that time due to his time serving in the Falklands War - claiming he was sweaty during their alleged encounters.  In an at-times tearful interview, Ms Giuffre outlined her claims she had sex with the Duke three times. She told Panorama: “I mean come on Iaposm calling BS [bulls***] on this, because that’s what it is. He knows what happened. I know what happened, and thereaposs only one of us telling the truth, and I know that’s me.” Ms Giuffre also appealed to Brits to support her: “I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being OK.  “This is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked. This is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.” Ms Giuffre also alleged on the programme that Maxwell helped Epstein recruit her and that the pair preyed on her vulnerability when she told them she was a runaway who had been sexually abused from a young age. The FBI is investigating the claims against Maxwell. The BBC said Prince Andrew declined to answer Panorama’s detailed questions. However but in a statement to the programme, Royal Communications said: “The Duke of York unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.

The child was allegedly made to perform sex acts in a churchyard, raped above a shop on a filthy mattress and abused when she tried to refuse their advances. A court heard how the victim was urinated on by one of the five men, all of whom went on trial today. The offences are said to have taken place in and around Telford, Shropshire, and went on for some years. The alleged victim is now an adult, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  Michelle Heeley QC, prosecuting, said: This case involves the sexual exploitation of a young girl, a girl passed around like a piece of meat for the sexual gratication of several young men, some of whom are in the dock. Each of these defendants deny that they in any way abused anyone. The prosecution say, having heard the evidence, you can be sure they did. She was befriended at a time when she was low, by a man called Tanveer Ahmed. Ahmed worked making takeaway deliveries for Perfect Pizza in the town, with jurors told the location was relevant, as the alleged victim claimed she was assaulted above the shop. The jury heard Ahmed was not on trial alongside the other five defendants, having been deported to Pakistan for other unrelated offences. After befriending the young girl, it was alleged Ahmed started forcing her to perform sex acts with other men. Ms Heeley said: One night he drove her to a flat above a shop, he took her into a room where there were three older men, and he told her she had to have sex with these men. She did not want to have sex but she was forced to, she was pushed down on to an old dirty mattress, and raped, said Ms Heeley.  She saw money exchange hands. Sadly for her, this did not happen just once, but on other occasions, when she was spat on and raped - all orchestrated by Tanveer Ahmed. He himself forced her to perform oral sex on him, andshe refused he would call her a slag, slap her and leave her stranded in random areas in Telford. Ahmed continued selling her for sex, including passing her details on to men, the prosecution said. Jurors heard this is how the girl came into contact with the first defendant, Mohammed Ali Sultan, , formerly of Telford. Ali Sultan is facing four charges of indecent assault and one of rape. Jurors were told: Ali Sultan would take her to meet other men, in the same way Tanveer Ahmed had, men would phone her and Ali Sultan and Tanveer Ahmed would make her answer, and do what the men wanted. The abuse took place at a number of locations, including above Perfect Pizza and in a churchyard in Wellington, amongst others. Ali Sultan would verbally abuse her, calling her a sl**, and on occasions slap her, or pull her hair. On a later occasion he allegedly raped her, coercing her into repeatedly meeting up by threatening to tell people at her school what she was doing. Ali Sultan is also charged in connection with a third incident, at the churchyard, when he allegedly became violent after she refused his advances.  The jury of six men and six women were told he already had convictions in both  and  for similar offences against young girls. Another of the alleged victimaposs alleged abusers is -year-old Amjad Hussain, of Telford, who is accused of forcing her to perform oral sex on two separate occasions. A third man, -year-old Shafiq Younas, from Wellington, is accused of orally raping the youngster in the same churchyard in Wellington. Another male, Nazam Akhtar, of Wellington, has been charged with rape, in an incident in which the girl was allegedly driven to a lane in a car along with Ali Sultan, Hussain, and another male.

Ms Giuffre told BBC Panorama: There was a bath and it started there, then it led into the bedroom. It didnapost last very long, the whole entire procedure, it was disgusting. He wasnapost mean or anything but... He got up and he said thanks, and walked out. I sat there in bed, just horried and ashamed and felt dirty and had to get up and go have a shower.

Ken May could be booted out of his childhood home in Gateshead, after the controversial levy meant he fell £, behind on rent payments following the death of his mum.The charge is not levied on pensioners so Ken said he thinks his landlords Gateshead Housing Company are rushing through the eviction process before he starts collecting his pension next month, Chronicle Live reports.He said: Iaposm fighting a legal battle over the bedroom tax, but Iaposm due to reach state pension age in January and the bedroom tax wouldnapost apply any more. The bedroom tax, or “removal of the spare-room subsidy”, removes housing benefits from those who are deemed to have spare rooms. For one spare room a tenant loses % and for two more rooms they lose a quarter of their benefit. Theyaposre trying to evict me before the pension comes in because I could be in the property for the next  years, Ken said. Iaposve had this problem with the bedroom tax for three years and now they are trying to evict me. The housing company dispute his claims saying he is in clear breach of his tenancy agreement and they have made several attempts to help him including a crisis talk last week which he refused to attend. They also claim he has failed to follow their advice to help him keep his tenancy.  Ken, who has lived in the house since , said he has had no power in the property for three years following a dispute with utility companies over his bills. He said: Iaposve lived in this house since I was -months old, my mother died here, and I looked after her when she had cancer. If I get evicted Iaposll be on the streets at Christmas.  A spokeswoman for Gateshead Housing Company added that notice was served on Mr May because he was breaching his tenancy after several home visits and other discussions didnapost resolve things. We have been speaking with Mr May since July  to address the issue. Throughout our contact with Mr May we have tried to resolve the matter by several home visits and other discussions. In a further attempt to avoid legal action we visited Mr May last week to give him another opportunity to work with us, which he declined to do.

Little Courtney had been forced to understand the meaning of money – and how it feels to live without it. Hungry and cold, instead of enjoying a carefree childhood she worried about how her family would survive. She says: “Sometimes we slept in our coats because we couldn’t afford the heating. Mum sometimes didn’t have any dinner so me and my brother could eat ours. Or we would go to the foodbank to get food. “It was scary sometimes because I was worrying about money. It would worry me at school, and I wanted to make it better for my mum.” Mum Charlotte had fled abuse and was housed in a three-bedroom flat in Cambridge – one of the most expensive cities in the UK – with Courtney and her brother Nathaniel James, six. Out of work after being diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, the mum-of-two faced a five-week wait for Universal Credit and says she had to live on just £-a-day child benefit. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror To add insult to injury, she had to find the money to pay bedroom tax – meaning there was little left to feed her young children or keep them warm. Charlotte, , says: “I felt like I was living in third world country, I had so little money. I had to make tough choices between paying to heat the flat, or buying food for the kids. “I’d get down to my last few pence and have nowhere to turn. Sometimes I’d go without food to make sure the kids ate – they always came first. “A lot of people are just one crisis away from living below the breadline. “We were OK before I had to move. The flat in Cambridge had three bedrooms, and I was told my children should be sharing a room, so had to pay an extra £ in bedroom tax. I had to take a loan out to pay for food for Christmas and to pay my rent and bills. I got behind on rent while waiting for my first Universal Credit payment. We had nothing. It was hell.”  That first time at the foodbank, hungry and confused, little Courtney didn’t even know what the place was. She says: “I thought a foodbank is where food came out of a bank – like a hole in the wall where money comes out, but with food in it. It was really weird being there – I didn’t like it. I can’t always get what I want to eat, because Mum doesn’t have that kind of money. But that day I got Pringles and biscuits. I went back there a few times with my mum.” Courtney is one of the . million children growing up in poverty in the UK, where one in three youngsters are living below the breadline. That is are why we are today asking readers to Give Kids a Cracking Christmas as we launch our Christmas appeal for charity Action for Children. Child poverty will surge to a -year highthe Conservatives remain in power, an influential think-tank says. And the country’s biggest foodbank charity, the Trussell Trust, is bracing itself for its busiest December ever, after distributing , emergency food parcels to children last Christmas. Courtney and her family were eventually forced to move to Hull, where Charlotte was able to save more than £-a-month in rent – vital money she needed for food and bills.

At that point heaposs got about one-minute of one-on-one straight combat.apos  The attacker had managed to stab the hero kitchen worker four or five times in the left of his body, but despite being seriously injured, he refused to give up, Mr Williamson said. The battle spilled out in to the main hall, where a conference organised by a University of Cambridge programme called Learning Together was being held.Khan attempted to flee down the main staircase to the front-door when he realised the scale of numbers against him, MailOnline reports.A doorman named Gary rushed to hold the door shut so that another worker, Dawn, could ring the emergency services and hit the alarms.

Zach Andertonaposs aposentire worldapos was motorsport, the hearing was told, following in the footsteps of his family business and having competed in his first race at age four. Born in Arizona, USA, Zach started driving racing cars when he was three and won countless championships before the family moved back to his father Martinaposs native UK in  when Zach was . Settling in Chester with his father and mother Krista, the coroners court at Chester Magistratesapos Court heard Zachaposs ambition was to develop his own race cars.  On the day of his accident on Wednesday, April  this year, Zach and his parents had attended a meeting with the University of Chester at Thornton Science Park to present his business proposal, after which the university had agreed to provide space, support and a grant for his business. It was a aposkey momentapos he and his family had been building up to, with all Zachaposs dreams coming to fruition, Martin told the inquest, and his son had been on a aposhuge highapos that morning. After a celebratory lunch with his parents, Zach ed home to spend a few hours on his racing car simulator, before going to pick up his friend Adam Barnes as the two were planning to visit Adamaposs fatheraposs racing workshop in Clotton, just  minutes away. It was a clear day without a lot of traffic on the roads as the pair headed through Waverton on the A in Zachaposs BMW M, and onto country roads. He had had the car for about six months, drove it regularly and Adam said he had no worries or concerns about Zachaposs driving, having been with him in the car on several other occasions. There had been temporary traffic lights just before they left Waverton and after this Adam recalled the speed they were travelling at had been aposfastapos. Minutes later, the car lost control on Guy Lane, near to the Crocky Trail, colliding first with a hedge and then into a tree - causing both young men to sustain serious injuries. Paramedics arrived on the scene via air ambulance but despite their best efforts, Zach was pronounced dead at Aintree Hospital in Liverpool shortly afterwards.  Adam was able to make a full recovery in the months following the collision.Listing the cause of Zachaposs death as multiple injuries due to a road traffic collision, assistant coroner Dr Janet Napier said she was satisfied there was no contribution to the loss of control of the vehicle caused by other people, cars, illness, weather conditions or intoxication.Forensic collision investigators were unable to specically pinpoint the speed the BMW had been travelling but ascertained it was somewhere between  and mph. The speed limit on Guy Lane is mph. The exact speed is impossible to pinpoint, said Dr Napier. It was established that the caraposs front shock absorbers were leaking, and that the coil spring was broken, allowing free movement of the caraposs body. Expressing her condolences to Zachaposs parents, she added: It canapost be put into words how awful your loss is. I wish you the very best.  Speaking  about their amazing son, Krista described Zach as the kindest person Iaposve ever known. He would do anything for anyone, she said. He put everyone ahead of him. If he knew someone was struggling he would be there for them. He was funny, full of joy, love and kindness and he was goofy - he always had a smile.

Temperatures are expected to plunge to as low as -C overnight in some parts, which could result in travel chaos for road, rail and air travellers. Met Office forecasters have put a yellow warning in place for tonight and early tomorrow over the threat of potentially dangerous aposfreezing fogapos.It reads: “Fog or freezing fog is likely to lead to some travel disruption on Monday night and Tuesday morning.” Weather experts say the condition will result in “slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible” as well as “a chance of delays or cancellations to flights”. This warning is in effect between .am and am on Thursday across parts of the south-east. Air passengers could see y delays to their journeys as airports put cold weather plans in place. The Met Office said: “Fog, snow, ice and crosswinds mean that air traffic controllers have to increase the gap between planes that are landing, reducing the number of aircraft that an airport can manage. “The same weather can make it slower and more dficult for the planes to taxi between runway and terminal building.”  It added: “An aircraft that’s stood overnight in freezing weather will need de-icing before its first flight in the morning. “That’s a fairly big task for one plane but imagine the task at Heathrow on a snowy January morning. “At the same time, there are miles of taxiways and runways to clear.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/SNS-19652080-Dundee-v-Dundee-Utd.jpg ","title":"cammy kerr keen to finish month off on a high at home to queens","story":"Dundee need to go “full throttle” from the first whistle tomorrow to finish off a disappointing November on a high.That’s the view of Dark Blues full-back Cammy Kerr as he and his team-mates prepare for the visit of Queen of the South.Dundee started the month on a high as a home win over Morton made it three successes on the bounce but the two matches since then have ended in disappointing defeats to rivals Dundee United and Inverness.With no more international breaks until spring, this is the time of the year where form can make or break a season.And Kerr is keen to see Dundee head into the Christmas period with a morale-boosting three points against the Doonhamers.He told the Tele: “It’s been a frustrating month, we came into it on the back of a few victories but the last two haven’t been so good in the derby and then away at Inverness.“Again we just need to pick ourselves up – there’s been a lot of that this year where we’ve gone on a wee run, stalled, wee run, stalled.“It’s about getting that consistency, people go on about that all the time but it is important.“This time of the season is a great time to build a bit of momentum.“Looking at the table, ideally we’d want to be higher up, we are in the play-off position but we want to be kicking on.“At this football club, we don’t just settle for being in the mix, we want to push on – that’s something that’s very much in the players’ thoughts.”Dundee’s last match at Dens Park wasn’t one to remember for home fans and full-back Kerr is keen to banish those memories by getting off to a positive start to tomorrow’s Championship clash.He added: “It’s so important to try to get off to a good start, go full throttle from the start.“We need to take the game to teams, especially at Dens.“Not every game works out like that, though people think Dundee should go winning every game.“Everyone here wants to do that but teams set up dferently, they sit in and make things very dficult.“There are a lot of good teams in this league, teams that outsiders maybe write off but they are all very dficult sides.”He added: “The home record this season has been better bar the derby and the Partick defeats.“We want to build this place up and get the fans happy.“We’re just as gutted as them from the derby and last week’s defeat. We’ll keep striving to get up that table.”Kerr and the rest of the Dundee backline were pleasantly surprised this week by theof goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.The former Hearts man is set to make his comeback to the squad tomorrow after almost six weeks out after appendix surgery.“Everyone in the goalkeeping department has been great this season,” Kerr added.“Big Jack Hamilton has been outstanding for us this year and then we had Conor Hazard come in. He had a big jersey to fill with Jack being out ill.“We’ve also got Calum Ferrie who has been unfortunate not to play and what a goalkeeper he is.“A lot of that is down to the work done by Rab Geddes, the goalie coach, who works tirelessly with them.”Heading into the weekend, Dundee trail leaders United by a massive  points, prompting talk of the Tangerines having one hand on the trophy already.Kerr knows the Dark Blues can’t go believing that, however.“We only focus on the games we can win. It would be naive to say United have won the league – we’ll let people think thatthey want but our task is game by game and that starts tomorrow at home to Queens to try to pick up three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/19703913-910x564.jpg ","title":"dundee 1 2 queen of the south dramatic dobbie double adds to dark blue despair","story":"Stephen Dobbie added to Dundee#s woes as the veteran striker#s dramatic brace condemned the Dark Blues to their third defeat on the bounce.It was no less than Queen of the South deserved despite Danny Johnson#s nd-minute leveller seeming like it had earned an unlikely point from another poor performace from the Dens men.Dobbie#s first-half strike looked like it was enough to take the points back to Dumfries only for Johnson to rattle in a fine equaliser.Seconds later, though, Dobbie stole the ball off a dawdling Jordon Forster before chipping in to make it three poor defeats on the bounce for Dundee.For much of the contest, the Dens men struggled to test the visiting goalkeeper as Queen of the South dominated the shot count and moved to within two points of the Dens side.Manager James McPake made four changes to his starting XI as Jack Hamilton made his comeback in goal with Conor Hazard ing to parent club Celtic, Cammy Kerr to right-back with Josh Todd and Fin Robertson back in midfield.Paul McGowan and Josh Meekings missed out entirely after McGowan#s young child took ill on Thursday and Meekings had a back spasm.

We bought the building about four years ago.“If they don’t open it here they would open it somewhere  – but it is nothing to do with me.“I don’t think anyone could consider me the type to run a lapdancing bar – and I don’t think I would get it past my we, either.”When asked the name of the interested operator, Mr Morrison said he could not recall it.Local residents could be set to object to the plans, claiming a lapdancing bar would “bring down” the area.One local flat owner, who declined to give his name, said: “It’s a family kind of area – this would bring it down.“All that nice Waterfront and the money going in, only to have a strip club in the middle.”The timing of the application may also clash with a consultation on limiting sex venues that Dundee City Council pledged to hold by the end of this year.This was made possible by new Scottish Government legislation which will allow councils to set limits on the number of adult clubs in their local area.The application could end up being discussed at the same meeting as the consultation on whether such proposals can go ahead at all.At the moment, Dundee is home to one lapdancing bar – Private Eyes on Rattray Street – but it is not the first time such a proposal has been floated for the Seagate site.In , an application was submitted for the same purpose by businessman Jimmy Marr at the same venue, when it was known as Stars Sports Bar.A spokesman for the bar said at the time that lapdancing clubs were “no longer seedy-like places where dirty old men go”.Despite council officers recommending the plans for approval, elected members voted them down due to concerns of a rise in antisocial behaviour."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/KMil_Tele62-846x564.jpg

with less than two weeks until voters go to the polls, we begin our look at the seven election battlegrounds across the north-east.Aberdeen North is the first constituency to fall under the spotlight, a seat won by the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman in  and held in .In next month’s race, she faces off against five other candidates, with her closest rival likely to be the Scottish Labour Party’s Nurul Hoque Ali.The seat has been shrouded in controversy after the Tories chose to withdraw its support of their candidate Ryan Houghton amid accusations of anti-Semitism and homophobia.The councillor has been suspended by the party and told he would receive no backing in his campaign in the run-up to the election.However, due to election laws, Mr Houghton – who has strongly denied any accusations that he is anti-Semitic or homophobic – will remain as the Conservative candidate on December ’s ballot paper.Ms Blackman was the only SNP MP to hold on to her seat in the north-east in , after the region turned blue.Although she secured % of the vote, receiving , votes, her majority was reduced by more than , compared to .Many say the seat is the SNP’s for the taking but Ms Blackman claims she is “not taking anything for granted at all”.She added: “It is the case that over the last four years I have tried to help as many people as possible and we are hearing that reflected.”The SNP candidate says Brexit is the big issue she’s hearing on doorsteps, along with concerns from voters about Tory austerity.She said: “Some people are particularly worried about Brexit and a number are looking at the absolute mess in Westminster and thinking we can do better than this.“We have had a decade of Tory austerity and the roll-out of Universal Credit. An awful lot of people are impacted by that and just want to see some change.”Scottish Labour candidate Nurul Hoque Ali has positioned himself as being the most likely party to challenge the SNP in the seat, who he claims are “only interested” in pursuing independence.Scottish Conservative candidate Ryan Houghton said he did not wish to comment further on the allegations ahead of the results of a disciplinary  on the matter.But he said his priority in the election was to be someone who would “speak up for Aberdeen”.He added: “We have a lot of challenges in Aberdeen North and I want to improve access to healthcare and local services and stand up for veterans as well.”If voters place their faith in him then he would be elected as a Conservative MP.However, it would then be at the Westminster party’s discretion whether they decide to remove the whip or conduct their own investigation into Mr Houghton’s conduct.The seat is also the only north-east seat being contested by Guy Ingerson of the Scottish Green Party and Seb Leslie of the Brexit Party.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Kimory continued to press and Eilidh Cameron scored shortly after, whilst Euan Gilmour grabbed his second, all within the first  minutes of the first half.Credit to Uddingston who battled back and started creating chances but couldn’t find a way through.The second half was a tight contest, but it was Eilidh Cameron who grabbed her second of the match to make it four nil, which was how it finished.Kilmory will play Ardnamurchan in the development trophy final.The second semi-final saw Bute take on Glasgow Mid Argyll for a place in the U league final.Bute passed the ball freely between their forward line and despite great battles across the pitch found themselves scoring at will.Bute continued to show off their free-flowing shinty, however, great credit has to go to the much younger Glasgow side who played some great shinty.The Bute defence stood firm against any Mid Argyll attacks and kept a clean sheet making the final score - to the islanders.Bute will now face Oban Camanachd in the south final."},{"url":null,"title":"summer reflections brighten the archway","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArgyll artist Lex McFadyen has ed from France to showcase his latest work in an exhibition.Summer Reflections features paintings reflecting the colour and light of Burgundy, where he now has a studio.The opening night of the exhibition at The Archway Gallery, Lochgilphead, on Friday November  was well-attended with the colourful creations catching the eye.Many commented on the brightness of the paintings, with the delicious-looking red cherries a particular talking point.Wilma and Ian Meikle, owners of The Archway Gallery, said: #We are delighted to have Lex back exhibiting with us.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"stars rough start continues with defeat to league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star are still looking for their first points in this season#s Premier One campaign after another disastrous first half saw the Lochgilphead side trail - at half time against table-topping Easthall at the Ropework.The home side steadied the ship in the second half, however, and pulled a consolation goal back through a well placed effort from Lee MacLean # though the damage had been done in a first-half spell where Star shipped five goals in the space of half an hour.On Saturday November , Red Star travel to play Argyll neighbours Dunoon AFC looking to pick up their first win and move themselves off the foot of the table."},{"url":null,"title":"tree shop branches out for christmas craft fair","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Tree Shop at Clachan, Cairndow, is usually buzzing with customers.If not searching for plants, shrubs and trees for the garden they might be looking for that perfect present in the gt shop or enjoying a cake and a cuppa in the tearoom.The annual pre-Christmas craft fair at the Tree Shop saw plenty more people descend on the popular centre, situated beside the A at the head of Loch Fyne.On a gorgeous but chilly autumn day, Tree Shop manager Neil Colburn said: #It#s been really busy, which is great.

So, for the first time, NFUS lodged an official complaint with ASA.The complaint was lodged in early June and the organisation behind the posters responded to the complaint in August but it took a further two months before the verdict.

Itrsquos also a contact point for the council.ldquoThere is also a worry that people arenrsquot going to pop into nearby shops and to use them, itrsquos taking something away from the town centre.ldquoThere is also a big worry in Jedburgh about buildings going out of use. It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

The children will also learn about fire safety to keep humans and animals safe.Meghan, from Dunbar, was awarded a posthumous First Class Honours degree from Edinburgh Napier University, where she was studying veterinary nursing, following her death in December .In a statement, her mum and dad said: ldquoWe remember Meghan talking about meeting Lesley and how excited she was about the prospect of being involved with Fostering Compassion. The workshop is such a lovely way to keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Each Fostering Compassion workshop includes the donation of lsquogts of compassionrsquo from the children to animals in need.Through the Animal Heroes workshops, funds will be raised to donate Smokey Paws oxygen mask kits, used by firefighters to resuscitate animals pulled from fires, to each of the  fire stations in the Lothians, Borders and Fe, which do not yet have them.These gts help encourage compassion and empathy in the children and at the same time, with the blessing of her family, will help keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Miss Winton added: ldquoMeghan was also a firm believer of lsquorandom acts of kindnessrsquo and created the lsquoWishing Treersquo in Pressmennan Woods in East Lothian where she hung inspirational messages full of hope and love.

After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

One of those at risk is Mr Raab, the Brexiter who didnrsquot understand how important Dover is to trade, and the man, too, who said people use foodbanks not because theyrsquore poor but because they have ldquocash-flow problems. The under-currents also make Scottish seats like Mr Blackfordrsquos just as hard to predict.The reason for the unpredictably is a trend in politics that started in earnest in the s but has now reached its apotheosis. In , after a  start in , Labour won the General Election thanks in a large part to tactical voting and itrsquos been a signicant factor in elections ever since. The Tories did well in Scotland in the last General Election, for example, because so many voters chose to vote tactically against the SNP.:SNPrsquos Ian Blackford has a great deal to answer for ndash Lord Menzies CampbellLooking at the polls, this tactical voting trend is going to be even more important this year. According to polling by the Electoral Reform Society,  per cent of voters plan to vote tactically to thwart a candidate they donrsquot like, although itrsquos amazing the figure isnrsquot much higher. Theresa May would have won a majority in just .% of voters had acted dferently, and this time round, the result will come down to a couple of hundred thousand people. If enough of them vote tactically, Boris Johnson wonrsquot get his majority.Over the years, it looks like more and more voters have started to understand this and wersquore now at the point where tactical voting is almost like a political party of its own. It has led to weird sights such as the former Tory minister Michael Heseltine standing behind a LibDem podium and the former Blair PR man Alastair Campbell saying ldquodonrsquot vote Labour! . There are also any number of tactical voting websites that will tell you how to achieve your aim.And it appears to be starting to work. In , Dominic Raab won Esher and Walton with nearly  per cent of the vote andthe national polls were replicated in the seat on December , he would easily win again. However, the current polling in his seat puts the Tories on %, just five per cent ahead of the LibDems. Perhaps Remainers in the constituency who are still wondering whether they should switch should listen to Alastair Campbell: Donrsquot vote Labour!:Harry Dunn: Dominic Raab booed and branded a coward as he leaves hustingsTactical voting is just as important, albeit more complicated, in Scotland, and therersquos evidence that the voters, and the parties, are willing to use it. In recent days ndash much to the amazement and disgust of some ndash support for the Conservatives in Scotland has been rising at the same time itrsquos been falling in England and the explanation has to be that some Unionist voters are choosing the Tories as a tactical vote against the SNP.Therersquos also been evidence of tactical thinking where in Scotland. In Ian Blackfordrsquos seat, for example, therersquos been suspicion that some of the candidates are working to an official pact to maximise voting for the LibDems, and the LibDemsrsquo private polling shows itrsquos having an effect. Some voters may also be unable to resist the chance to take a big SNP scalp in the way they did with Alex Salmond in  .What makes the whole thing much more complicated in Scotland is the way that Brexit and independence intersect. For tactical voting to have any serious effect on the SNP, it requires LibDems and some Labour supporters to switch to the Tories, which many of them did in . But will they be willing to do it again this time, now that the Tories are run by hard Brexiters like Boris Johnson  I suspect a lot of Scottish voters would rather die in a ditch.But the incentive for a big, central group of Scottish voters to behave tactically remains strong. Indeed, the evidence of tactical thinking in Scottish politics underlines a comforting fact about us: there is a still a strong, liberal, progressive, anti-nationalistic centre of voters in Scotland who are just as repulsed by Ian Blackfordrsquos Scottish nationalism as they are by Dominic Raabrsquos British version.If the world was dferent of course, and we were freed of the threats of Brexit and independence , many,not most, of these sensible centrist Scottish voters would support Labour or the LibDems. Certainly, by any realistic, liberal, progressive test, the LibDem manesto wins hands down.However, thatrsquos not the world wersquore stuck with, sadly, which leaves many centrist Scottish voters with an ugly dilemma, especially in seats that will be won either by the Tories or the SNP. Many of the tactical voting guides suggest voting SNP to beat Brexit-supporting Tories, but that misunderstands the subcutaneous trends in modern Scottish politics ndash many Scottish voters do not want Brexit but they do not want independence either. Ideally, they would vote to keep the SNP out of Scottish seats and the Tories out of power at Westminster, but in many constituencies, the system simply does not allow voters to support that option.:SNPs vetting process frustrated by senior MP prior to candidate selectionIn the end, the result of the election will depend on what this group of voters decides to do in Scotland, and what Remainers decide to do in the rest of the UK, but, with Labour support up in England and the Tories up in Scotland, the trend in the polls would seem to suggest that many are already choosing the tactical option. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos pronouncement that a vote for the SNP is a vote for a second Scottish referendum, as well as polls suggesting a Tory majority, may also concentrate the minds of potential tactical voters.And just think of the potential prize on election nightvoters do take the tactical option. .am. Dominic Raab is defeated in Esher and Walton. A little while later, Ian Blackford loses Ross, Skye and Lochaber.

Libraries offered residents a place to shelter from freezing temperatures and leisure centres run by Falkirk Community Trust said anyone could come and use their showers for free.Fourteen Schools and nurseries across the area were closed on Monday, but Falkirk Council said all but three ndashwould reopen on Tuesday. Those still unable to open are Bainsford Primary School and Nursery Class, Kinnaird Primary and Larbert Early Learning Centre.The problem was blamed on the failure of equipment used to manage pressure in the gas network. While engineers repaired this quickly, gas infrastructure company SGN had initially warned turning supplies back on safely could take until Friday or even the weekend. But by Monday evening, supplies were being restored to homes across Bainsford, Carron, Carronshore, Larbert, Langlees, New Carron Village, Skinflats and Stenhousemuir.SGN said the revised timescale was due ldquoincredible efforts from our engineers over the past  hours.Despite this, efforts were continuing to ensure the safety of vulnerable people last night and many residents decamped to stay with relatives or friends rather than remain in unheated homes as temperatures dropped.SGN set up an information point at Camelon Community Centre. The company added: ldquoWersquore still providing electric hotplates and heaters for people with young children, a disability, a long-term mental or physical condition or who are a bit older.Meanwhile the regionrsquos libraries offered those affected a place to spend the day. Falkirk Library Trust tweeted: ldquoFalkirk Libraries are open, warm and free. You can sit in any library for as long as wersquore open-no pressure to do anything. You donrsquot need to be a member... Some libraries have drinks machines,not, bring one in. Bring the kids!The company said engineers needed to visit inidual homes to ensure appliances were safe before they could be reconnected. SGN said in a statement: ldquoOur engineers will be revisiting each affected property to reconnect your gas supply, which involves carrying out safety checks. Itrsquos important you donrsquot try to turn on your gas supply yourself. We have more than , properties to visit and it will take us a couple of days to reach everyone.ldquoWersquore prioritising those most vulnerable members of the community first but wersquoll be making every effort to get gas back on to everyonersquos homes as soon as possible.With many homes relying on electricity,they could, as a substitute fuel, power network company SP Energy Networks said it was concerned about increased demand in the area and engineers were monitoring usage.ldquoElectric heaters and hotplates use a lot more power than their gas equivalents, ldquo the company said. ldquoWith this in mind wersquod ask that everyone in the area thinks smart about using electricity just now ndash heat the rooms yoursquore using, wrap up warm and donrsquot have all your devices turned on at once.The company added: ldquoPlease remember to always check the ID of anyone calling at your home. All our engineers carry photo ID badges, as do other official organisations.Local businesses were also affected. The Malcolm Allan butchers in Larbert had to stop production at the bakery where it makes steak pies after losing its gas supply on Monday morning.

The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amAN exclusion zone has been set up in part of Scapa Flow after the discovery of an unexploded torpedo in an area close to the wreck of HMS Royal Oak.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

The trees that will stand inside and outside the St Magnus Cathedral are from Grimstad and Hordaland, in Norway, respectively.Speaking during an event at the Robert Rendall building in Stromness today Mr Strømmen talked about the visit to Orkney so far — which is a first for him.He said: #There are two things that really stand out when it comes to Orkney — there is the Viking tradition and the fact that Orkney was part of Norway many hundreds of years ago. That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly. I think this is the same for the Icelanders and Swedish.#The Kirkwall Christmas Tree lighting will take place outside St Magnus Cathedral from .pm tomorrow, Saturday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Humans are among the most social animals and are the most intelligent, so it should not have come as a surprise that being cut off from the rest of society can cause distress that is severe enough to affect our health.: New strategy to tackle loneliness launched by Scottish Government: Lonely older people in Glasgow hide feelings to not be a ‘burden’But, four years on from that landmark study, loneliness remains a problem for tens of thousands of Scots, particularly elderly people. According to new research from Age Scotland, one in six of the older generation – that’s about , people – say they often feel more lonely at Christmas than at any other time of year. Nearly , will eat Christmas dinner alone.This is the society we have created and we are the only people who can do something about it. And yet, overshadowed by issues like Brexit, independence, the NHS, schools and a whole raft of other pressing matters, it is too often overlooked in our public discourse.For all these reasons, the Scotsman is today launching a campaign in an attempt to raise the profile of loneliness – in support of Age Scotland and Age UK’s ‘No One Should Have No One’ campaign – and to give a voice to the voiceless.If we think about it, we can all probably do a bit more. We can extend the hand of friendship to relatives and others who we know are lonely. Sometimes it can be dficult or a bit awkward at first, but such feelings will usually dissipate over time. It is not naive to say that the vast majority of people are friendly, decent and kind. Modern living has physically stretched the bonds of family as people have moved hundreds of miles away to find better jobs and this has left many elderly people on their own as family and friends of their own generation have died.But it cannot be beyond our wit to find ways of bringing people togetherthey are feeling isolated and alone.

Yes Kirkcaldy, which was set up before the  referendum, had previously indicated it would back the Scottish Greens candidate’s campaign: SNP withdraws support for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath candidateIn statement, the group said: “We thought Neale Hanvey had dropped out of the race altogether, leaving the Greens’ Scott Rutherford as the only pro-independence candidate.“That turned out not to be the case, and since it became clear that Neale was running as a pro-independence, independent candidate, who still has very strong support, we have come to the conclusion he has the best chance of winning the seat.”A crowdfunding page launched by Mr Hanvey on Saturday to pay for his campaigning costs smashed its target in less than  hours.Speaking today, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw described the decision by some SNP activists to support the party’s axed candidate as “appalling”.Last week, Mr Hanvey admitted to having shared an article from the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik from  concerning the Hungarian financier George Soros, illustrated with an image showing him holding puppets of world leaders.The former Dunfermline councillor made a full apology and later announced his intention to stand as an independent.Yesterday, the SNP’s defence spokesman questioned why some Nationalists were still supporting Mr Hanvey.Responding to one on Twitter who said the antisemitism was a mere allegation, he said: “It’s not ‘alleged antisemitism’, he posted a statement apologising for spreading antisemitism – in this case theories that lead directly to hatred of Jews: comparisons with Nazis and George Soros conspiracies. Why would you swing behind that ”Scott Rutherford, the Greens’ candidate in the seat, said: “I am disappointed that some in Yes Kirkcaldy have ultimately decided that they will not back the only pro-independence party in the constituency at this election. The fact is the SNP suspended Neale Hanvey because of his views. As an inclusive, cross-party movement, independence supporters should be uniting behind the only remaining pro-indy party on the ballot. “The Scottish Greens are already leading on the key issues in this constituency, calling for a just transition at Mossmorran and jobs at BiFab in Burntisland.

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends. Most of them have passed on unfortunately but we do have the present days menrsquos club. We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users. And of course you have a meal here every day and a bit of chat.ldquoIrsquom here every day. Irsquom a service user two days a week a volunteer the other three days. Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours. Itrsquos important for older people to look out for each other.Mabels storyMabel McCracken, who has been coming to Age NI for the past three years, agreed with Robert.ldquoEvery time yoursquore out you should say lsquohellorsquo ndash itrsquos important to be friendly, said the -year-old.Mabel told her story of how she came to be living on her own: ldquoI was a shorthand typist. I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert .

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile ian paisley certain to weather the storm in north antrims staunch dup country","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The whole thing has been going on too long,\" he said.\"Sure the Union itself could be broken before they get out of Europe - Scotland could leave the UK before it leaves the EU.\"And with all the mix-up at Westminster there will be a lot of people who will not come out to vote at all, I think.

The tweet, widely interpreted as a reference to a paedophile, was removed by Mr Musk, who disputed that’s what he meant.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Vernon Unsworth “‘Pedo guy’ was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,” Musk said in a court declaration. “It is synonymous with ‘creepy old man’ and is used to insult a person’s appearance and demeanour.”Mr Unsworth’s lawyers have laughed off that explanation and said his claim was undercut by a subsequent tweet when he said, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true”, in response to a question about whether he had accused Mr Unsworth of being a paedophile.The lawyers also said he hired private investigators to dig up evidence Mr Unsworth was a child molester, which they never found, according to Mr Unsworth’s lawyers.The lawsuit is not the first time Mr Musk’s tweets have landed him in hot water.Mr Musk and Tesla reached a  million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year on allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. He agreed in the settlement to have future tweets about the company screened.He was forced back into court on accusations he violated that agreement by tweeting a misleading figure about how many cars Tesla would manufacture this year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  This is not the first time Mr Musk has been taken to task over comments made on social media The SEC sought to hold him in contempt of court, which led to a new agreement imposing tighter controls on Mr Musk’s tweets about the company.The cave drama played out for more than two weeks in the summer of  when the  boys — ages - — and their soccer coach were trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand.Mr Musk and engineers from his SpaceX rocket company custom built a mini-submarine to help with the rescue. The device was heavily publicised but never used.Mr Unsworth, a er and caving expert whose advice was considered crucial in the rescue operation, said the sub would never have fit in the cave’s tight spaces. He told CNN that Mr Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.Mr Musk responded two days later with his series of tweets.Mr Musk claims he wasn’t making a factual statement and no one reading his tweet would take it seriously and interpret it as defamatory.Despite removing the tweets, he later suggested in emails to the news website BuzzFeed that Mr Unsworth was a “child rapist” and had moved to northern Thailand to take “a child bride who was about  years old at the time”. He provided no evidence.Mr Unsworth is seeking unspecied damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress.The defence has resisted efforts to turn over financial records to show Mr Musk’s wealth but has stipulated his net worth exceeds  billion ."},{"url":null,"title":"498422","story":"The Diocese of Derry has launched a redesigned and modern new website that will allow people access to parish information and resources at the click of a button. www.derrydiocese.org is both mobile and desktop friendly with easy to use dropdown menus that allow users to navigate through the latest news, events, works and ministries in the Diocese, along with a handy parish and clergy finder. Father Micheaacutel McGavigan, Director of the Diocesan Pastoral Centre, who has overseen the development of the new website said: “Communication is changing in the st Century and we, as a Diocese, want to ensure we are communicating with parishioners and the wider community in the most effective way possible. googletag.cmd.push “The new website has a fresh look with navigation that makes it much easier for people to find material. It also contains contact and other information on all of the Diocese’s  parishes across Derry, Donegal and Tyrone. “The aim is to communicate effectively with all of those currently active in parishes as well to encourage those who want to reconnect with their faith or enquire about their local parish.” The Derry priest noted that one of the key themes of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is: ’To Make Jesus Known and Loved.’  He continued: “As well as the new website being a reference point for information about parishes, priests and organisations, it seeks to be a tool for evangelisation. Events that are happening around the diocese will be publicised, and good news stories shared and the faith of the people of the Diocese will be nourished. googletag.cmd.push “People will be able to find details of upcoming events at parish and diocesan level Mass times, details of clergy, and ious organisations at work within the diocese and across Ireland that are associated with the Catholic Church. “People will also be able to stay up to date with the Diocesan Pastoral Plan as the Diocese works towards the Diocesan Assembly in . “The website also has links to external sites where people can find out more about their faith and what we believe and why. We look forward to people looking at the website and giving us their feedback.” In tandem with the new website, the Derry Diocese has also developed another online page, dedicated solely to the development of Vocations for men and women. www.derryvocations.orgcan be accessed directly from diocesan website, and also as an independent domain. Father Chris Ferguson, Director of Vocations said that an important part of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan is highlighting the importance of vocation. He added: “As Christians, we believe every person has received a personal calling from God, which we are asked to respond to throughout our lives. In Baptism, every person is welcomed into the community of God’s people. We all have a part to play in Jesus’ mission to bring healing and mercy. “In a desire to create a culture of vocations, the vocations website is designed to help people question and celebrate their calling in le. The website has been created to provide information and support to those seeking to discover who God is calling them to be, and what path in le might bring them true contentment and happiness. Both websites are now live and can be accessed at www.derrydiocese.org and www.derryvocations.org   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, has taken the opportunity to extend an invitation to citizens throughout the city. Niall McCarroll DTUC Chairperson says: DTUC invites all citizens to come along to our Workers Hustings event, a hustings which will provide an opportunity to show solidarity with those workers currently taking strike action and to engage in a question and answer session with the candidates standing in the upcoming Foyle constituency Westminster elections.Conveniently, the narrative for this election is that the British withdrawal from the EU is the main issue in which people should focus and vote accordingly. The establishment political classes systematically set the narrative, attempting to dictate and control. This hustings will give people, and specically workers the opportunity to discuss the real matters at hand. Matters such as cuts to health, education and the diminishing right to social equality and le chances, through poverty pay and the relentless attacks on terms and conditions of employment.The narrative at the DTUC hustings will be set by workers including teachers, classroom assistants, civil servants, Community and Voluntary Sector workers, youth workers, hotel workers, nurses, and Health and Social Care workers, everyone is welcome.DTUC send out a message of solidarity to all those workers struggling under a system which values only the system. A solution needs to be found through a determined revolt, inspired by a trade union movement workers led revolution.The accessibility of liberty, free from oppressive restrictions would seem to have been achieved for all, but is this the case  When a child goes to school hungry, to a school unable toeffectively due to a lack of resources, where is the ownership of that childs le  Health and Social Care services are collapsing but so too is society, collapsing under the rule of capitalist governments, depriving working class communities of true liberty and opportunity.Working class communities deserve better, workers deserve equality, now more than ever we need to organise and mobilise, a class war is raging and key battles lie ahead. This is what this election should be about, fighting back and electing those who will stand up to the establishment, breaking the mould, not just becoming part of the establishment when elected.Workers and their families need both political leadership and solidarity. The DTUC Workers Hustings will provide the Foyle constituency candidates with an opportunity to listen to workers and detail why a vote for them is a vote to fight, a vote worth giving.Out of the seven Foyle candidates, four have confirmed attendance, Anne McCloskey , Colum Eastwood , Elisha McCallionand Shaun Harkin .Darren Guy , Gary Middleton , and Rachael Fergusonall said they had made prior arrangements and therefore couldnt attend. googletag.cmd.push The DTUC Workers Hustings will take place at UNISON Hall, Clarendon Street, Derry, on December  at pm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That remained in place for five years.Minor work commenced at the site last week just days before planning permission was due to expire on Saturday, November . Two applications for ‘Discharge of Conditions’ were also being processed right up to the deadline.One Derry councillor, Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, has questioned why there was such a last minute “scramble” and he believes the owners should publicly declare their intentions. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said: “We have been waiting seventeen years now for something to be built there. It’s another one of these areas of Derry where we’ve been told there are plans for development but nothing is happening.“There seems to be a bit of a scramble on right now but seventeen years is too long to wait in my opinion.“It’s one thing to build a hotel, and we are eager for more development and investment in Derry, we want to see good paying jobs but there have been a lot of hotels built recently and there are plans for others.“There is a crying need for more housing in the city and that has to be looked at. If this proposal isn’t able to progress then Council has to look at other options.”Chair of the committee, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Christopher Jackson, said that given public interest in the site the owners do “owe the people of Derry” an explanation. He was however “delighted” to see work begin on the site as it in a prime location at the “gateway to the city”.“We’re pushing to regenerate the city so it is disappointing to see a gap site like that. It was disappointing to see the former building destroyed by fire and we are all keen to see it replaced.”There had been some public scepticism about work commencing days before permission expired.Cllr Jackson said he hopes that wasn’t just done to “keep the permission alive” but is rather a “statement of intent”. Laying foundations is a tactic used by developers to trigger planning permission on occasion, he said, but any unnecessary delays would be “unacceptable” in this instance. He echoed Cllr Harkin’s call for the owners to clearly state their intentions along with a timeframe.“The owner has gone to considerable expense putting the application through so I would be hopeful they are willing proceed,” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push Owners Site owner, Rajesh Rana, of Andras House Ltd has been described as one of Northern Ireland’s most prominent and successful businessmen. He is also President of Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce.Mr Rana is director of Andras Hotels which his father Baron Diljit Rana founded. It is Belfast’s largest hotel group, who own and operate six hotels in the city, the newest investment being a poundmillion Hampton by Hilton hotel which opened last year off Great Victoria Street.In January of this year Andras was granted planning permission for a new pound.m, -bedroom hotel in Portrush.The planning committee at Causeway Coast and Glens Council dismissed concerns that the demolition of the former Londonderry Hotel for a new building could harm the historic streetscape character of the town centre.Over  years have elapsed since Andras House Ltd first mooted plans to redevelop the Derry site.Originally an application was made to redevelop the famous shirt factory building in  to provide a hotel incorporating a fitness club, conference facilities and restaurants.However, a decision was taken to demolish the Tillie and Henderson building in  following a fire in December .In , Andras House, applied to build a  Bedroom hotel facility, an application that was later withdrawn.The site has therefore lain empty since the former listed building was demolished.Tillie and Henderson factory, which was built in , is seen by many as a symbol of Derrys textile industry, which dominated employment in the city for almost  years.Rajesh Rana was contacted for comment over the weekend but a response had not been provided at the time of going to press. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That remained in place for five years.Minor work commenced at the site last week just days before planning permission was due to expire on Saturday, November . Two applications for ‘Discharge of Conditions’ were also being processed right up to the deadline.One Derry councillor, Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, has questioned why there was such a last minute “scramble” and he believes the owners should publicly declare their intentions. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said: “We have been waiting seventeen years now for something to be built there. It’s another one of these areas of Derry where we’ve been told there are plans for development but nothing is happening.“There seems to be a bit of a scramble on right now but seventeen years is too long to wait in my opinion.“It’s one thing to build a hotel, and we are eager for more development and investment in Derry, we want to see good paying jobs but there have been a lot of hotels built recently and there are plans for others.“There is a crying need for more housing in the city and that has to be looked at. If this proposal isn’t able to progress then Council has to look at other options.”Chair of the committee, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Christopher Jackson, said that given public interest in the site the owners do “owe the people of Derry” an explanation. He was however “delighted” to see work begin on the site as it in a prime location at the “gateway to the city”.“We’re pushing to regenerate the city so it is disappointing to see a gap site like that. It was disappointing to see the former building destroyed by fire and we are all keen to see it replaced.”There had been some public scepticism about work commencing days before permission expired.Cllr Jackson said he hopes that wasn’t just done to “keep the permission alive” but is rather a “statement of intent”. Laying foundations is a tactic used by developers to trigger planning permission on occasion, he said, but any unnecessary delays would be “unacceptable” in this instance. He echoed Cllr Harkin’s call for the owners to clearly state their intentions along with a timeframe.“The owner has gone to considerable expense putting the application through so I would be hopeful they are willing proceed,” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push Owners Site owner, Rajesh Rana, of Andras House Ltd has been described as one of Northern Ireland’s most prominent and successful businessmen. He is also President of Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce.Mr Rana is director of Andras Hotels which his father Baron Diljit Rana founded. It is Belfast’s largest hotel group, who own and operate six hotels in the city, the newest investment being a poundmillion Hampton by Hilton hotel which opened last year off Great Victoria Street.In January of this year Andras was granted planning permission for a new pound.m, -bedroom hotel in Portrush.The planning committee at Causeway Coast and Glens Council dismissed concerns that the demolition of the former Londonderry Hotel for a new building could harm the historic streetscape character of the town centre.Over  years have elapsed since Andras House Ltd first mooted plans to redevelop the Derry site.Originally an application was made to redevelop the famous shirt factory building in  to provide a hotel incorporating a fitness club, conference facilities and restaurants.However, a decision was taken to demolish the Tillie and Henderson building in  following a fire in December .In , Andras House, applied to build a  Bedroom hotel facility, an application that was later withdrawn.The site has therefore lain empty since the former listed building was demolished.Tillie and Henderson factory, which was built in , is seen by many as a symbol of Derrys textile industry, which dominated employment in the city for almost  years.Rajesh Rana was contacted for comment over the weekend but a response had not been provided at the time of going to press. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

A “winter pressures” media briefing took place at Altnagelvin today where Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Services, Mark Gillespie, Assistant Director of Acute Services and Brendan Lavery, Lead Consultant in Emergency Medicine, outlined measures being taken ahead of the busy winter period. AE attendees at the Derry hospital have risen year on year since , in the past year alone by .% or , people, making clear the case for an expanded Emergency Department . Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. googletag.cmd.push Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -. The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year. The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”.It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. googletag.cmd.push Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December . Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said. She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board. The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care. That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” See Thursdays edition of the Derry News for full coverage.

The likes of Martin Roddy, Andy Russell, Paul Deery and Tony Fleming, to mention a few. These guys taught me a lot as I came up through the ranks and I will be forever thankful to them.‘The Fire Service is one big family and everyone had each other’s back. I worked with a great bunch of lads at both fire stations and had many happy years in Red Watch.’Jim said he hoped to take a few months off and relax and take in a few foreign holidays, adding he would miss the Service and intends to keep in touch with his former colleagues.“I will miss the boys, of course, and it will take a bit of getting used to.”Reminiscing on some of the more “hairy” shouts he took part in over the years, he continued: “I remember the serious trouble that kicked off in the city over the Drumcree situation a few years ago. We were in the middle trying to put a fire out with petrol and blast bombs coming from one side and plastic bullets from the other.“A notable event was three rescues in a -minute period late one night. We pulled people from a building in Nicholson Square, minutes later more at Duncreggan Road before rushing to Shantallow’s Ardnamoyle Park for another. I think it was  people in the three shouts. Never known it to happen before and hope it never happens again. And on a lighter side, he recalled working on night sht and getting a call to a car fire in Foyle Street car park.Jim recalled: “We got out of the appliance and the car was well alight. I was putting water onto the fire and I said to my mate that car looks like mine. I went around to the front and checked the number plate - it was mine! “Margaret, my we, had been up at St Columb’s Hall at choir practice. No sympathy from the boys either. When we went back to the station they were trying to sell me hot cars and asbestos seat covers.”The popular firefighter was well supported at Thursday night’s presentation with over  firefighters in attendance at the Bishop’s Gate Hotel with many speeches praising Jim and wishing him a long and happy retirement.And what does the future hold for Jim  He said: “After a few holidays I hope to carry out some voluntary work with local dementia groups. My late mother suffered from the disease and it would be nice to give something back in her memory.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jarvis, who has publicly thanked the Dundalk fans for their support during his two years at Oriel Park, admitted that his desire to be closer to his family is one of the main factors in deciding his next move. “I have been chatting to a few teams,” he admitted. “Im  with a young family so I want to move closer to home. “Living away from my family and travelling up and down to Dundalk was hard. I have to take all that into consideration.“Ive chatted to Paddy McCourt but nothing has been finalised. I have had deeper discussions with other teams and Derry are still in the pack.“ I remember at the start of last year Deckygot in contact with me. I was in his plans then. Tiernanat Larne was the same last year as well, and even before I signed with Dundalk, but it all still has to be decided.”Still only , Jarvis has won more than many players manage in a career, but he is still hungry for more success, and his continued ambition is something which must be matched by his next club.“One of the main reasons I left Derry was because I thought I had a better chance of winning stuff,” he admitted. “I went down there and I couldnt ask for any more because Ive won everything available in the past two years so it was a good decision from that point of view.“The whole standard of the group and inidually was high. “Everyone was always trying to push on knowing that we were trying to win the league at the start of each year. We wanted to win everything. “Last year we started out looking to win the treble and we were a penalty shoot-out away from that. “Wherever I go next Ill be looking for the same standard. It might not be the heights of Dundalk because the last two years it has been unbelievable but wherever I go Ill be pushing to do the same and hopefully using my experience to help the group.”First team footballJarvis admits he is in no hurry to make his mind up, but first team football, something he constantly battled for at Dundalk, is another key factor whichever team he chooses.“The end of last season didnt go as planned,” he stated. “At the start of the season I was in the team and playing well and hoping to kick on - wherever I go I want to be playing every week, and do my best to start every week and thats not going to change.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house.

I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

It is obviously a cost cutting exercise Kilkeel got £k for a tree where Newcastle got £k for theirs.” After representations from the Chamber of Commerce, he had raised the impending problem repeatedly since October , but to no avail, he said.Kilkeel Chamber of Commerce said it has been advised the council will erect a new tree this week. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said it “recognises the disappointment” and is “moving forward with a solution”.“For a number of years it has been the preference of the local community to light up a large pine tree in Kilkeel as its Christmas tree,” it said in a statement. “As the tree has grown over the years this has become increasingly dficult to light in a way which represents the traditional Christmas tree shape. “Newry, Mourne and Down District Council managed to do this last year but this involved placing the sets of lights in such a way that they were exposed to signicant movement during windy conditions, resulting in the lights breaking and requiring a lot of repair during the festive season.“The Council spent £ on these lights last year and at the end of the season they were in such a poor condition that they could no longer be used.Michelle ONeill: Form a just and sustainable powersharing administratrionLame donkey Brexit must be reconsidered, Alliance Leader Naomi Long says Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This year Council staff carried the lights along the main branches so that they would not be subject to the same level of movement.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Pic by Tony Henderson.Smith made the short trip from his Portadown home to Shamrock Park hoping to have masterminded a midweek gameplan to break his run of disappointments since swapping Annagh United for Loughgall in November .His seat offered a perfect vantage point as Peter Campbell caused multiple problems for the Ports in a dazzling display capped by breaking the deadlock.However, Smith also had to watch Portadown complete a comeback thanks to late goals from Aaron Duke and Conal McGrandles. “I’m gutted for the players as not too many teams will come to Shamrock Park, dominate the game and limit Portadown to two shots,” said Smith. “I felt to come out with a point even would have been criminal, so it’s gut-wrenching.“When we first came in at Loughgall as a management team I felt there was a fear in the squad about coming to Shamrock Park.“In my first few games we seemed to have lost at times before a ball had been kicked.“So that has come full circle . We now come to Portadown with confidence and able to play free-flowing football on the attack.“The club has come on leaps and bounds in my two or three seasons here, not just in terms of players but across the pitch, behind the scenes and the backroom staff.“The club has developed so much on and off the pitch too, including bringing better personnel to the club so that, in turn, should lead to greater results.“So much work has been put in overall and now we are leaving places like Portadown disappointed not to have our just rewards.“We’ve played better and a couple of inidual mistakes cost us but today was certainly our best performance of the past few games.“The players gave everything, inidually and collectively.“It’s a long season and the luck we maybe had at the early stage of the season is not with us at the minute but will hopefully come back.“Peter Campbell was outstanding, Nathaniel Ferris fantastic and Jordan Gibson running things in midfield.“I think Peter is the best player in this league and he’s added goals now to his pace and all-round game.“He’s invaluable, with a great attitude on and off the pitch, and I’m sure he will go on to play at a higher level.“He came to us from Portadown and has developed here season-on-season, with that physical strength now added to Peter’s other attributes.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"substitute aaron duke aiming build derby boost portadown ","story":"These are the warning symptoms of flu and norovirus parents need to know - and how to stop the viruses spreadingKeady baby death | Rest with the angels baby Hunter -  month old baby Hunter McGleenan was cherished by mumNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsSubstitute Aaron Duke aiming to build on derby boost for PortadownAaron Duke is hoping to turn  memorable minutes into a long-term spot in the starting line-up thanks to his match-defining introduction off the weekend substitutes’ bench.By The NewsroomFriday, th November , : pm\" enjoys his successful substitute appearance for Portadown against Loughgall.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs. Deloitte has confirmed that Bamford Bus Company Limited, a company which is led by industrialist Jo Bamford, has agreed a deal to buy the business and assets of Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited and Metallix Limited “The deal also includes an option to acquire the international ision of Wright Group Limited.” However, it remains unclear how many of the , jobs could be saved. Bamford Bus Company says it is “currently determining the size and composition of the workforce required for its future plans, but the  staff retained by the joint administrators have transferred to Bamford Bus Company”. Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were last month appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Meanwhile, in a separate deal, Jans Composites Limited has also agreed the purchase of Wright Composites Limited for an undisclosed sum. “Three staff members who were retained by the joint administrators, have transferred with the business. The purchaser is currently determining the size and the composition of the workforce it requires going forward.\" Peter Allen, joint administrator, said: “We are delighted to have reached a deal with Bamford Bus Company to secure the future of the business in Ballymena.  After making extensive efforts to find a buyer, we are confident the new owner represents a bright future for a key employer in Northern Ireland.” Jo Bamford says that \"Wrightbus is a proud family business which is part of the fabric of Northern Ireland le and business\". \"I am delighted to acquire such an established and respected brand. We can now start to look to the future and build on the excellent work that Sir William Wright and his family have done to develop the Wrightbus business. \"We will now begin speaking with customers and suppliers over the coming weeks in order to take a closer look at the financial situation that Wrightbus faces in order to build a viable and sustainable business.\" Mr Bamford will serve as executive chairman of Wrightbus and Buta Atwal becomes chief executive Mr Atwal said: \"As bus transportation looks to decarbonise, there is growing demand for market leaders in this field. Wrightbus has the potential to lead the way in this area given its track record in manufacturing state of the art zero emission hydrogen buses as well as electric and hybrid models.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
