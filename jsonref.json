The railroads brought white settlers from the East who poured across the Mississippi to mine, farm, and ranch in the hope of making their fortunes. The rush created a few mining camps such as Denver City and Boulder City that would later develop into cities         A steer being successfully rounded up, lassoed to the floor and slaughtered. The loss of the bison and growth of white settlement drastically affected the lives of the indigenous Americans living in the West. A significant proportion of cowboys were of Latin or Chinese descent and black cowboys were also not uncommon during the period         Loading up the donkeys with silver to carry it back to town. The life of the cowboy was far from glamorous, involving long, hard hours of labor, poor living conditions, and economic hardship. After losing decisive battles most of the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes which lives in the areas affected by the rush were moved to a reservation in present-day Oklahoma         A cowboy brought to life in color by these photochroms. The life of a cattleman has been glamorized over the years with the reality very different from the one portrayed in films and TV. The Colorado Gold Rush is often referred to as the \u0027Pikes Peak Gold Rush\u0027 and lead to the creation of the Colorado Territory in 1861          A pack of mules carrying lumber in Colorado. In 1859 the number of \u002759ers\u0027 as they became known peaked as they flooded to Colorado after the discovery of gold around a decade earlier. By the 1880s, most Native American had been confined to reservations, often in areas of the West that appeared least desirable to white settlers         A man fishing on Williams\u0027 Fork, Middle Park, in Colorado. Over 100,000 people participated in the Colorado Gold Rush rush and were known as \u0027Fifty-Niners\u0027, a reference to 1859, the year the rush to Colorado peaked. As many as 40,000 were thought to have made the journey at the height of the rush         Conditions during the turn of the 19th century could often be brutal for the settlers and the indigenous population. Pictured is a miner\u0027s cabin in winter covered in snow. After 1858 Anglo-Americans increasingly occupied the areas inhabited by the Plains Indians, killing buffalo, trampling grazing grass, and cutting down timber. Native Americans soon found their resource base dwindling, and some began raiding wagon trains for supplies or in hopes of scaring off other white immigrants         A pack train on a treacherous mountain road in the Colorado Rockies. Gold was first discovered by a group of Cherokee on their way to California over the Cherokee Trail when they found gold in a stream bed in the South Platte basin, near present-day Denver. The information remained unused for around a decade until it reached William Green Russell, a Georgian who was married to a Cherokee woman and had worked the California gold fields in the 1850s. He sent an exploration party to the area         A mine in Colorado. Precious metals drew thousands of people to the West Coast during the 1850s. By 1859, large numbers of prospective miners and settlers had come up the Kansas River valley to the Denver area.

Allen died in October 2018 while suffering from non-Hodgkins\u0027 lymphoma, just months after the plane\u0027s development was unveiled.We all know Paul would have been proud to witness today’s historic achievement, said Jody Allen, Chair of Vulcan Inc and Trustee of the Paul G.

Sats could be cancelled in some schools if members vote in favour of a boycott. However, headteachers could bring in substitute staff to oversee the exams in other schools.

But she raised concerns that a ballot could potentially be lost within the time available.When an initial show of hands appeared inconclusive, the union decided to take the vote electronically – and 56 per cent of delegates voted in favour of the action. The move came after Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Layla Moran called for Sats and tests in reception to be scrapped to ensure important parts of the curriculum were not ignored. She told teachers at the conference in Liverpool: “Finally, it is high time we ended the unnecessary stress placed on pupils and teachers by high-stakes testing in primary schools.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “The resolution reflects the deep unhappiness of primary teachers in England with their current, SATs-based system of assessment. “There can be no lasting solution to problems of children’s well-being, teacher workload, curriculum narrowness and teaching to the test unless our assessment system changes.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The features encourage them to stay online longer and so could damage their wellbeing, the major report suggests.The report also suggests that such features should be banned entirely on websites that can\u0027t be sure whether or not their users are under-18.

The internet and all its wonders are hardwired into their everyday lives.We shouldn\u0027t have to prevent our children from being able to use it, but we must demand that they are protected when they do. This code does that.Welcoming the proposals, the NSPCC said social networks had continually failed to prioritise child safety in their design resulting in tragic consequences.That\u0027s why it is vital this code requires children to be given the highest privacy settings by default and forces firms to act in the best interest of children, the charity\u0027s associate head of child safety online, Andy Burrows, said.This design code from the ICO is a really significant package of measures, but it must go hand in hand with the Government following through on its commitment to enshrine in law a new duty of care on social networks and an independent regulator with powers to investigate and fine.Baroness Beeban Kidron, chairwoman of the 5Rights Foundation, said the code represents the beginning of a new deal between children and the tech sector.For too long we have failed to recognise children\u0027s rights and needs online, with tragic outcomes, she said.I firmly believe in the power of technology to transform lives, be a force for good and rise to the challenge of promoting the rights and safety of our children.But in order to fulfil that role, it must consider the best interests of children, not simply its own commercial interests.That is what the code will require online services to do. This is a systemic change.The ICO\u0027s draft code was not universally welcomed, with the Adam Smith Institute saying it should be up to parents to keep their children safe online.The think tank\u0027s head of research, Matthew Lesh, criticised the proposal to set privacy settings at their highest by default.He said: The ICO is an unelected quango introducing draconian limitations on the internet with the threat of massive fines.It is ridiculous to infantilise people and treat everyone as children.The consultation is out until May 31 and the final version is expected to come into effect by 2020.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ve adapted to change before. They must do so againClick to followThe IndependentIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics, the Tories must lead the way, both in tone and contentThe Parliamentary Conservative Party notoriously has two default settings: complacency or panic.The pressure of the Brexit process has moved the dial significantly towards the latter, although one should never underestimate the capacity of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership skills to encourage Conservatives into the former.For anyone who thinks long-term, though, the departure of colleagues with stinging remarks about destroying the Conservative Party should be worrying. Almost the worst thing about the early days of the Independent Group was that the Labour defectors were clearly distraught about leaving their political home, while the Tory defectors looked exultant.Is this the beginning of the end?I strongly believe that it need not be, and indeed will not be as long as the post-Brexit Conservative Party pours as much energy into its domestic policies and widening its base as it has into European affairs.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

In the late 1990s it looked as though Conservatives were destined for extinction in Scotland and Wales. The party now has significant representation in both countries, allowing it once again to become the truly national UK-wide party it has always been.Also over the last decade the party in parliament has begun to look much more like modern Britain in all its variety. It seems overwhelmingly likely that, just as the Conservatives were the first party to elect a woman leader, it will be the first party to elect one from a Bame background. Of course there is much more to do but the party has recognised the problem of looking and sounding too narrow and is taking effective steps to address it.Conservatives would be ‘wiped out’ in snap general election – Tory MPBefore I seem to sink back into the mode of complacency I should acknowledge that real problems exist. The membership of the party is not even representative of Conservative voters, let alone the wider country. It is much smaller than it used to be. It is possible to exaggerate how much older the Conservative Party membership is than Labour’s, but it is still true that some 44 per cent of Conservative members are over 65, compared with 30 per cent for other parties.There is also a whiff of intolerance in the air inside the party which is new and dangerous. Deselection is a word which in the past has only been associated with the unpleasant actions of the hard left of the Labour Party. If it becomes a habitual threat from the hard right of the Tory party it will signify a move away from being a party of government. It should be stamped out immediately.But to address any of these long-term issues requires progress on Brexit, and then a move on to other matters. We all know that the Brexit vote represented a myriad of discontents, some of them shared across the west since 2008, and some specific to this country. What the Conservative Party needs to do is address the various sources of discontent.Ashdown and Lord Kinnock (PA)This is more difficult than previously. In 2005, after our third election defeat in a row, I gave the Macmillan Lecture for the Tory Reform Group and observed that: “If the Conservative Party does not like modern Britain it is unlikely that modern Britain will warm to the Conservative Party.”Much of that problem was solved by David Cameron and his modernisation programme. The current leadership faces the even more intractable problem that modern Britain no longer seems to like itself. The tone of political discourse ranges from the harsh to the disgraceful. Violent language is common. Disgracefully, and occasionally tragically, this spills over into physical violence.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics the Conservative Party in its post-Brexit phase needs to lead the way, both in tone and content. The tone required is one of respect not just for each other and our varying views but for our political opponents as well. This is not easy.The current Labour Party is determined to establish a false and unpleasant narrative: that the (necessary) period of austerity after 2008 means that every inidual Conservative politician is complicit in creating poverty and misery and is therefore beyond the pale. It is very tempting to respond in kind, but this temptation should be resisted.Raising the debate from the gutter is the right thing to do and will in the long run benefit those who do it, as long as the underlying discontents are addressed at the same time.Long ago\u0026nbspRab\u0026nbspButler said he was keen to make it ‘perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory’. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a ToryInevitably, after the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent global recession, there are no lack of problems requiring a hard-headed but warm-hearted solution, in the best tradition of One-Nation Conservativism. As we move out of the austerity period we have the chance to provide a mixture of targeted increases in public spending and tax cuts which will provide future prosperity both for the country and the party.That chance will only come if there is a successful Brexit settlement which releases the large amount of stalled investment that has been waiting for certainty but if and when this happens, the opportunities are huge.In politics and economics maths is everything. If your economy grows at 2.5 per cent a year, you can afford to increase public spending, cut taxes, and have some left over to reduce long-term debt. If it grows at 1.5 per cent a year, which would probably be our fate if Brexit goes wrong, you don’t have enough flexibility.Although sorting Brexit is therefore the first and overwhelming priority, the choices the party makes about where it concentrates next are key.This is not the place for detailed policy blueprints, but the areas for activity are pretty clear. We need to meet the needs of those parts of the country which did not benefit from the finance-driven globalisation of the 1990s. The Northern Powerhouse was a good idea and needs to be made a reality. Coastal towns, and more generally medium-sized towns with no nearby big city, have special needs.Created with Sketch.

There are wonderful frames, with leading lines, repetitions of numbers and angles, soft light, hanging clocks. People wait to be taken elsewhereThe first thing I see in the city is a drunk man lying on the floor of the train station. He can’t walk, is completely unresponsive, and has a blank, vacant expression on his face, as if he’d just had his memory erasedDismantling the tree of love, one heart at a time, until it’s bare and loveless and wintry. The city has made love one of its symbols since the Beatles told the world it’s all you need. I wonder what will become of these plastic heartsMaking a joint with one arm under angels, the other in a sling. I don’t stick around to find out how he rolls it, singlehandedly or otherwisePeople browse the outdoor market, tempted into sales. I’m there to look at them, and in this scene they mix with boxes of music in working order, a Disney wink, and a limp Union JackI’m impressed how humans are dwarfed by human-made structures in the urban environment. The building is gigantic, geometrically solid and powerfully symmetrical, while the tiny man slouches, humanly imperfect and asymmetricalThe play on words for this new development is a footer to the town’s skyline, along which run the grey heights of a multi-storey carpark, Chapel Street Church spire, and the faint tops of housesI’m led into the train station by a man on his mobility scooter. I photograph him and his sign, then take the train to Preston. I thought it was strange how someone could be so proud of a city, with all its details and complexitiesIt’s one of the sickly contradictions of advertising: you can save money by spending it. Here it is presented as the headline of Bolton market, put so simply, yet still so complicatedWhen people stop to speak to rough sleepers it always looks so unbalanced. The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downAway from the geographical concentrations of disadvantage which the government should address, the national challenges are equally clear.The first tentative steps towards a revival of home ownership have been taken, but this ought to be much higher in the political mix. The unfairly neglected Industrial Strategy needs to be at the heart of what the government both does and talks about between now and 2022. If we get right our policy towards artificial intelligence, 5G, electric vehicles, and other new technology, then the effects of Brexit will be relatively small. The same is of course true on the downside.If it is to meet present\u0026nbspchallenges, the party will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevanceThis is not to neglect the traditional areas of policy dispute. Just as health now has a growing budget and a proper long-term plan, I would like to see education treated in the same way. By education I don’t just mean school and universities, but also the FE and apprenticeship sectors, which deserve more attention than ever before.In social policy, I think grasping the nettle on social care funding should be the start of a much deeper process of rethinking our attitude to the over-60s to recognise the fact that people commonly live to be 90 or older and are fitter and healthier than ever before into their 70s. We should stop assuming that everyone over the age of 65 is frail and just wants a quiet life. Staying in the world of work is not just better for the economy, it is usually better for the inidual.There is no shortage of challenges, and happily no shortage of thinking about them. Both my colleagues in parliament, and centre-right thinktanks new and old, are fertile in creating policy ideas. For the country’s sake, these ideas need a successful political party to make them real. Far from being defunct, the Conservative Party is needed as much as ever to shape Britain in the post-Brexit world.Tory Party being ‘hollowed out’ by ex-Ukip members, John Major sayIf it is to meet this challenge, it will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevance. It also needs to regain the mantle of the party that offers opportunity to all.Millennials have been foisted with an unfair reputation as entitled snowflakes. They are having to cope with a fast-changing world of work which offers less security than their parents enjoyed, and a significantly more difficult route to settled prosperity in their own home. Most of them want that, and the political prize for offering it is huge.These substantive policy areas will be much more likely to win first-time voters than any improvement to campaigning techniques on social media, necessary though they are.At the same time, leading Conservatives need to take every chance to show that being a Conservative does not in some way mark you out from the rest of the country. Corbyn’s Labour Party is determined to pursue this idea, and it needs refuting. Long ago Rab Butler said he was keen to make it “perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory”. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a Tory.These various policy suggestions involve recasting some traditional Conservative values, including opportunity for all, home ownership and support for business, to make them fit for the mid-21st century.This will allow the party to follow one of the wise points made by another Tory guru, Keith Joseph, in the 1970s, when he said that instead of the centre ground, politicians should seek the common ground. It is a subtle but important difference, in that it means that instead of triangulating between the existing extremes, you identify new areas of concern which the people may have reached before the politicians.The Brexit vote showed that there was indeed a disconnect between political conventional wisdom and the desires of the British people. Throughout its history the Conservative Party has been sensitive to such changes, and adept at adapting to them.It needs to do so again.Damian Green has been the Conservative MP for Ashford since 1997 and was the first secretary of state and minister for the Cabinet Office from June to December 2017Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would be very afraid of the threat to the peace process, it was a dreadful time to live through. Even to go to mass on a Sunday, you’d have to go through checkpoints. It is terribly stressful,’ said Mullen. ‘All those barricades and boundaries were pulled down. I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghThe two statesmen also issued a warning on what they see as strained relations between their two countries, noting that there is “no variation of Brexit that can strengthen the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.They also warn that the political crisis is weakening the union, and strengthening the argument for Irish reunification. “You cannot walk around the island of Ireland without being asked about the future of a united Ireland – and that has resulted from the position on the Border taken by Brexiteers.”Pointing out that any Brexit agreement is now “unlikely to be what the public voted for”, the former prime ministers call on Theresa May to give the people of the UK the final say.Northern Ireland is ided, but a united Ireland is now a possibilityMr Blair has been a fervent advocate for a second referendum on Brexit, which he called on Ms May to implement as a solution to the impasse in December 2018.\u0026nbspMr Ahern, who served as Irish taoiseach from 1997 to 2008 was today appointed an honorary professor in peace studies by Queen’s University in Belfast.\u0026nbspThe Good Friday Agreement was ratified by two referendums held on 22 May 1998, in which 94 per cent\u0026nbspof people in the Republic of Ireland, and 71 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Northern Ireland voted Yes.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.521 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

And Facebook was my primary digital organising tool for a very long time. I gave up on it,” she told listeners, according to the New York Post. “Social media poses a public health risk to everybody.”Speaking on the podcast “Skulldudgery”, she added: “There are amplified impacts for young people, particularly children under the age of 3, with screen time. But I think it has a lot of effects on older people. I think it has effects on everybody. Increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.“I’ve started to kind of impose little rules on myself.”Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - the Democratic congresswoman in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019When the 29-year-old was elected last year to represent New York’s 14th Congressional district, she did so with a grassroots campaign\u0026nbspthat was in part driven by her skills on social media.Since, moving to Washington, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who has 3.9m Twitter followers, has used most social media platforms to rebut critics, and reach out to supporters.Live streams on Instagram of her putting together furniture or cooking dinner while chatting to people, have become an art form on their own. \u0026nbspAOC mentioned 3,181 times on Fox in just six weeksNancy Pelosi once again mocked AOC for relying on Twitter for supportJeremy Corbyn gives gardening advice to AOCTucker Carlson complains that ‘feminists do science’Meet the Trump supporter trying to take AOC down“Like every once in a while, you’ll see me hop on Twitter on the weekends, but for the most part, I take consumption of content, when it comes to consumption and reading, I take the weekends off,” she said.\u0026nbsp“And so I’m not, like, scrolling through trying to read everything online that journalists are writing on weekends.

But it was only when the pair came home, entered the flat, and two assailants jumped out from behind the curtains that he started to realise\u0026nbsphow badly wrong things had gone.The men announced to\u0026nbspSergei\u0026nbspthat his date was, in fact, a minor – even though his profile and appearance suggested he was at least 20. The attackers\u0026nbspgave their victim\u0026nbspa frightening ultimatum: “20,000 rubles (£250) or be outed as a poof and reported as a paedophile.”\u0026nbspSergei\u0026nbspwas lucky that a 20-year army career meant he could stand up to the men physically. After an hour, he managed to persuade them to go outside so he could try to get money from a cashpoint. From there, he ran. \u0026nbspHis story is one of several\u0026nbspcrimes committed against gay men in Moscow over the last month.The Independent was able to speak\u0026nbspto three of the targeted men. They\u0026nbspsuggested that gangs operating in the capital had identified gay men as easy – and silent – victims.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The top 15 worst countries to be gay in Europe Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This content is subject to copyright.This content is subject to copyright.The mechanism is\u0026nbspalmost always the same. Handsome young men entrap unwitting victims on dating apps and other gay sites. They lure victims to an apartment, where several other gang members are waiting. The assailants film their victim, extort money and threaten them with outing or worse. Usually, the victims pay up for a quiet life. On the occasions that they don’t, things can end brutally.\u0026nbspWhile an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties of being gay in Russia, these incidents are not an entirely new phenomenon —\u0026nbspor even the worst examples of homophobia.\u0026nbspChechnya\u0026nbspaside, the peak of anti-gay violence in Russia came about four years ago, when groups led by the nationalist\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbsp(aka “The Hatchet”) entrapped, beat and humiliated dozens of gay men on camera.\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspand his “Occupy\u0026nbspPedophilia” gang operated on the heels of the Kremlin’s 2013 infamous anti-gay law.But Martsinkevich\u0026nbspand his crew were always less concerned with money than with serving a warped ideology.\u0026nbspActivists say the vast majority of the more recent attacks have been economic in their aims.When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, the state does everything to avoid prosecutionThat does not mean there have not been victims of violence. On several occasions, young men have been found in pools of blood following apparent robbery attempts, and without obvious signs of forced entry.\u0026nbspBut today’s gangs do tend to be less violent, and instead use the taboo of homosexuality in society to keep the crimes as hidden as possible.\u0026nbspIt’s an effective enough strategy, says Igor\u0026nbspKochetkov, the head of the Russian\u0026nbspLGBT\u0026nbspNetwork, a prominent advocacy group.\u0026nbsp“People are reluctant to go to the police because they don’t want to reveal their orientation,” he says. “And the regular homophobic statements from officials don’t exactly encourage them.”\u0026nbspRussia reinstates yoga into prisons following claims it turned inmatesThe Russian court system is not set up to help them, the activist says. When the odd case does reach court, it is usually processed as hooliganism or robbery the hate element is never included as an aggravating factor. When\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspwas finally arrested and jailed in late 2014, for example, it was for a racist video. No mention was made of the anti-gay aspects of his extremism.\u0026nbsp“When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, such as what happened in\u0026nbspChechnya, the state does everything to avoid prosecution,”\u0026nbspsays Kochetkov.\u0026nbspAccording to Andrei Petrov, programme director of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ advocacy group Stimulus,\u0026nbspa lack of successful prosecutions is allowing the problem of date extortion to become more widespread.\u0026nbspIn a survey conducted by his organisation in 2018, one in five members of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ community reported that they had been victims of such hate crimes. Only a similar percentage report the crimes to police, and even fewer are properly investigated.\u0026nbspGiven the lack of progress in Russian courts, Stimulus has decided to try their luck with the European Court of Human Rights.\u0026nbspTwo killed and 40 held in new Chechen gay ‘purge’, activists sayTheir test case, which dates from 2017, follows the familiar pattern. The victim,\u0026nbspYevgeny, 39, surname withheld, answered a profile on a love.mail.ru, a well-known dating site. He sent his picture the other party sent his, and the pair agreed to meet by a block of flats in Moscow’s suburbs. Again, there were warning signs. The date said his name was\u0026nbspDima\u0026nbspin messages, but introduced himself as\u0026nbspDanila. But regardless,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspagreed to go upstairs to the\u0026nbspflat.There, a gang of eight men were waiting. They made sure\u0026nbspYevgeny’s\u0026nbspquick date instead ended in a heavy beating, a request for money, and a threat to call the police for “paedophilia”.\u0026nbspEventually,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspplucked up the courage to report the crime to the police. But since then, two years have passed without progress, with investigators refusing to open a criminal investigation.\u0026nbsp“I believe the police were covering them up,”\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspsays. “I’ve no doubt the guys think they are completely untouchable.”\u0026nbspActivists and victims allege the Russian government’s own “homophobia”\u0026nbsphas fuelled the extortion business.\u0026nbsp“The reason why these guys are getting away with it is because they are on the same side,” says\u0026nbspSergei. “One thing gives birth to another.

The UK government said\u0026nbspthe decision is down to the British Museum because the marbles are its “legal property”.In a January interview with Ta Nea, a Greek daily newspaper, British Museum director Hartwig Fischer ruled out returning the marbles, telling the publication: “The trustees of the British Museum feel the obligation to preserve the collection in its entirety, so that things that are part of this collection remain part of this collection.”Lord Elgin claimed\u0026nbsphe received permission from the authorities of the Ottoman empire, which\u0026nbspoccupied Greece at the time, to take the treasures.While this fact is in itself disputed, Greeks who demand the statues’ return say the occupying power did not have the legitimacy to give away such a central part of Greek cultural heritage.The return of the statues is one of the longest-running cultural heritage disputes on the planet, with their removal from Athens being denounced by some almost immediately in the 1800s.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indonesian soldiers and police at a general security roll call for the upcoming general elections in Jakarta.

Among critics of the British possession of the marbles was poet Lord Byron, who himself fought and died in the Greek war of independence from Ottoman Turkey.Defenders of keeping the statues in Britain have argued that returning them would set a precedent and lead to the potential return of a vast array of items from many of the world’s great museums, some of which were acquired in a similar manner. They say the British Museum is free to view.Polling conducted in 2014 suggested the British public mostly back the marbles’ return or are largely ambivalent: YouGov found 37 per cent think the statues should go back to Greece, 32 per cent did not mind either way, while 23 per cent said they should remain in Britain. Seven per cent said they did not know.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To say that leaving the EU, which they used to claim had negligible impact on our sovereignty, is in fact too hard. That it’s “undeliverable”.Remainer politicians told .million Leavers a pack of lies about honouring their vote. Now, as they hoped, Brexit is “delayed” again. And the EU, with whom some openly colluded, are gloating about it maybe being reversed.You think our nation is humiliated now  Wait until MPs revoke Article .The Tories are carrying the can, and fair enough. But at least most have tried to deliver what the majority wanted.Corbyn’s MPs duped Leavers, then opposed every step towards Brexit, in a disgusting assault on our democracy.Let’s hope democracy bites them back.DO not forget the blinkered delusions of the Tory ERG in this betrayal.They convinced themselves Brexit was inevitable. The law was on their side. Remainer tricks could not stop them. They fatally rejected the one viable deal, thinking a harder one was days away.It was all cobblers. They missed what everyone outside their bubble could see: they were outnumbered by Remainers who will scrap Brexitthey can.Yet the ERG still won’t back Theresa May’s deal. They are still in denial.Yes, their Brexit might be possible under a charismatic new Tory leader with a thumping Commons majority.Anyone see that happening THEY backed the Kremlin over the Salisbury poisonings.

But there are risks to this approach.Labour coming out for a second referendum would cost them in their Leave-voting seats and in the places they must win to form a government.Of the  seats in England and Wales that Corbyn needs to get a majority,  voted Leave. While  of his  most vulnerable seats backed Brexit.Corbyn’s other option is to do a deal with Mrs May.If he pushed her into accepting a customs union, then he would further ide the Tories.A deal would also mean Britain was out and that Corbyn could fight the next election on the domestic issues he cares about most.As one Cabinet Minister puts it: “There is an appeal for Corbyn to support something. He can create fissures within the Tory party, look serious, andhe becomes PM he doesn’t have to deal with all this crap.” But there are big risks to this approach, too.If Corbyn helped a Brexit deal over the line, there would almost certainly be more defections from the Labour Party.It would also produce a rallying cry for Chuka and Co.They would be able to tell pro-Remain votersthat Labour had betrayed them, that it could have stopped Brexit but chose not to.This is a finely balanced decision for Corbyn. But he doesn’t have long to make up his mind. If the Tories take a pasting in either next month’s local elections or the European elections, then Mrs May could be gone as Tory leader — replaced by a Brexiteer.This new Tory leader would immediately break off talks with Corbyn.If he wants to do a deal, he needs to DO IT SOON. Which way will he go Well, one of those involved tells me that the situation in the talks is “less negative than people think”. But the likelihood of these talks producing something remains low. What would make a deal attractive to Jeremy Corbyn would make it unpalatable to Theresa May.Another complication is that, as one Cabinet Minister points out, “It’s quite finely balanced that a May Corbyn deal could get through” the Commons as Labour MPs passionately in favour of a second referendum would vote against it, as would Tories who viscerally oppose a customs union.The depressing truth is that there is now a growing risk that the Tory party doesn’t deliver Brexit AND doesn’t stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting to Number . This would be an epic failure.Unless the Tory hold-outs decide to back the existing deal when they come back from their holidays, this danger will become increasingly real.CONSERVATIVE MPs are taking a second look at Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary has more critics on the Tory benches than any other leadership contender.But the party’s precipitous fall in the polls is making Tories reconsider.If they are losing a quarter of their support to pro-Brexit parties, who is better placed to win those voters back than the man who led the Leave campaign  Boris’s campaign is more organised than it was.The arrival of the former MP James Wharton has helped and, as one of those on the team puts it, MPs are now “petried about their seats” and so more prepared to swallow their doubts about Boris.A decade ago, one of those who knows the Tory party best told me that the Tories would only turn to Boris when they were - down with  minutes to go.They now are three down and that means Boris is back in contention for the premiership.MRS MAY might still be in the post. But make no mistake, the Tory leadership contest is under way.We have now even got ministers saying on live TV who they will back when there’s a contest.This week, the Treasury Minister Mel Stride got  or so Tory MPs who want Michael Gove to run for leader together with their potential candidate for drinks.One of those present tells me it is increasingly likely that Gove will run.THE big decision on whether to press ahead with HS has to be taken in December.But with a change of Tory leader likely to happen before then, the project is in trouble.Scrapping the scheme would give any new PM billions to spend on other projects, such as better transport within and between northern cities and proper, digital infrastructure for the whole of the UK.There’ll be no shortage of candidates making this case come a Tory leadership contest.THE six-month Brexit extension is the wrong .It is neither short enough to force MPs to make up their minds about what they want, nor is it long enough to allow for a new Prime Minister and a general election campaign.Emmanuel Macron wanted to give Britain a short extension to force a decision, Angela Merkel favoured one long enough to give the UK time to come up with a new path. In the end, they compromised on this medium- extension.“Two potential routes out and they went to the middle one that delivers us to nowhere,” laments one Cabinet Minister.There is a real danger that the Brexit drt continues for another six months. This useless Parliament knows what it doesn’t want, but can’t say what it would actually accept.If this happens, Britain will end up back at the EU Council in October asking for a THIRD EXTENSION.This would be ridiculous. But one Secretary of State predicts that this is “where we’ll probably end up and at that point Macron’s view will probably prevail”.The French President might be so full of himself that you think he’s going to burst.But he’s right that only a HARD DEADLINE will force our MPs to make up their minds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their mistake became obvious too late.Politicians forever come a cropper with knee-jerk tweets.Like Tory chairman Brandon Lewis demanding Boris Johnson apologise for burka remarks most of Britain then backed.MPs are hooked on it and presumably imagine Britain is too.But political Twitter is a bubble, not the national conversation.A visit to any town or city outside the M would tell them that.And the Tories and Labour might then begin to grasp the white-hot rage felt by millions over the abysmal state of our politics and MPs’ infantile tribal games.WE hope the Tory ERG have a long, hard and sober think over their Easter break.They may want to be remembered as heroic holdouts against a softish Brexit.Butthe decision of .million ­people is overturned, and the Tories are ousted by hard-left extremists who inflict poverty on Britain, it will not be the Remainer MPs history recalls.Fair or not, it will be two dozen ERG members who had the sole viable Brexit deal in their grasp and threw it away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, it’s quite the opposite.For a start, not one recipient seems grateful.But more importantly, we are almost skint ourselves, so not exactly in a position to be flash with our cash.Are you aware that we have to pay £BILLION A YEAR simply in interest, servicing our own debt.So that is before we pay off any of the actual debt.So spending £billion a year on an ill-thought-through and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target seems nonsensical to me.A couple of recent examples of the kind of thing that some foreign aid is spent on once it has been allocated include fixing potholes in Pakistan and India and helping an all-female pop group dubbed the Ethiopian Spice Girls.But another story this week shines even more light on how misguided our foreign aid spending is.Auditors investigating the way £.billion was spent through charities found poor management practices and delays by the Department for International Development, which was described as “dithering”, risked completely wasting the money.The net result is that these foreign aid projects — which spend ten per cent of our aid budget — are “unlikely to achieve lasting change”.So not only are we throwing money we can not afford at a problem that is not ours, that money may as well be flushed away for all the good it is doing.How galling is that  Just to reiterate, we are talking about a whopping £.billion here — not just a few thousand quid.This is enough money to change lives here profoundly and on a very grand scale.But that brings me back to my first point: Why on earth are we giving away such a colossal amount of money when we really are not in a position to do so And it was recently revealed that more than million people in the UK are living in poverty.By the way, that figure includes .million children who are living below the breadline — and suffering badly as a result.More than half of them will not be able to get themselves out of poverty and will find themselves trapped in a cycle that goes on for years, according to a new measure for tracking poverty that has brought together specialists from across the political spectrum.The scary thing is that even a relatively comfortable income is no guarantee that people can meet basic material needs —that income is eaten up by unavoidable weekly outgoings.And this problem is getting worse, not better. By - the proportion of children living in relative povertyis on course to hit  per cent — exceeding the previous record high of  per cent in the early s.This could mean an extra one million children living in poverty in the next five years.In other words, we have a serious problem on our hands.Many people will no doubt blame austerity for the increase in poverty over the past few years. And yes, sure, it is true that the cuts and freezes to welfare and disability benefits have had an impact.But just imagine the ways in which £.billion could begin to make a massive material impact on the lives of poverty-stricken people in this country.I believe that we should reserve some money — a couple of billion, say — for overseas catastrophes, such as tsunamis.But other than that, let’s stop giving away money that could be much, much better spent at home.I KNOW Jeremy Kyle has interviewed some dubious characters over the years, but the biscuit was well and truly taken this week by Georgina Clarke.This -year-old mother is so obsessed with cosmetic surgery that she allowed her daughter Kayla, aged , to dance for, and sleep with, a “sugar daddy” who then paid for both of them to have plastic surgery.Why does an -year-old “need” cosmetic surgery, you may ask.Kayla blamed the pressures of social media, as well as glamorous celebrities such as the Kardashians for making her want bigger boobs and plumped-up lips.But instead of reassuring her daughter that she didn’t need surgery, this mother gave it her blessing.Georgina justied this to Jeremy by saying she found surgery “quite addictive”, and revealed – unsurprisingly –  she is still not happy with her own look.It’s easy to wonder whether that therefore means she’ll be encouraging her daughter to wine, dine and dance for a few more older men.As mothers, we are meant to give our daughters self-esteem and confidence, not encourage them to surgically “improve” themselves.And for a mother to encourage her daughter to fund that surgery, as well as her own, by sleeping with a dirty old man The only explanation is that her moral compass is severely and sadly lacking.I can still remember going to watch Grease when it came out the first time. I got dressed up in a boob tube and skin-tight trouserswhen I was all of nine years old.And I can’t wait to see the prequel, although I probably won’t wear the boob tube this time around.Mind you, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that over the years so... never say never.WE all have moments of fantasising about just how much better le would bewe won the lottery and never had to work again.But for all too many people, realising their wildest dreams with a win turns out to be a le change that’s incompatible with the le they have lived so far.Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Colin and Christine Weir, have turned out to be the latest lottery casualties.This week they announced they’re orcing – eight years after scooping the £million jackpot.Colin, , and Christine, , took home the EuroMillions British record in  and had been married for  years before their recent split.In fact, let’s all take a moment to count our lucky stars that we haven’t won the lottery this week.IT’S hard to believe that Lori Loughlin and her husband could be facing  years in prison and fines of more than a million dollars for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern Calornia.I mean, yes, I know that bribing your child’s way through university is dishonest, dishonourable and not at all admirable.But  years in prison for doing so That does seem a little harsh.Justice has been served and his mum was given a -month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a -day rehabilitation activity.Far worse, though, she has now lost her son, who has been adopted into another family. Thank God for adopters.A judge told the woman – who can’t be identied for legal reasons – that leaving her son in such a state was “reprehensible” and “goes against the instinct of any caring mother”, which is true.Anyone who becomes a parent needs to understand that kids are forever.I speak from experience, by the way – mine are  and  and there’s still no independence in sight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past few weeks the EU has done just that to Theresa May.Only the dference is, we keep being flogged not because we tried to escape the EU but we failed to even TRY to escape.After all, we could have escaped with no deal on March , then again on April  and now we will have to put up with more floggings as we delay our departure until October.In the midst of this humiliating and embarrassing national failure, just when you think it can’t get worse, up pops the Chancellor glibly saying there will be a vote on holding another Brexit referendum and that the Government agree on a lot with Labour.This flies in the face of the fact that, in marginal seats around the country, Conservatives are aghast the Government wants to do a deal with Labour.Remember, this is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which wants a Customs Union, alignment with the EU single market and a second referendum.It’s BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.Worse, Corbyn’s brand of anti-British, Venezuelan-supporting Marxism is the single biggest threat to the UK’s future prosperity.Intriguingly, the Chancellor’s statement contradicts the Government’s previous view. After all, the Prime Minister used to say Corbyn wasn’t fit to be Prime Minister.The negotiating strategy it adopted has been aimed at trying to make an example of the UK to stop other countries thinking of leaving.At the heart of this has been their determination to insist on a deeply damaging set of proposals for the Northern Ireland border.It is these demands which have made it impossible to get a deal through the House of Commons. Those who believe in the importance of the union of the United Kingdom recognise the need to stand up for the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The EU’s arrogant refusal to continue negotiating a better way forward, using alternative border arrangements, is a deliberate attempt to interfere in the nature of the UK.In this they are supported by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose somewhat pompous elitism is in stark contrast to his poll ratings — which have been so low you could slide them under a snake.Instead of confronting the EU, prepared to leave by rejecting its deal, the Prime Minister has instead taken a dangerous decision.This is to agree to the EU demand for a longer extension, up to October  — a further  days of membership.This isn’t just a delay until October, it comes with strings attached. The EU demands that we fight next month’s Euro elections.This will be an utter disaster.At a cost to taxpayers of more than £million, and around £billion each month in EU membership fees, we would elect MEP’s who would have to leave office when we leave the EU in October.These will be elections no one really wants and would go down in history as the most pointless and expensive electoral mistake.There was a time when the Prime Minister had the sympathy of the nation. People used to give her the benefit of the doubt.They recognised that in a Parliament stuffed with an overwhelming majority of anti-Brexit Remainers, and with a Remain-leaning Cabinet, it was dficult for her.Most people I have spoken to hung on to the pledge the PM made to leave the EU on March .They remembered her constant refrain that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and persuaded themselves such a pledge would be delivered on.That all changed when we didn’t leave on March . Gone is that sense of sympathy and trust and in its place is a growing sense of betrayal. The country is crying out for strong leadership.Yet it is not too late. We can, even at this eleventh hour, rediscover our belief in the UK as a self-governing nation, the world’s fth largest economy and one of the most influential.After all, despite all the Project Fear warnings, while the Eurozone is mostly in recession the UK’s economy is growing, employment is at a record high and youth unemployment at a near-record low.No, we don’t need to fear anything.The Prime Minister has already said she is stepping down. She needs to heed the concerns, including those of her MPs, and not let this drag out.What better legacy than one where she recognises the optimism of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.They instinctively know that our best days are ahead of us. Now is the time to refuse to be bullied by the EU any more — no more national humiliation.If the EU won’t change their deal, she should say the UK will simply leave.Now that’s a great legacy, Prime Minister. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is she going to have a customs union or not “Nothing is going to happen of any serious substance until she can give us an answer to that.”The customs union dilemma is threatening to split the Tory party in two.A series of Remain-leaning ministers have urged the PM to abandon the party manesto pledge and sign up to one to get Brexit over the line after Britain’s exit date was pushed back by another six months last week.But Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have insisted it would be a bitter betrayal of the referendum result and strip Britain of any independent trade policy.Jeremy Hunt urged Mrs May on Monday to think about healing her bitter Brexit rt with the DUP instead.The Foreign Secretary became the first Cabinet minister to cast serious public doubt on any success of talks with Labour, as other senior Tories suspect Labour just wants to wind down the clock.Mr Hunt said: “We don’t knowthey’re going to work and it may be we need to find a way to rebuild the Conservative DUP coalition”.Mrs May and husband Philip – on the six day walking holiday until Thursday – were spotted on the way to Wales on Saturday when they stopped at a Welcome Break service station on the M in Shropshire.Meanwhile Mrs May faced fresh criticism of her handling of Brexit Monday night as ex-Tory minister Nick Boles accused her of making a “moral error” by pursuing a “hardline” approach.The MP, who dramatically quit the Tories earlier this month in protest at his party’s refusal to compromise on Brexit, said she had failed as PM because she had tried to be “more Brexiter than thou”.Mr Boles told the House magazine: “She persuaded herself she needed to be more Brexity than Brexiters.“It was a massive, not just a miscalculation, but a moral error. One that has come to determine and define everything that’s happened since.”Jeremy Corbyn was left high and dry on Monday – as he was snapped in a canoe not in water.He donned a le jacket and helmet for the bizarre photocall, but failed to launch himself into the lake.As he grinned for the cameras, Brexit talks between Labour and the Government were also going nowhere fast as two sides did not both meeting.Ministers said they would hold a third week of national unity talks with Labour as they insist they are trying to thrash out a deal.But both sides have not met since last Friday.Mr Corbyn – who is aiming for No – also tried his hand at a spot of archery as he visited the outdoor activity centre in Yorkshire.But the  year-old missed his target and sent the arrow flying into the net behind. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule.

But Joeaposs grief-stricken sister Ria Ulleri, who helped care for her brother, called his death cruel and horric.Speaking for the first time since her loss, the -year-old actress told Manchester Evening News : Joe was a sweet and funny man, but he needed support. It is tragic that the people he relied on to care for him were the ones who let him down.   It wasn’t until the inquest that we learned just how much Joe had been neglected. It was horric. It seemed so cruel. The manaposs weight dropped from kg to just kg and despite his desperate pleas from family and friends, he continued to deteriorate. All through Joe’s le, we had fought for him to be included, and treated with respect. Yet at the very end, he was failed by the people who were supposed to look after him, Ria, who now lives in London, added. Giuseppe, known as Joe, was the eldest of four children. Their mother died when they were little and they were raised by their father, Pietro. Recalling her childhood, Ria said: Growing up, we knew there was something dferent about Joe, but we took it all in our stride. He couldn’t really talk much, but he made himself understood no problem.  He was really funny and entertaining and we were very close. Our parents were Sardinian and Joe loved to dance to Sardinian music. He liked gardening too.    There was pressure from the doctors for Joe to go into residential care, but my dad wouldn’t hear of it. Joe was part of the family and that’s just how it was.     Ria was later diagnosed with MS and her health suffered. Her father also suffered from ill-health in old age and in  it was decided Joe would move into supported living with L’Arche Manchester, which supports people living with learning disabilities. She continued: The move gave Joe independence and it gave my dad some respite so it was better for everyone, although it was a dficult decision. He liked it there and the staff were fantastic.  In February , Joe had a fall at his new home and was taken to hospital, with fractures to his pelvis, wrist and neck.     He was found, after his death, to have undiagnosed osteoporosis.     His family – Ria, and brothers Peter and Gio, a respected documentary film maker - were told he needed surgery and as he had dficulty swallowing, with his neck fracture, he was made aposnil by mouthapos. Ria added: I visited Joe in hospital and he wasn’t happy at all. He hated being in there. But I just thought it was a fall and that he’d soon be home again.  I had no idea what lay ahead. When I left, he held my hands and he wouldn’t let go. Looking back, it was ashe knew. Two weeks on, doctors told Ria that Joe was dying.  She said: I held him in my arms and I said goodbye as he took his last breath. My heart was breaking. He had lost so much weight. He was a shadow of himself. He died on March , , while medics were still debating how best to feed him.  His cause of death was given as insufficient nutrition, osteopathic fractures, and pneumonia. Joe was cremated at his local church, where his family played his favourite song Always Look On The Bright Side Of Le.  The inquest earlier this month a inquest jury recorded a narrative conclusion and cited an aposoverall failure of careapos and a aposfailure to provide adequate nutritionapos which aposconstituted neglectapos. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust apologised and said it has implemented aposmeasures to ensure that this does not happen againapos.  The trust said it has aposundertaken extensive work on nutrition and hydration and aposfocused on how we care for our patients who have a learning disabilityapos.

Charlotte Dubard was asked by her boyfriendsheaposd found a baby in the street after he had ed home from work to find she had given birth. Charlotte, , had no idea she was due to have a baby despite suddenly craving sugar and gaining around lbs in weight. But in January she felt a series of sudden abdominal pains while at home so decided to investigate with her iPhone camera. She took a video and was stunned to see her babyaposs hair.    The graduate - who was a size eight to ten throughout her pregnancy - allowed instinct to take over as she gave birth in the bath. Baby Elias was born at a healthy lbs oz on January . Brave Charlotte underwent the excruciating experience all alone and without the aid of painkillers. She then found a pair of nail scissors to slice her umbilical cord before ringing boyfriend Miguel Angel, , telling him he needed to come home urgently. He dashed back from is job at Pret-a-Manger to the coupleaposs flat they share in Bow, east London. But she said: When Miguel came home, he screamed aposOh my god you found a baby in the streetapos!    Charlotte said it took ages for him to believe the child was his. I started bawling and said aposThis is oursapos, she said. He was in shock. Neither of us could believe it was ours, she said. It was the most mysterious thing, I obviously gained a little bit of weight but nowhere near enough to make me think I could be pregnant. In hindsight, I was craving a lot of sugar and I did also have a problem with my leg which meant I had to be off work for a week. The doctor said that was probably the pressure from the baby. One evening, I started to get cramps but they were really quite mild - milder than my usual period pains. Then the next day they continued and they kept coming and going in waves which I now realise were my contractions.  Little Elias was immediately taken to the hospital after his surprise birth and put in intensive care for thorough checks. Charlotte said: It was only once we got to the hospital that I really registered what had happened. I was so traumatised from the birth I had barely registered Elias at all. But then when we were waiting for the doctor, Miguel said aposLook he has your noseapos and thataposs when I suddenly realised he was ours.  The -year-old - a waitress at Somerset House - added that she feels incredibly lucky to have such a healthy baby despite smoking, drinking and working  hour days throughout her pregnancy. She also continued taking the contraceptive pill while pregnant and claims her periods remained normal during those nine months. She said: I call him my miracle baby because he is so healthy after all I put him through. Also, so many things could have gone wrong with me giving birth alone but it all went remarkably smoothly. The midwives even asked me how I knew where to cut the umbilical cord becauseI had done it wrong it could have been so dangerous. I have no idea how I knew exactly what to do, I guess instinct took over.  Charlotte didnapost even tell her mum straight away. She said: I actually didnapost tell her right away because she was working and I knew she wouldnapost be able to finish her shtI told her. I waited until the next day and she was so shocked. Charlotte and Pret A Manger worker Miguel met on dating app Happn in the capital just under three years ago. Though she said she was usually very careful at taking the contraceptive pill, she recalled two occasions when she forgot to take it around the time Elias was presumably conceived. The student couple planned to move to the US but are now staying put.  She credits her family for making the transition into motherhood so easily. She said: I actually didnapost tell my mum right away because she was working and I knew she wouldnapost be able to finish her shtI told her. I waited until the next day and she was so shocked. But my family have been so supportive, theyaposre very strict Catholics and they see Elias as a miracle. My grandmother says he is a little angel. Rare, symptomless pregnancies are a recognised phenomenon. Back in , the Royal College of Midwives estimated they accounted for around one in , cases in the UK. This translates as  cases each year of women not knowing they were pregnant.  Charlotteaposs mother has set up a GoFundMe account so kind strangers can donate to help the new parents adjust.

He only realised the truth a week later when friends showed him a viral video of the attack which was circulating online, TV reports. His outraged father shared the clip on social media yesterday in an effort to track the down the thug and the laughing cameraman.  Hours later, police revealed they had identied the pair and would be questioning them this week - after the attacker reportedly handed himself in. The disturbing clip shows the lone victim stood looking down at his mobile phone as the attacker casually approaches outside a -Eleven store in Stavanger, Norway, last Saturday.

Shortly after the blaze began President Donald Trump tweeted his suggestions of how firefighters could tackle the blaze. He wrote: So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly.    But authorities are unable to drop water from the cathedral from the air, for fear of destroying what is left of Notre Dame and injuring people nearby. Explaining why this approach hasnapost been used, Le Monde explains: A Canadair projects about  tonnes of water at high speed to the ground: the danger is signicant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas. Such an intervention could also signicantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.    It also pointed out that the pilot would be criminally responsible for the consequences of dropping water on the cathedral. While authorities are still investigating the cause of the blaze, a ‘aposstray flameapos linked to £million renovation work is thought to have sparked the inferno in the loft at around .pm. Crowds of aghast Parisiennes and tourists are watching from the bridges and banks of the River Seine as emergency services try desperately to save the medieval building and the priceless works of art at its heart.    Devastating footage earlier captured the moments the spire of one of Parisapos most recognisable landmarks collapsing as the church is ravaged by the blazing inferno.

by the Hoops at the national stadium as their hopes of lting the Scottish Cup for the first time since  were abruptly ended.Dom Ball was first to be sent off near the end of the first half.The Rotherham loanee collected a second yellow card following a clash of heads with former Red Ryan Christie, after a harsh booking for a trip on former Don Jonny Hayes.In the six minutes of injury-time at the end of the first period – added because of Christie’s treatment – James Forrest fired Celtic in front.Just after the hour Odsonne Edouard’s penalty made it - and then referee Craig Thomson gave Lewis Ferguson a straight red card for a two-footed lunge on Tom Rogic.Dons boss Derek McInnes and assistant Tony Docherty were also sent off – with McInnes dismissed after Rogic netted the Hoops’ third.Striker Cosgrove was disappointed that the red cards for Ball and Ferguson suffocated any hopes of Aberdeen mounting a second-half comeback.The Englishman, , said: “The first emotion that comes to mind is frustration and then annoyance.“We came to Hampden knowing it was going to be a tough day and I’m sure Celtic expected the same. But when we go down to nine men, especially at two goals behind, it was always going to be a tough task.“We knew it would be a tough game with  men on the park.“I felt the gameplan was going pretty well up until the first sending off. We had frustrated Celtic, it was five minutes to half-time and then to get a man sent off and lose a goal was extremely frustrating.“I thought Dom’s first yellow was harsh and could have been waved on. There were a few challenges going around in the game and it wasn’t a persistent foul – it was a harsh yellow. The second one was an incident which can go either way.“They both collided and Ryan has come off worse – firstly I hope Ryan is all right. But it was harsh overall on Dom.“And it’s just a rush of blood to the head from Lewis. You can’t say ‘fair enough it’s happened’ but you can understand.“Sometimes emotions get the better of you. It was a very frustrating day for Lewis and that topped it off.”McInnes was dismissed for making a gesture at the Celtic support in response to a sectarian chant being aimed at him from the stands.No Docherty was sent off for remarks made to ref Thomson at half-time.Cosgrove was unaware of what had happened with McInnes’ sending-off and added: “I’ve not got a clue what happened with it. I heard that Tony Docherty maybe got sent off at half-time.“But I don’t know what  happened. In these games you definitely need the rub of the green and we don’t feel like we got that.”All the Dons have left to play for this term is a Europa League qualying spot.They trail Kilmarnock on goal dference in the battle for third but Cosgrove has backed them to finish strongly in the Premiership and secure Europe for the sixth straight season.The -goal hitman said: “There was a lot of annoyance and frustration throughout the dressing room at the end.“The whole city and club had hopes going into the game and they’ve come crashing down in very annoying fashion. But we’ve got to dust ourselves down for the rest of the season.“It won’t be too hard to rally because it’s a great bunch of lads in the squad.“We’ve got to have some time to reflect on this and we will be disappointed. We will definitely come back, though, and we’ll be back strongly on Saturday.“The spirit in the squad will be important and there’s no doubt it will be there.“We do need a bit of time to reflect and be disappointed. But when we’re back training we’ll be up for it and the games coming up.“It’s now about getting as many points as we can from the remaining games to get the points we need to secure third place.“We don’t want to let the season peter out and not qualy for Europe.“And we are still right in among it and we’re very focused and determined to get into Europe.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42352479-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42352479-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42352479-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42352479-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen shop applies for permission to sell hot food","story":"A -hour convenience store in Aberdeen has applied for permission to sell hot food.The LM Convenience Store on the corner of Hutcheon Street and Holland Street has submitted a change of use application to Aberdeen City Council.Planning documents stated: “The proposed change of use is to allow the current owner of the convenience store to serve freshly cooked snacks supplementing the current cold and pre-warmed foods available, this is by way of a small oven with integral catalytic filter removing the need for an external flue to be sited in the new prep area.”The proposals added: “There is, however, a requirement for air extract from the prep area to alleviate the potential for hot air build up due to the siting of the plant to this area this will be via a high-level wall mounted extract fan utilising a pre-existing duct currently concealed by the shop front fascia.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb074a2914bc2.84707839.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet pepper monkey and shadow are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This timid girl takes time to get to know and trust new people.But Pepper loves treats and this will help a new owner bring her out her shell and build up some trust as she has a sweet nature just waiting to get out.She will need a quiet home with an owner who has the time and patience to help her find her confidence.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"young argyll players make their mark in shinty finals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnthusiastic crowds looked on as the  National First Shinty Championships were held across two Fort William venues.The GS Campbell finals on Saturday February  brought together more than  of the best young players from across Scotland, all vying for the coveted national P and P titles.The P and under tournament was played at the Nevis Centre and the standard of play throughout the day was of the highest order with all  teams giving a great account of themselves.Section A saw Aberdour edge out a classy Strachur Kyles side on goal dference to clinch second spot.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields south ayrshrie council","story":"NewsBob Shields: South Ayrshrie Council need new plan to build hundreds of homesRiiverside flats face being pulled downShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’ve dominated Ayr’s skyline for exactly half a century. They’re aesthetically unappealing, architecturally worthless and my three year old grandson could probably knock up an exact replica in Lego while his left hand was peeling the foil off his Easter egg. Carbuncles, eyesores, blots on the landscape - you can call them what you like. But for a couple of hundred people at least . . . it’s the place that they call ‘home’. Last week, South Ayrshire Council started the first phase of what could end in the demolition of Ayr’s trident of riverside flats. Officials began door knocking at Riverside Place as part of the promised consultation with the remaining residents to help decide whether the flats should be renovated . . . or simply razed to the ground. By all accounts – including my dear old  year old dad – the housing staff were considerate and sympathetic while listening to everyone’s point of view. And while the many senior citizens at Riverside didn’t exactly link their arms defiantly and chant “We shall not be moved” – they left the consultants with a similar but equally strong message - “We don’t want to be moved . . .” This leaves South Ayrshire Council between three, fourteen storey blocks – and a hard place. The flats all need “core” work to their internal cladding which has reached “the end of its design le”. To simply ignore the advice of the independent structural engineers isn’t an option. In this post-Grenfell era, the words “cladding” and “tower block” make even the pencils on a health and safety officer’s desk stand to attention. But with an estimated price tag of £ million for the renovations, South Ayrshire Council must balance whether saving Riverside Place is best value compared to simply knocking them down and starting a new-build site. They next conundrum for SAC is then the poser – is best value always best practice  Re-housing – and I mean satisfactorily re-housing – what is likely to be at least  people is a decant operation of Normandy proportions. Personally, I don’t think old Bob Snr is physically or mentally equipped to be transferred anywhere. And there must be dozens - or even scores - just like him at Riverside Place. A good place for SAC to start would be to put hundreds of minds at rest and pledge ‘no compulsory transfers’ out of Riverside Place. And after that . . . work out how the heck they can achieve it! Getting the number of tenants down to  – enough to fill two blocks – would be my starting point. Decanting from one block to a similar flat in another is the least intrusive option. I don’t like the phrase ‘natural wastage’ – but it can’t be ignored. Like anywhere  in the world, Riverside Place will have its share of residents who pass on to a much higher level than fourteen floors. I’ve also spoken to several residents who would seriously consider a temporary move to other parts of Ayr – in exchange for a ‘rent free’ package. Yep – it’s called bribery . . . but it could work. And it would mean work do be done to one block at a time – with residents moving between the two that are habitable. However,the final decision is to demolish Riverside Place, it’s a whole new ball game. Butthis really is the ‘pivotal point for Ayr town centre’ that everyone is talking about – it’s the ideal time for SAC to come up with a new local authority housing plan to build hundreds of new homes over the next few years. And finally, let’s not forget the third option. Empty the flats . . . surround them in scaffolding . . . cover them in white plastic . . . and forget about them!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"coral scottish grand national festival","story":"NewsCoral Scottish Grand National Festival set to welcome thousands to AyrMore than , race fans will attend the track over the course of the two day festival.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsRace fans are set for a great time at Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe stage is set for Ayr’s busiest weekend of  – the Coral Scottish Grand National Festival, writes Iain Ferguson.

The figure emerged the same week the Scottish Police Federation staged its annual conference at Turnberry Hotel. Tory John Scott MSP has called on the SNP to deflect funding into putting more police in Ayrshire. He: “We should all recognise the professional job done by police officers in what are undoubtedly extremely challenging circumstances, but the reality is that job is made much harder by the lack of adequate resources . At the Scottish Police Federation’s annual conference held at Turnberry, the concern was that there was just not enough officers on the frontline. It’s clear the Scottish Government needs to give our police a greater share of resources, so they can do the job of keeping us all safe.” The survey asked Ayrshire peopletheir local bobbies patrol on foot - and only . per cent said yes.

The public have been advised to stay away from the area and nearby residents should keep their windows closed. Crews are working alongside the Forestry Commission and Police Scotland and will remain on scene until the area is made safe. A rest and welfare facility has been established in the community centre in Dalmellington for any local residents affected by the fire. Assistant Chief Officer for Response and Resilience Lewis Ramsay said: “Our crews across Scotland have had a challenging weekend attending numerous incidents. “Due to the outstanding collaborative working with land owners, The Forestry Commission and Police Scotland we have been able to ensure the safety of our communities. “I would like to thank the wider community for their ongoing support, the hard work of our partners, and the crews on the ground for their tireless efforts.” Firefighters are also still in attendance at a wildfire at Paul’s Hill wind farm near Aberlour. A number of fire engines were mobilised to the area after the call came in at .pm on Saturday, April . A wildfire warning was issued in conjunction with the Scottish Wildfire Forum for this weekend. Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended.They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildle and threaten the welfare of nearby communities - swallowing up emergency service resources. SFRS Area Manager Bruce Farquharson is the chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum. He said: We saw last year the devastating effect wildfires can have on communities and wildle. The dry and warm weather we are currently experiencing means there is a heightened risk of wildfire across the country. Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause signicant environmental and economic damage. Livestock, farmland, wildle, protected woodland and sites of special scientic interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The SFRS works closely with land managers, communities and other safety partners to prevent these incidents ever occurring. Area Manager Farquharson continued: At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation leftover from last year - this fuel can dry out quickly with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels. A great many people will be enjoying the outdoors in the good weather this weekend, we urge everyone to make sure that they don’t increase the chance of wildfire – be aware of the risks and follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Wildfires are a major threat to our wildle and wild places. We encourage people visiting the outdoors to be extra careful, and check the advice in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code before starting a fire. The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

portion of the Tweedbank masterplan is ldquounviable and undeliverable and that ldquoit is quite clear that what is proposed is over-development of the site.The damning report, commissioned by Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound. million in December .Once costs of borrowing and other fees have been factored in, the purchase will cost SBC around pound million and forms parts of its wider plan to address a regional housing shortfall of some  units.The Lowood site has been earmarked for around  properties, however the JLL report suggests that the development is unlikely to yield any financial gain.The report claims: ldquoOur conclusion is that there would be insufficient revenue to generate either a developerrsquos profit or a positive land value.In addition to questioning the economic viability of the development, the JLL report raises concerns that ldquothe level of development and infrastructure proposed would seriously harm the environment and the River Tweed interests from a physical and

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9367886.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"eight-councils-allocate-66m-for-redevelopment-of-former-ravenscraig-steelworks-site","story":"The eight councils involved have agreed to allocate an additional pound million for the Ravenscraig Infrastructure Accessproject.City Deal cash, along with an additional pound. million from North Lanarkshire Council, will be used to upgrade roads from the M at Motherwell through Ravenscraig to the M at Eurocentral and onward past Airdrie on a new link road to the A south of Cumbernauld.The transport infrastructure project, part of the wider Pan-Lanarkshire Orbital Corridor, is vital to the overall development of the Ravenscraig site, according to councillors.They estimate the revised proposals for redeveloping Ravenscraig could create more than , jobs and boost the economy by pound million a year.: The Glasgow City Council staff paid more than pound, last yearAt  hectares, Ravenscraig is one of Europes largest brownfield regeneration sites and accounts for % of the Glasgow City Regions vacant and derelict land.Ravencraig Ltds new masterplan for the area will be considered by the council in the coming weeks and includes proposals for , houses, five primary schools, a town park and more than ,sq m of office, industrial and retail space.Paul Kelly, depute leader of North Lanarkshire Council, said: \"The regeneration of Ravencraig is of major strategic and economic importance to North Lanarkshire and the wider area.\"The pound million Pan-Lanarkshire Orbital project represents the biggest single roads and infrastructure investment in North Lanarkshires history, and our focus must be on those projects that will attract investment to the area and be of the greatest economic benefit to our communities.\"Channelling our resources into creating a first-class infrastructure at Ravenscraig will bolster future investment from the private sector to create homes, businesses and job opportunities - potentially creating , jobs and generating pound million in Gross Value Addedfor the local economy.\"Its vital that we focus on those projects that offer the beston investment for our communities, our economy and for the future of North Lanarkshire.\"Speaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland, Mr Kelly added: \"Theres been huge delays over the years but I really feel today is a historic day - its the biggest investment well ever see in our infrastructure and it will lead to the transformation of the Ravenscraig site.\"Over the last two years we have been driving this as best we can to try to transform it and to deliver on what the people of Motherwell and the wider area want on the site.\"Scottish Secretary David Mundell, said: \"This is very welcome news and it is great to see good progress being made to the Glasgow City Region Deal.For all your breaking Glasgow news, click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages\"The UK Government has committed more than pound million to the deal with an ambitious goal of creating jobs and opportunities and stimulating long-lasting growth for local communities.\"This project has the potential to transform Ravenscraig and will help to attract signicant private sector investment to bring new homes and businesses to the site.\"The UK Government is funding vital projects right across Scotland and to date have committed more than pound. billion to City Region and Growth Deals.\"Scottish Government Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The Scottish Government has committed to invest pound million in the Glasgow City Region Deal in pursuit of long-term, sustainable economic growth.\"I am pleased to see North Lanarkshire Council and the wider Glasgow City Region continue to drive this deal forward and work together in the best interests of the regional economy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  As May goes down for the third time  the road to Brexit just got a whole lot longer","story":"The Prime Minister has behaved asshe had a thumping Commons majority when in fact she is a minority leader of an unstable coalition. Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge.

We still have Mr Lakin postulating that breaking from the EU will boost our international competitiveness, against every other single global estimate. The basis for his sage forecast is a tweet from the President of the United States. That is where we are today. Wersquore breaking from the worlds largest trading block on the back of a -character comment on social media, from Donald Trump no less.Itrsquos then backed up by saying the UK grew . per cent and . per cent industrially in February versus forecasted German stagnation. The fact that Germany exports more than it imports while the UK imports more than it exports might be a factor here.Based on my professional experience in manufacturing I can guarantee that any uptick in the UK economy is purely to down to front-loading of manufacturing for the impending shock of Brexit. The next stage, evenwe do not exit, will be a surprise contraction in manufacturing output as stock levels have soared this is unavoidable now as the process has started. The supply channels and warehouses are full. The more subtle impacts of wasted commercial investment in Brexit mitigation will echo through businesses for a long long time. The lost jobs down to business migration to the EU are gone forever. Thankfully this will probably peter out now.Irsquom not sure where Mr Lakin was in the early s after we soared like an eagle out of the three-day week, miners strike, power strikes, lorry driver strikes and pound devaluation. I can say with great certainty no one was soaring in Clydebank. We had unemployment at levels unseen since before the war. My own father was unemployed for eight years without break. The whole country was affected, whole families devastated.I have always said from the start that once the realities of Brexit were felt that you will be hard pushed to find anyone who will admit supporting this nonsense. That wave has now begun. We can be thankful for cooler heads in Westminster, some very lucky parliamentary arithmetic and to our great friends in the EU for helping us avoid a national catastrophe. My advice to Mr Lakin would be learn the lesson, be happy that cooler heads and smarter people like Donald Tusk have helped us avoid a national disaster.Donrsquot double down on your madness, it will just take the whole embarrassment of it a lot longer for it to be forgotten.Campbell Grant Kennedy,Kuehlergrund -, Heidelberg , Germany.IAN Lakin declares that the fact of the UK wishing to leave the EU is the fault of the EU, and the subsequent toing and froing of Theresa May is also its fault. He does not seem to have noticed that Mrs May cannot get the support from the Westminster Parliament to justy her actions.Britain wants the EU to change the rules, then leave the EU. It would be a very strange club where rules were changed by departing members it could also be that Mr Lakin does not wish to see the EU receive any money for the disruption caused by the UK.He based his view on how we survived the s, the minersrsquo strike and the three-day week perhaps the political parties were a wee bit better than we see today ndash Mrs Thatcher did not come along until .He quotes President Trump as an example in trading to be admired any support for a politician who wants another country to build a wall, with its money, and who splits families up in pursuit of that aim, is not one anyone should wish to emulate.Mr Lakin calls the EU a spent force, while the  members of the EU are laughing at the UK.Jim Lynch, Corstorphine Hill Crescent, Edinburgh.Read more: European elections : Why is the UK involved and what does it mean for Brexit IAIN Macwhirter, writing on Scotlandrsquos behalf not to the EU, our alleged trading partner, but to the  nation states among whom we do actually trade, condescends to explain to these countries the meaning of sovereignty in a modern world .Oddly enough his is just the sophisticated reasoning employed by the mandarins of Whitehall in their infamous secret memorandum ldquoSovereignty and the European Communities in which they referred to the loss of sovereignty in both foreign and domestic affairs that membership involved.

Does Mr Macwhirter know how many hundreds of thousands have been added in the last  years or how very few areas of our lives are now left free from EU control Notable among the instructions contained in this paper is the reminder of absolute confidentiality during the following  years. The sanguine assumption by Whitehall and presumption by the seminal EU was that after  years Britain would be so enmeshed in Brussels legislation that it would be virtually impossible to leave.Politicians and the media have been carefulnot to attribute unpopular laws to the European Commission, Lord Kerr has introduced a totally unnecessary Article to the EU Constitution and Tony Blairrsquos most brilliant propagandist has been devoting his activities since the referendum to keeping Britain in the EU.But a treaty can always be unilaterally abrogated and , as Mr Macwhirter claims, ldquowe realise that we have become a laughing stock across Europe, we may as well go ahead and earn its execration also by making a clean break and facing the consequences.Above all we must campaign for parliamentary representatives to acquaint themselves with at least some of the main themes of the European project and to consider Britainrsquos independence alongside our GDP.

said his party would reintroduce collective pay bargaining across broad swathes of business andit formed the next government at Holyrood.Setting out an industrial strategy at the STUC congress in

compulsory for contractors.Some of theplans envisaged a post-Brexit world, confirmation that he continues to support leaving the EU, despite almost two-thirds of Scots backing Remain in .His plans would also require the consent of the UK government.The SNP said it welcomed support for devolving employment law, but said it was bizarre that Mr Leonard was backing a Brexit which could ldquolay waste to Scottish jobs.The Tories said Labours plans were a recipe for higher taxes.Mr Leonardrsquos conversion to devolved employment law comes after the SNP repeatedly attacked him for complaining about bad employers while leaving decisions to Westminster.The STUC has also called for the devolution of employment law for many years.It is devolved in Northern Ireland, but it is the same in England, Wales and Scotland.In the wake of the  independence referendum, the Smith Commission on greater devolution rejected calls to move responsibility from Westminster to Holyrood.It said there was a risk of a ldquorace to the bottom on worker protection, potentially resulting in the reversal of great advances for workersrsquo rights.In his speech to the opening day of the Congress, Mr Leonard said he would avoid that by guaranteeing there was no loss of existing rights.He said: ldquoWe will protect and strengthen workersrsquo rights by seeking the devolution of employment law in which we

is to lead a Scottish Labour Government worthy of the name.ldquoCommitted to bringing about a real sht in power and wealth including an extension of industrial and economic democracy.He said Scottish

rather than leaving it to the market.Sectoral bargaining could also see the end of zero-hours contracts.In , around  per cent of UK workers were covered by collectively bargained terms, but that is now down to %, compared to a Europe-wide average of %.Mr Leonard said: ldquoA future Scottish Labour Government under my leadership will not only establish sectoral collective bargaining we will establish sectoral industrial and economic planning as well as part of a long overdue industrial strategy for Scotland: bringing together trade unions, employers and government.He said Labour would also make good employment practice - and trade union rights - a condition of qualying for public contracts and grants.He said: ldquoWe will stand on a manesto in  that makes the real living wage and labour standards, including trade union rights not a voluntary arrangement or an optional extra in public procurement and public assistanceldquoWe will make it a compulsory requirement and an

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But thousands of years after they were painstakingly raised, scientists have shed light on the secrets long guarded by Scotland’s megaliths. : Paris’s Notre-Dame Cathedral suffers “colossal damages” in infernoA new study has revealed how the ancient structures were integral to “tightly knit” Neolithic societies, serving as the final resting places for the dead. In what has been described as a “surprising” breakthrough, one tomb analysed by an international team of researchers contained the remains of more than ten generations of the one family. : Runaway ‘Road Runner’ emu filmed speeding along Highland roadThe study, led by Uppsala University in Sweden, suggests that the megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north-western Europe, and were not simply used to bury unrelated members of groups. The scientists analysed human remains from tombs across Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientic community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknownBut by sequencing and analysing the genomes taken from the bones and teeth of  iniduals from five burial sites, the researchers were able to gain an insight into their way of le. The genomic data from the remains, which were radiocarbon dated to between ,BC and ,BC, was then compared to the genetic iation of Stone Age groups and iniduals from other parts of Europe.It showed that the iniduals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.What left the scientists taken aback, however, was the revelation that those buried in the megaliths were closely related. Two tombs in Ireland situated a little over a mile apart contained the remains of parents and their offsprings, while other tombs contained multiple generations of families. Dr Federico Sanchez-Quintom, a population geneticist at Uppsala University and one of the co-authors of the study, said: “This came as a surprise. It appears as though these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.” While the research found that the majority of those buried in the megaliths were men, the tombs also contained the remains of related women.Dr Helena Malmström, an archeogeneticist at the university, explained: “We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again. “However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials, as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.” Those behind the study, published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say more work needs to be done to determine whether the patterns are unique to the analysed tombs, or reflect a more general trend for megalith burials.Scotland is home to some of the best preserved Neolithic tombs in Europe, such as the Maeshowe chambered cairn in Stenness in Orkney. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame inferno a history of paris s most visited landmark","story":"Firefighters are tackling a major blaze at the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.One of the city’s oldest and most recognisable buildings, work began on Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral in .: Paris’s Notre-Dame Cathedral suffers “colossal damages” in infernoThe original structure was completed nearly  years later, in , and its name literally translates to “Our Lady of Paris”.Some  million people now visit the Catholic landmark every year - more than , every day on average - according to its official website, and it is believed to be the most visited structure in the French capital.The first stone of the original structure was laid in front of Pope Alexander III after the Bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, proposed the cathedral after his election in .It grew iconic in popular culture through several artistic works, including the Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which was published in  and adapted by Disney in .The cathedral also houses a beehive over the sacristy, which was added in spring .For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith the brexit party should not be written off in scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Brexit Party has launched, and all the evidence suggests it shall complete a successful mission to change our political constellation # but will it land with any Scottish MEPs The tendency in Scotland is to write off sympathy for Brexit but, just as I warned in this column five years ago, there is a substantial eurosceptic minority looking for a voice.

What had been a trickle of dissent over first, the Prime Minister’s Chequers betrayal and then her surrender by way of the EU’s Withdrawal Agreement, became a torrent of protests when the UK did not leave the EU on  March as promised incessantly by Theresa May.Over a hundredConservative council candidates and Tory association chairmen have written to the press warning of what could become an existential shock to the party’s actual survival. Social media is full of Tweets and posts about supporters never voting Conservative again so long as Theresa May is leader and the party does not honour its commitment to deliver Brexit.The latest UK polling for the European Parliament elections makes shocking reading for Theresa May’s Conservative Party. A YouGov survey shows Labour ahead on  per cent with Conservatives on  per cent and the Brexit Party – even before it had officially launched on  per cent. Ukip is below on  per cent and the Liberal Democrats slipping to  per cent, and the Independent Group formed of Remain defectors from the Labour and Conservativeson  per cent. SNP Plaid Cymru polled  per cent.One opinion survey is, however, only a snapshot further evidence is necessary to identy trends that suggest a credible consistency in support. Unfortunately for the Conservatives a second poll by Opinium provided that the day after with again Labour firstand Conservatives second– with Ukip thirdand the Brexit Party already fourth . The Liberal Democrats came in at  per cent, Greens and SNP both  per cent and Change UK on  per cent.I expect the freshness of the Brexit Party and the pulling power of its charismatic yet Marmite leader Nigel Farage to help it grow, to the cost of Ukip support. Candidates will be important, but the trend is highly likely for the Brexit Party to take over where Ukip has left off.Importantly, note how in both pollsthe support for Ukip and Brexit Party are put together it is larger than that of the Conservatives, totalling  per cent in YouGov and  per cent in Opinium. The Tories are in dire trouble, with still five weeks to go this can only get worse for Theresa May. The Daily , the unofficial organ of Conservative sentiment is railing against May and urging leadership regime change, while two former Chairmen of the backbench  Committee say the rules to depose the leader can easily be altered.Despite all the foregoing, Scotland is dferent. In the UK referendum the majority of Scottish voters chose Remain and the Scottish Conservative Party has reflected this, with its Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, and Scottish Secretary in May’s Cabinet, David Mundell, both devout uber Remainers. Initially, three of the  Scottish Tory MPs sided against the Withdrawal Agreement but that reduced by the time of the third vote. Without an elected figurehead to rally around, and conscious of the need to continue the revival of the party in Scotland any display of recalcitrance in the ranks is also scarce.But wait, there was a City of Edinburgh Council by-election in Leith last week that might suggest all is not well with Conservative voters,not party activists. The Tories talked their chances up, using a hard-working candidate and their good performance in the  council elections to justy the bold claim that only they could beat the SNP. In the end their man came an embarrassing fourth with . per cent of the vote– but more importantly suffered a . per cent drop in support. Could the levee be about to break  It’s hard to be certain, for strong local issues over trams and housing development had recently been in play, causing Labour to lose their last Leith councillor and come third to the SNP winner and Green runner up, both of whom increased their vote share. But the Tories were surprised by their reversal.Beyond scooping-up previous Scottish Ukip votes and disillusioned Conservatives there is a not insubstantial group of SNP voters who voted for Leave in the EU referendum. Ashcroft polling estimated some  per cent of the SNP support back in  got behind Brexit, but currently there is no natural party for eurosceptic nationalists to vote when the UK is meant to be leaving the EU. If the Brexit Party can convince enough of that group to put leaving the EU before their sympathy for leaving the UK – in an election that will become a plebiscite about the EU – then it should not just win one MEP, but could just sneak a second. Some private polling I have seen suggest the SNP could lose  per cent of its vote to the Brexit Party.For the Brexit Party the Scottish political landscape may not look as fertile as it does in England and Wales – where the sense of voter outrage over May’s repeated broken promises is tangible – but it is not barren. With some careful cultivation the Brexit Party should be able to consolidate the eurosceptic support behind it and win a seat. If it can provide an appealing Scottish campaign it could go on to surprise its opponents and give Scottish eurosceptics, be they nationalists or unionists, the voicethey have deserved for the last decade.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2 won t be far behind an snp labour coalition lesley riddoch","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As the polls start pointing towards a Labour SNP coalition, indyrefwon#t be too far behind, says Lesley RiddochPredictably, Margaret Hodge’s dodgy tape recording of Jeremy Corbyn on anti-semitism ruled the roost this weekend. It dominated BBC Radio ’s World This Weekend, and the front page of the Sunday Times. Meanwhile the Observer ran with warnings that Labour faces a wipe-out unless Corbyn backs a second Brexit referendum. Jings. Anyone would think Labour was surging in the opinion polls or something – and of course, they are.It was left to Labour’s arch-critics at theto publish the awkward truth a poll of polls shows Labour would be the largest party in the event of a General Election tomorrow, whilst the Tories would lose  seats.Actually, that’s nothing new. Last week Labour’s lead was  per cent in a Harbury Strategy poll  per cent in a Kantar poll  per cent in a Survation poll,  per cent for BMG and the week before  per cent in a Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday. Indeed, there’s been a slow leftward lurch since Fiona Bruce’s infamous Question Time howler when she wellied into Diane Abbott about Labour’s parlous state in the polls. Actually, Labour were level-pegging with the Tories at the time – but who knew  Or rather, who in charge of Establishment narrative-making wanted to know In Sunday’s poll, another important result was tucked away. The SNP is predicted to pick up  seats which –accurate – would bring their tally to . Not quite the system-busting  achieved in  just after the indyref. But enough to give Jeremy Corbyn a working majority. Put another way, without the SNP, Labour could be the largest party without any clear route to government.The Lib Dem vote is also finally on the rise – the latest poll predicts they’ll add another  seats. But put together with their measly  current seats, that wouldn’t quite be enough to edge Labour over the line into power.So, is a Labour SNP coalition or supply and confidence agreement on the cards – andit is, might that allow Nicola Sturgeon to demand a Section  order from Corbyn as the price of her support  Andit does, is that a bit of an independence game-changer Yes it is.Now admittedly, a Labour SNP win is currently just conjecture. These are opinions polls – not results. The pollsters probably sampled too few Scottish voters to be accurate and several other opinion-changing electoral tests are likely before another general election – including English local elections and the probable European poll, both of which could see a sht from the main parties to Ukip or Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party. Especially since the broadcast media appeared to heave an enormous, collective sigh of relief the minute Farage appeared back on the political scene and have rushed to place him centre stage once again. It’s true too that the collapsing Conservative Party will nonetheless try to delay a general election for as long as possible. Butrecent months have proved anything, it is that no scenario can be completely ruled out on the juddering British political scene.I’ve no doubt Labour and the SNP are already talking behind the scenes – hardly surprising or very dficult these days since prominent MPs from both parties have spent weeks working together on hard Brexit-avoiding amendments. So the polls should give independence supporters cause for cheer.Theresa May’s haughty “now is still not the time” is not necessarily the last word on Scottish Independence in .Happily, the demise of Labour in Scotland and the distancing of Scottish and UK Labour since Corbyn’s election, means the UK party has very little to lose by agreeing to a process that could let Scotland go. Before the indyref, received wisdom insisted that Labour couldn’t win at Westminster without a strong contingent from north of the Border. But since Scottish Labour’s virtual annihilation in , Corbyn has realised he must largely count Scotland out. Of course, it’s true that Labour has no recent experience of power-sharingand there’s no doubt the media would portray a pact with the SNP as a colossal admission of weakness.It’s also impossible to ignore Labour’s extraordinary capacity to shoot itself in the foot. Whilst the anti-semitism story is an old one, it’s still being mishandled and is not likely to leave the front pages anytime soon. The Brexit dilemma is a real one – lack of leadership and fence-sitting have become Corbyn defaults on the biggest dilemma facing Britain. Actually, Labour’s position on that other complex national emergency – the climate emergency – is equally floppy. But in a UK first past the post election, English voters have Hobson’s Choice. Scots can vote to leave the whole sorry mess – but English voters can’t. So whatever happens at council or European level, a UK election is likely to focus minds in England on the two big parties. And despite Labour’s evident weaknesses, the prospect of a Brexiteer Tory leader and Prime Minister will make most progressive voters in England conclude that Corbyn is now the lesser of two evils. So, the prospect of a Labour SNP pact is a real one, and may further deter Nicola Sturgeon from backing any unofficial poll when she makes her long-awaited announcement on a second independence referendum on  April. Of course, that needn’t stop her launching a strategy, which could adopt citizens’ assemblies over the summer to formulate a new independence blueprint as Joanna Cherry MP has suggested. It needn’t stop the First Minister naming a preferred date for a second ballot or going through the forlorn formalities of asking Theresa May for a Section  order. But the whf of longer-term change is now in the air.The recent Leith by-election result showed the SNP and Greens picking up votes – which suggests the Euro elections will be a proxy Brexit referendum re-run with only the independence-supporting parties and the squeezed Lib Dems aligning convincingly with the popular Remain option. Obviously, nothing’s certain, but an even stronger Remain vote north of the Border will act as further evidence of material change and of the irretrievably dferent political cultures that now exist on either sidethe Border. A second independence vote may seem to have taken a back seat to Brexit. But things may be about to change.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"real living wage should be compulsory for public contracts says richard leonard","story":"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has warned#that the real living wage and trade union rights will be made compulsory obligations for any firm carrying out public sector work or hoping to win government contractsLabour wins at the next Holyrood elections.Addressing the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Mr Leonard said he wanted to lead a government that will bring about a “real sht in power” in Scotland, with greater trade union representation and labour standards for all workers. And he kick-started his party’s campaign for the  Holyrood elections by laying out his vision of a post-Brexit planned economy with government, business and trade unions working together, while also demanding the devolution of employment laws to deal with the potential economic fall-out of the UK’s departure from the EU.However his speech was criticised as both “perplexing” and “out of touch” by SNP and Tory politicians.Mr Leonard has come under sustained criticism for backing Brexit despite the majority of Scots, and Scottish Labour members, voting to remain in the European Union. His desire for a more hands-on managed economy has also come under fire as only being possible outside the EU.Yesterday he said: “We will stand on a manesto in  that makes the real living wage and labour standards, including trade union rights, not a voluntary arrangement or an optional extra in public procurement and public assistance - we will make it a compulsory requirement and an inescapable obligation.“So thatyou deploy tax avoidance and tax evasion measures like those umbrella companies so re in the construction industry then you will not win public procurement contracts and you will not receive governmental support.”He said that Brexit had shown the need for a “new framework for social dialogue in Scotland” and added that a future Scottish Labour government, would establish both “sectoral collective bargaining” and “sectoral industrial and economic planning”.“My aim as the leader is not to simply lead a better management team than the SNP. It is to lead a Scottish Labour government worthy of the name, committed to bringing about a real sht in power and wealth including an extension of industrial and economic democracy,” he said.A Scottish Labour government would also appoint a Cabinet Secretary for Labour and “protect and strengthen workers’ rights by seeking the devolution of employment law in which we will set a pre-Brexit floor to ensure that workers in Scotland are not caught up in a race to the bottom.”However, the SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: “This was a perplexing speech, in which Richard Leonard tried to pretend he’s not a Brexiteer like Nigel Farage. The fact is that he’s happy to lay waste to Scottish jobs by crashing our economy out of the EU and its single market, which is eight times the size of the UK alone. “The SNP will always welcome support for further devolution of key powers to Holyrood – but it’s hard to understand why Labour want to stop at employment law when transferring all economic levers to Scotland could truly help us to transform our economy, stop the damage of Brexit and create jobs.”And Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser MSP said: “Unfortunately none of the ideas outlined by Richard Leonard in his speech will provide the help our economy needs. It shows once again just how out of touch he and his party are when it comes to the important issues facing Scotland.”A Scottish Labour Party spokesperson denied that Mr Leonard’s economic plans were only possible outside the EU. “EU membership is not a block on making fair work compulsory in public contracts. It’s a case of political will. Labour tried to make changes to procurement law in  to extend the living wage. These proposals were blocked by SNP and Tory MSPs.”In his speech, Mr Leonard also reiterated his opposition to private finance in public services, and called for an end to PFI, PPP and NPD, adding: “The profit motive, the shareholder idend, and the ill-fitting values of capitalism should be rooted out of our public services once and for all and in that I include our railways, our buses and the Royal Mail as well.\"And in an attempt to answer his critics about the cost of his policies - including free bus travel for all - he said: “How do you think bus passenger transport services in Scotland are paid for now  Over forty per cent from public subsidy, the rest from rising passenger fares. How are our railways are paid for  Here in Scotland two thirds of rail funding comes from public spending.“And as the new Unison Jimmy Reid Foundation report just published points out - ‘approaching half of all Council Tax revenues are devoted to servicing the interest on borrowing and PFI PPP loans’. It is time that this came to an end.”Scottish Labour has previously called for the SNP to meet its  manesto pledge to scrap Council Tax and the party has suggested replacing it with a property and land tax.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may s secretive brexit approach led to blunders says report","story":"Theresa May has been accused of blundering through Brexit by creating an #unsustainable# split between government departments while her #secretive# approach to the withdrawal negotiations fuelled ision in her own Cabinet.In a highly critical report, the respected think tank the Institute for Governmentblamed Mrs May for creating a ide in responsibilities between No. and the Department for Exiting the European Union .And it said the negotiations were “bedevilled by the dficulty of getting Cabinet agreement” on the kind of relationship the UK wants with the EU.: Paris’s Notre-Dame Cathedral suffers “colossal damages” in infernoThe analysis found that politicians, particularly on the Tory backbenches, “did not trust the UK’s official negotiators” led by Olly Robbins and that “ministers, from the Prime Minister down, were unclear about instructions to officials”, which allowed critics to blame civil servants, undermining their work.The report also states that the first phase of the talks suffered due to the “inability of the politicians to make decisions and or reconcile dferent positions – resulting in undeliverable objectives” – and warns that “a similar scenario would spell disaster for phase two.”The severe criticism comes as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Mrs May could struggle to hang on to powershe cannot get her Brexit deal through Parliament before the European elections, while his former Cabinet colleague Iain Duncan Smith said Mrs May should stand down as early as next month and Chancellor Philip Hammond mocked prominent Tory Brexiteers for engaging in a “suicide pact” during previous failed bids to beat Theresa May to the Tory leadership. The turmoil in the Conservative party over Brexit is laid bare in the IfG’s Brexit report, published today. IfG programme director Jill Rutter said: “The Prime Minister moved quickly to establish the Department for Exiting the EU and the Department for International Trade within a day of taking office.“Those hasty decisions created completely foreseeable problems for the exit negotiations, compounded by the inability of the Cabinet to reach an agreed position on the key future economic relationship. Whoever is Prime Minister for the second phase of the negotiations needs to ensure that they avoid similar mistakes next time round.”The think tank recommends that, before the next stage of negotiations begin, the government should publish a mandate for an “ambitious” relationship based on a “clear view of what is negotiable” in reality. It also suggests that:l The Prime Minister should appoint a ministerial deputy to oversee the day-to-day negotiations, taking the role away from Dexeul The government should use the expertise in the Department for International Trade whose staff currently have little role in the EU negotiationsl Parliament and the devolved administrations should be engaged with early and consistentlyl The government should rethink its approach to engaging EU states following “tone deaf” interventions by ministers and the failure of the “ide and rule” tactic of trying to go over the head of the European Commission’s negotiator Michel Barnier.Tim Durrant, lead author of the IfG report, said: “It is vital that the government uses the next months to develop a better understanding of how the EU will approach the next phase. The time available for negotiations is short and the government must not waste time by failing to prepare.”The Scottish Government’s constitutional relations secretary Michael Russell said: “This merely confirms what we have consistently said – that Scotland has been ignored by the UK government throughout the Brexit process. The Prime Minister must drop her red lines, which have led to the Brexit impasse.”Meanwhile, Mr Hunt said that talks between No. and the Labour Party – aimed at finding a cross-party consensus on the way forward – were proving “more constructive” than many at Westminster had expected.“I don’t think we should rule out the possibility of getting some agreement across the House of Commons,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"this is how much the 14 top earners in scottish councils earned in 2017 18","story":"A report from the Taxpayersrsquo Alliance detailed the bumper pay deals for senior staff at local authorities with many earning far more than First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos yearly wage of £,.

How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dancing dentists scoop title","story":"A group of dancing dentists have secured a prestigious prize after their fundraising efforts raised #, for charity.Colleagues from the Bupa Dental Care Banbridge practice came together to waltz, tango, salsa and foxtrot, raising money for their long-standing charity partner, Make-A-Wish, which creates le-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses.In total, the charity event saw  couples hit the dancefloor to compete for success in front of a crowd of more than  people.

Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age.

Music and lyrics in the production are by Eurythmics legend Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, who co-wrote and produced Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, so I was looking really forward to hearing how they were going to move the story and action along.The production begins with idealistic couple Sam Wheat, played by Irish actor Niall Sheehy, and Rebekah Lowing in the role of Molly Jensen, a banker and an artist, just starting out on le after buying their first apartment together. Their lives are ripped apart after a mugging goes horribly wrong and Sam is shot dead leaving him ‘between’ here and the afterle. It is his need to protect Molly that drives him to not be welcomed by St Peter at the gates but to try find out what happened.The staging of the production is excellent, whether it’s capturing the New York skyline, taking us into the bowels of the city’s subway or to ‘psychic’ Oda Mae Brown’s palmistry studio just off the beaten track where Sam meets his ally – and a way to get answers.With such a tragic story, comic relief thankfully comes in spades with the introduction of Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae, a character brought so brilliantly to le when Whoopi Goldberg did the job onscreen. Jacqui and Niall work brilliantly together and her outlandish outfits are a sight to behold as she belts out ‘Are You a Believer’ to the sad souls coming through her door hoping for a connection to a loved one who has passed on. The use of theatrical trickery is extremely clever, especially when conveying the moment Sam is murdered and immediately becomes a ‘ghost’ or when trying to access a door or move pieces of furniture.A special mention must go to Sergio Pasquariello in his role as the couple’s shady friend Carl, who it becomes clear is in way over his head at the bank, and Jules Brown in his role as murderer Willie Lopez. Both bring menace to the stage and the message is that all is not what it seems no matter how much you think you know a person. Lovonne Zeus Richards is excellent in his role as the Subway Ghost who helps Sam realise how to use his death to his advantage in his quest for retribution.The finale is beautully staged as Sam and Molly get to – and have to – say their final goodbyes and we hear a stirring rendition from Niall Sheehy of The Righteous Brothers’ Unchained Melody – and it’s fair to say there was a bit of snuffling and snfling among the audience.Initially thought unstageable, Ghost The Musical really does work and with tickets limited throughout its week run it’s best to get them quick.Ghost The Musical runs at the Grand Opera House until Saturday April .

At the end of the current season, Sport and Leisure Swts will cease to exist and the club will change their name to Belfast Celtic. Sport and Leisure are locked in a relegation battle in the Bluefin Premier Intermediate League – the third tier of the Irish League. Relegation could see them move into the Ballymena and Provincial League, where fellow West Belfast sides St James’ Swts and Donegal Celtic currently play. However, in a surprise move, Belfast Media Group understands that the club is actively pursuing their options for next season which could see them apply for affiliation to the SSE Airtricity League . Sport and Leisure Swts are affiliated to the Irish Football Association and it was believed the new Belfast Celtic entity would simply take their place. Yet, the committee at Glen Road Heights are exploring their options with Belfast Celtic apparently free to join a dferent league.Clubs seeking to switch leagues would usually require permission from both bodies and it would be unlikely that the IFA would grant such a move. However, a club source expressed their view that the club could force a switch under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In any case, they may not need legal assistance as, strictly speaking, a new club under the name of Belfast Celtic will be formed next month when Sport and Leisure Swts ceases to exist. It is understood that the committee have already held preliminary talks with League of Ireland officials who would welcome a new member as long as the switch received the backing of the IFA. SSE Airtricity Premier Division side Derry City started off in the Irish League, winning the title in . Issues surrounding security during The Troubles forced them to play their home games in Coleraine before they dropped out of the Irish League. Following a number of years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland in . Belfast Celtic would be an interesting addition to the League of Ireland should they go down that route. Following a long and protracted saga, Sport and Leisure had their application to change their name to Belfast Celtic approved by the board of the IFA last December having consulted with the Northern Ireland Football League, the Co Antrim FA and the Belfast Celtic Society.Sport and Leisure have endured a dficult campaign have find themselves at the foot of the table with just five games remaining. They have three games in hand over second from bottom Armagh City and the sides clash at Holm Park on Saturday afternoon. Packie McAllister’s men also face two games with Portstewart in the coming weeks.Sport and Leisure’s struggles this season have been exacerbated following a host of suspensions handed out to key players in the wake of their abandoned tie with Portstewart in January. Padraig Lynch and Stephen McAlorum are among those set toto action for Saturday’s crucial trip to Armagh, but goalkeeper Michael Magill remains suspended. McAllister’s men gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation after they battled back from three goals down to claim a vital point against Dollingtown last Saturday at Glen Road Heights.An own goal from Gavin Johnston and a double from Dollingstown’s Keith Johnston seemed to gave sealed the points for the visitors and the Swts suffered a further blow when midfielder Pierce Tully was dismissed.

Our defending in the second half wasn’t good enough. We defended too deep, especially playing with the wind.“The amount of chances we had was enough to win two games. It was the same last week– we can’t concede three goals and expect to win matches.“We’ve lacked it all season. Even at - with five minutes to go, we had two great chances. We wouldn’t have taken a point and move on. At this level, we have to take those chances. I’ve said before, the commitment hasn’t been there this season, we hadn’t trained enough and we’ve been found out.“I can’t make excuses for the players anymore. “We are seven points behind with four games to go. We need to win three of them. It is up to myself to lt the team. We play Portstewart twice, Annagh is obviously a tough one and hopefully we can take it to the last game against Distillery. It is still mathematically possible, so we’ll keep fighting.

Even though the terms of the Good Friday Agreement allow me to claim Irish citizenship, EU residency seems to be a sticking point for them.”He continued: “I think it raises questions about the wider impact of Brexit on people here. I think it will close opportunities for people here who want to work abroad or for students on Erasmus.“It will be a shameother people lose out on opportunities that could benefit their education and career.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"st colms high host dutch visitors at school","story":"A delegation of Dutch educators have travelled to West Belfast to observe and learn from one of our local schools with the view of improving their own English classes. The teaching group travelled to St Colm’s in Twinbrook in the hope of gaining some insight from the school’s renowned English department.The head of the Dutch group, Lisette Bentvelzen, enthused about the opportunities and knowledge they had already gained from the trip. Talking to the Andersonstown News, she said: “We are here on a study trip to educate ourselves but we have been given the chance to come to and see how a school like this works. It has been very interesting.”“We have seen some subjects here we would love to introduce into our school. Home Economics and Photography, we don’t have. These really specialised subjects would be lovely for us to have. It was also very interesting to hear about the school, the area it’s in and the high performance they achieve.”Stressing the educational value of the trip, Ms Bentvelzen lauded the staff, students and facilities. “The children are really lovely. We’ve been in several classes but we have not been teaching, because we are from a completely dferent school.“We’ve just been observing in class, listening in, and the teacher explains to us what they#re doing. I talked to one of the students in a Home Economics class while she was cooking and she was enjoying herself and she mentioned something interesting. She told me, ‘Ive been away for a while and I’ve realised I can’t miss classes too much because you miss so much.’ It’s lovely to hear that from students.”“Being in this school is very dferent for a lot of us. We have already been to a number of other schools, we’ve got some young colleagues with us and they haven’t seen this before, so it’s an eye opener, how dferent the education system is over here.”Principal Adrian Walsh echoed these sentiments, stating that the staff and pupils were “delighted” to showcase their facilities and school ethos to their visitors.“They came to us through InterEducation, who askedwe were willing to host a party of teachers from Holland as they were trying to improve English as a foreign language in their own setting.“We felt it was a fantastic opportunity for them to come and see what we do. We have fantastic belief in our young people, we have an excellent English department and we would like to showcase St Colm’s as an outstanding school particularly in our provisions of English. “We are delighted that they#re here and they’ve had an informative, enjoyable morning. It#s been a lovely event.”On the possibility of furthering this relationship, Mr Walsh remained hopeful, telling the Andersonstown News: “Maybe there’s a partnership possibility with the school. It would be good to have contacts in another country, just so that we can share our experiences and our practices with dferent cultures and so on. “There will be plenty that we can learn from them and maybe something they can learn from us.#"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

With just a tenth of a second separating him from top spot, he carried plenty of momentum into qualying the following day with the JTR team.After dealing with a treacherous first few laps, it became clear it was the right decision and Harper took full advantage.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues.

They have bought the whole estate so that they can control everything that happens and they are anxious that nothing is ruined or destroyed.

Less than a fortnight ago, he was the proud recipient of a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Civic Award.In the run-up to Motherrsquos Day, he raised a whopping pound, for two childrenrsquos charities with his treats and tray-bakes, which were sold from an honesty box at the bottom of the driveway at his house.The money, which includes over pound which he earned from his specially created Tfany-styled, bow-wrapped Motherrsquos Day mini-hampers, will be shared between the Childrenrsquos Heart Beat Clinic and the Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos facility at Daisy Lodge in Newcastle.Mum Hazel described the Friday before Motherrsquos Day as a ldquomarathon baking day in which she and Ryan prepared shortbread caramel brownies and chocolate Rice Krispie buns and Fteens made with Turkish Delights.ldquoThey were all sold in a matter of hours, she said. ldquoWe work together because there is such a demand.ldquoAll you do is stop the car, select what you want from the honesty box which stands at the bottom of our drive and leave the appropriate money.ldquoWe have found the community here is swimming with good will and generosity.

burning in Paris, Monday, April , . Massive plumes of yellow brown smoke is filling the air above Notre Dame Cathedral and ash is falling on tourists and others around the island that marks the center of Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron postponed a televised speech to the nation because of the stunning blaze and was going to the cathedral himself.He tweeted: “Our Lady of Paris in flames. Emotion of a whole nation. Thought for all Catholics and for all French. Like all our countrymen, I’m sad tonight to see this part of us burn.”Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “Have just come away from the bank of the Seine after the spire fell as I can’t bear to watch any more. Fearful for anyone close to the flames, and aghast that centuries of history  beauty could disappear into smoke so fast.”Ashley Huntington, , an American university student studying in Paris, said: “Our class ran what was supposed to be  minutes walking but we probably got here in  running.“You could just get close and see the smoke. The smoke is everywhere in the sky. It seems like more pieces of the scaffolding are currently falling.”She added: “It just looks like it’s out of control. I’ve never seen a fire in real le but the flames keep getting bigger and bigger. I don’t think it’s getting better at all.Handout photo taken with permission from the twitter feed of @slopezserra of smoke pouring from Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which is on fire.

the uplting connection people feel with cathedrals and churches the world over.“But no matter the destruction, the spirit of what it means to be a cathedral can and does survive such catastrophes.“In England, the spire at Lincoln collapsed in the s, St Paul’s was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and Coventry was destroyed by bombs.“All have been rebuilt, sometimes taking on new forms, to stand as reminders of eternity and resurrection which are the foundation of the Christian faith.”try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinOrange Order confirms July

As part of our strategy to address this, we make smart investments in information communications and outreach.”When asked again how much it had spent on marketing and whether money which the regulator had approved for staff salaries was being used to fund the publicity, the company said that it would “won’t be making any further comment”.When asked how much SONI had spent on marketing, the Utility Regulator said that it had not approved “a specic spend for ‘promotional activity’”.The regulator said that “it is not unreasonable to assume that there should be less need for signicant promotional activities in circumstances where a company is a monopoly service provider like SONI”.However, it said that regulated utilities “may, on occasion, need to undertake consumer engagement and public affairs related work to successfully deliver signicant utility projects”.Last week the News Letter revealed that after the takeover of SONI by Eirgrid, the Northern Ireland electricity grid was altered so that it can be operated from the Dublin control room of the Irish government-owned company.One industry source said that the move made practical sense and was an outworking of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland.But the history of electricity in Northern Ireland – where electricity was in  used as a weapon by loyalists to bring down power-sharing – makes the development politically sensitive.try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinOrange Order confirms July  venues for Stricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant

It is the most beautul cathedral I have ever seen.”The president of France Emmanuel Macron tonight spoke of the “emotion of a whole nation”, and said the world was witnessing nothing less than “part of us burn”.Echoing such language, Mrs de Saint Hilaire said “I am there” as she watched live TV from her apartment in Paris’s th arrondissement.She first set foot in Notre Dame on a visit to Paris for her th birthday, and visited it regularly after moving to the city decades ago. Audibly distressed, she said: “I don’t believe it is happening. I just hope it is an accident. If it is anything , it is not possible.”Mrs de Saint Hilaire last set foot in Notre Dame a year or so ago, but did not go inside much in recent years because of the queues of tourists.But she loved to sit in the Shakespeare and Co cafe on the left bank of the River Seine and look across to the cathedral’s twin spires. “I am an architecture fan. It takes your breath away, it still does.”Reflecting a sense of trauma felt across France, she said: “I am terrible.”Officials said the fire may be linked to renovation work French media reported.The Catholic archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin wrote this message online tonight: “Heartbreaking to see the sacred and historic Notre Dame cathedral engulfed with flame. Sending prayers from Ireland to Archbishop Michel Aupetit at the Diocese of Paris and the people of Paris.”The Facebook page for Monkstown Parish Church, a large imposing th century Anglican church in Dublin, said tonight: “Any of us who have the stewardship of historic and iconic buildings live in dread of such events.Former soldier faces murder charge over death of NI teenager in \"  \"  Message of Christian solidarity as Notre Dame blaze halted Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Our prayers this evening for the whole cathedral community and for those who love this building dearly.”One of the city’s oldest and most recognisable buildings, work began on Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral in .

This will be Travelodgersquos first hotel in Penarth.Opening a Travelodge hotel in the town would represent an investment of around poundm for third party investors and create  new jobs.Travelodges own studies indicate customers spend double their room rate with local businesses during their stay, which would equate to a multimillion spend annually.This expansion programme was announced today at the official opening of Rhyl Seafront Travelodge, the hotel companyrsquos th hotel and its th in Wales.Tony OrsquoBrien, Travelodge Development Director said: ldquoAs Walesrsquo first branded budget hotel chain we are delighted to celebrate  years of trading in Wales by opening our first hotel in Rhyl and announcing plans to open a further seven hotels including a second hotel in Wrexham.\"During the last three decades we have become symbolic in Wales for offering great value. However, with locations such as Penarth growing from strength to strength there is a shortage of good quality and low cost accommodation to fulfil demand. Therefore we are looking to expand our portfolio in Wales with a further seven hotels, this will boost our presence to .Cllr Jonathan Bird, Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Planning, said: \"This is very exciting news for Penarth. The council does a huge amount of work to promote the Vale as both a destination for visitors and a place for companies to do business.\"To be at the top of the list for a major operator that is looking to expand represents a vote of confidence from the sector for the Vale of Glamorgan and a vindication of this hard work.\"We look forward to discussing potential locations with Travelodge and hopefully announcing further developments in the near future.The other six locations to make the Travelodge Wales expansion programme are Aberystwyth, Pwllheli, Swansea, Tenby, Torfaen Blaenau and Wrexham.Collectively this expansion programme represents an investment of poundm for third party investors and will create  new jobs across Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/next2.jpg","title":"next  ni smes sees  sales surge","story":"Posted on Tuesday April  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s leading small and medium-sized businesses have seen a .% surge in sales in the last year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Next  is Ulster Business’s showcase of SMEs based across Northern Ireland, and follows directly on from the Top  Northern Ireland Companies list, ranking firms based on turnover from the latest filed accounts to Companies House.Turnover growth has surged among the businesses this year, adding up to £.bn across the , with this list of companies increasing turnover by .%, year-on-year.John Lavery of Grant Thornton, who helped analyse and compile the list, said: “The Next  is a fascinating insight into Northern Ireland business. “The list is a broad mix of household names and less well-known companies that are delivering over £bn in turnover and employment for more than , people.“These firms are the le blood of the NI economy, operating across the whole of NI and across a broad range of sectors. “The combined turnover of this group of firms is .% higher than a year previous.“This performance is all the more impressive when we think of the Northern Ireland economy as a whole, where aggregate turnover across all companies declined.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
