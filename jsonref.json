Theresa May (pictured outside No10 tonight turning the Christmas tree lights on) is scrambling to try to get her Brexit deal through the Commons in the face of overwhelming oppositionSir Graham Brady, chair of the powerful Tory backbench 1922 committee, also waded into the row this evening by saying he would \u0027welcome\u0027 a delay to the vote. Mrs May gathered her senior Cabinet minsters for emergency talks at Number Ten tonight as she scrambles to try to reverse her fortunes and avoid defeat.But the PM has vowed to press ahead with the Brexit showdown despite staring down the barrel of catastrophic defeat.  Mrs May struck a defiant tone on BBC Radio 4 this morning as she warned there is no other deal on the table.And she said that killing her proposal off would either end up with the UK crashing out of the EU - or Brexit not happening at all. The premier also confirmed that she is looking at ways to sweeten her blueprint for mutinous MPs - suggesting there could be a parliamentary \u0027lock\u0027 on the Irish border backstop arrangements coming into force. Asked repeatedly about calls from senior ministers to put off the Commons showdown on Tuesday, Mrs May said: \u0027We are in the middle of five days of debate in Parliament which will lead up to a vote on this issue.\u0027      "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye Wests stepfather reveals rapper confident prodigy genius child","story":"    Kanye West\u0027s \u0027stepfather\u0027 has told DailyMailTV that the outspoken rapper has always had an ego as he reveals that the \u0027prodigy genius child\u0027 had a slight speech impediment and had dreams of becoming a baseball player          Speaking to DailyMailTV, Blakeley says that from a young age Kanye\u0027s talent was \u0027off the scale\u0027, saying he was \u0027a prodigy genius child from when I first set eyes on him\u0027          Ulysses Blakeley lived with West and his mother Donda throughout the musician\u0027s childhood.   The 67-year-old watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago    Ulysses Blakeley  was one of Donda\u0027s last true loves before she died after a botched cosmetic surgery operation in November 2007Blakeley said Kanye would rap in poems all the time instead of speaking normally, even for the most mundane things, like passing the salt at the dinner table. \u0027We installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does artistically or poetically. So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/15/16/03B6E933000003E8-0-image-m-8_1542300429456.jpg","title":"How Yoko Ono relentlessly pursued John Lennon","story":"John Lennon became mesmerized by Yoko Ono (pictured in 1968) after she relentlessly pursued him everywhere he went – in person and with letters, a new book claims           The superstar\u0027s aunt Mimi called Yoko a poisoned dwarf and John\u0027s band mates Paul, Ringo and George did not want her sitting in on album recording sessions or label meetings. Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027. Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author. Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.          Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John (pictured in 1969), getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was. She even showed up at a meeting that Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian HimalayasYoko wrote John multiple times a week while he was in India. He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital. She got pregnant, quickly orced Toshi and married Cox.Cox delivered the baby at home and continued to do most of the childcare for their daughter. When fame eluded Yoko in Japan, she returned to New York.          Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist.

There were no reviews.Invited to appear at a symposium in London, she reconnected with John who \u0027finally found someone who was balmy as I am\u0027, John told his friend Pete Shotton.Yoko and John became a couple and a brand -- JohnandYoko -- and the \u0027poisoned dwarf\u0027 finally got her wish. \u0027She was becoming famous\u0027.They were never apart for the next three years before moving to Manhattan in 1971.With Yoko, he was no longer the front man as he was with the Beatles and never away from her side.Ronnie Spector, 75, reveals the moment her \u0027abusive\u0027...Tantalising secrets of The Beatles buried in the White...John Lennon\u0027s killer reveals he purposely used hollow...Share this articleThey dressed in matching white suits and both parted their long hair down the middle. John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band.Yoko had already expressed she didn\u0027t like rock and roll music and viewed it as culturally crude. She made suggestions in a field she knew nothing about.She was staging her own \u0027events\u0027 that critics viewed as \u0027Yoko\u0027s vanity projects that John was funding. Interest in them was low to non-existent,\u0027 writes the author.John sued Cynthia for orce citing adultery, a charge later withdrawn and reversed to John\u0027s uncontested adultery.Now he could marry Yoko but she was still married to Cox who had originally encouraged Yoko to pursue John as an art patron and she owed him a lot of money.          Inseparable, John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band. Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.          While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music. Neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four          After Yoko gave her blessing to May and John (pictured together in 1974), the pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months. Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller.

She said she passed out and the next morning thought she\u0027d had a stroke          The shocking footage shows her appear to lose consciousness then collapse on the floor behind the bar           She appears to be out cold on the ground as fellow party-goers gather around to see if she is ok. Afterwards Miss Phillips said she felt forced to quit the pub where Mr Webb still works   The alleged incident took place at the Cameo Club in Roath, Cardiff (pictured) where Miss Phillips and Mr Webb both worked at the timeBar manager, 24, who thought she had suffered a stroke...Flybe pilot who was fired after developing a fear of flying...Share this articleAnd today the footage was played at an employment tribunal, which ruled in Miss Phillips\u0027 favour that she was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party.She told the court she suffered such serious facial paralysis that she may never be able to smile properly again.The Cameo Club had its last Christmas party on New Years Day but the morning after the bash, she woke up and noticed she had slight facial palsy but was baffled as to why.Fearing she was having a stroke, she went to the doctors but was told her injuries were \u0027either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage\u0027.Returning to work, she viewed the CCTV to find out what had gone on and saw Webb appear to choke her.The tribunal heard that burly Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.He is still employed by the bar.           Ms Phillips, who had no recollection of what happened, went to hospital the following day fearing she had had a stroke after after sending her mum a photo of her sloping mouth           Mr Webb can be seen on the CCTV leaning over after he appears to throttle the bar manager at the staff Christmas party in CardiffMs Phillips initially returned to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action.But as time went, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of WebbAt the same time, medics were telling her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought.Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameo\u0027s directors for failing to take her concerns seriously.She said: \u0027The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor.\u0027It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation.\u0027I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant\u0027s feelings about the incident. He told her to \u0027get over it\u0027 when referring to the Christmas party incident.\u0027          Ms Phillips (pictured) told how she passed out after chef Mr Webb gripped her neck at a Christmas party  Miss Phillips said she told firm bosses Huw Davies (pictured left at Cardiff magistrates courthouse) and Jason Pearce (right) of the attack, but her complaints were not taken seriouslySince the incident, Ms Phillips says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression.She added: \u0027I can\u0027t smile in photographs.\u0027People don\u0027t notice it, but I notice it more than anything.\u0027If it\u0027s still like that when I get married, I won\u0027t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It\u0027s not nice.\u0027But she said the worst bit was the fact her bosses didn\u0027t do anything.She continued: \u0027I\u0027d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable.\u0027In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardiff Magistrates Court in November, she claimed the club\u0027s company director, Jason Pearce, was heard joking about the incident with Mr Webb.She also told the hearing that after other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb including putting chilli in a staff member\u0027s soup and threatening someone on a night out, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability \u0027to keep her safe in her workplace\u0027.She claimed she was told in one meeting on April 4 by another director Huw Davies to just \u0027get over it\u0027, and was told the same comment again on April 18.In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.She wrote: \u0027She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March.\u0027In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a different way.\u0027Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb.\u0027Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace.            Miss Phillips has won her case against the company for unfair dismissal at the employment tribunal and has submitted a personal injury claim. She told the hearing that she felt that she was forced to quit \u0027In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site.\u0027She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.She said: \u0027Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled.\u0027Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once.\u0027The judge concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Ms Phillips raised - she was justified in resigning and was \u0027constructively unfairly dismissed.\u0027Afterwards Ms Phillips said she had a \u0027sense of relief\u0027 adding: \u0027It just feels like a weight lifted,\u0027 she added. \u0027I don\u0027t want to think about it anymore.\u0027Cameo Club declined to comment while South Wales Police said: \u0027A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"So Brexit Plan Bs work","story":"The looming wrangling over Brexit be fierce, with little sign of a big majority in Parliament for any of the proposed solutions\u0027Oh come all ye faithful!\u0027 Theresa May sings a carol on the...London stock market plunges to a two-year low amid fears of...Share this articleParliament takes control and forces Norway-plusIn the wake of a defeat on her deal, Mrs May would have 21 days to bring a new plan to the House of Commons. But an amendment tabled by Tory Remainer rebel Dominic Greive and passed this week has given parliament a platform to start dictating the terms.MPs will be able to spell out potential plans and vote on them - giving a strong indication of where opinion lies.  Support is likely to gather around a \u0027Norway-plus\u0027 plan that has long been pushed by Tory backbencher Nick Boles. Former Cabinet ministers Oliver Letwin said this week that he believes there is a majority for that style of relationship, other senior figures such as Nicky Morgan have endorsed it, along with substantial numbers of Labour MPs. A group of Cabinet ministers have been mulling it over as a fallback plan. It would effectively keep the UK in the single market, with a customs bolt-on to avoid a hard Irish border, and backers say it would keep Britain close to the EU while cutting contributions to Brussels.However, critics say it has the drawbacks of keeping free movement, - and tightly limiting the possibilities for doing trade deals elsewhere.The EU is also thought to have concerns about a country the UK\u0027s size joining the EEA, while other states in the group might be resistant.  If the Norway model was endorsed by the Commons, it would not be binding on the government.But it would have huge political force, and it might be very difficult for ministers to face down the calls.Mrs May is unlikely to be able to put the policy in place as it break her often-stated red lines.In the end, it might need a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a respected cross-party figure, to put the UK on course for Norway-plus - with the prospect of a general election soon afterwards.   \u0027Press are under attack\u0027: Amal Clooney speaking at UN awardsVideo shows 153 alleged young rioters arrested at French high schoolAmal Clooney says Donald Trump has given regimes the \u0027green light\u0027Sir Graham Brady supports deferring of Brexit vote if necessaryMan stabs his victim in the neck for \u0027taking too long\u0027 in a queueGeorge H.W.

The EU has also insisted it will not unpick the orce package thrashed out in painstaking negotiations. Mrs May has also pointed out that the Canada model would not solve the Irish border issue, as there would need to be checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Eurosceptics dismiss this problem as confected, saying technology and trusted trade schemes can ensure there is no hard border.They also say that the EU would be more willing to compromise if it really believes that the UK would go through with a no-deal exit.  \u0027Press are under attack\u0027: Amal Clooney speaking at UN awardsVideo shows 153 alleged young rioters arrested at French high schoolAmal Clooney says Donald Trump has given regimes the \u0027green light\u0027Sir Graham Brady supports deferring of Brexit vote if necessaryMan stabs his victim in the neck for \u0027taking too long\u0027 in a queueGeorge H.W.

I\u0027m looking at the role of Parliament in that choice,\u0027 Mrs May said.  The alternative would be to extend the transition period beyond December 2020 - but the Withdrawal Agreement states that can only last until 2022. After that point the backstop would come into force under the orce terms. Parliament will get to vote on whether to extend transition in June 2020 or to enter the backstop - subject to a final agreement with the EU - if trade talks are unfinished.After the extended transition ends, the backstop will kick in if there is still no final trade deal. Despite admitting the orce deal cannot be changed, Mrs May\u0027s spokeswoman said: \u0027She\u0027s aware of the strength of feeling and listening to colleagues about how parliament could have a wider say.\u0027     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/06/14/490B1DBB00000578-6467335-One_voter_said_the_best_thing_about_fifth_place_Blackpool_is_the-a-8_1544106581487.jpg","title":"Has town just named one Britains worst","story":"    Huddersfield (above) topped the list.

Samantha is pictured right with Meghan years ago          Dooley also revealed he remains extremely close to his grandfather Thomas Markle (pictured in June), who he described as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the hardest part, the fact that there is no privacy. It is hard to deal with.\u0027 Dooley revealed he is currently estranged from his father, who earlier this year released a public letter begging Prince Harry not to marry Meghan. \u0027The only family I have left now are my mom, brother, and grandfather,\u0027 Dooley said. \u0027We are still close and fine but for the rest of my family, their lives are lived out in the tabloids and that is the hardest thing.\u0027 \u0027I have to read what\u0027s going on in my family in the news because I don\u0027t even speak to them.\u0027 While Dooley hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan in three years, he defended his aunt and said she doesn\u0027t deserve the way Samantha and his father have spoken about her. \u0027Meghan has always been a hard worker,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know she focused on her passion and trying to make a name for herself.\u0027           Meghan (pictured age 11) is seen next to Dooley, her father Thomas Markle Sr, Dooley\u0027s brother Thomas, and Samantha Markle \u0027She was a young girl with big ambitions. She wanted to make history. It was like me when I went to college. It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t want to talk to my family. I just didn\u0027t want to be distracted.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know exactly what has gone on but there\u0027s no justifications for Samantha\u0027s actions. You can\u0027t justify what any of them have done.\u0027    Dooley also revealed he remains extremely close to his grandfather Thomas Markle.           Samantha is currently writing a tell-all book about Meghan she plans to release during the birth of the Duchess\u0027 first child \u0027I speak to my grandfather nearly every day,\u0027 he said. \u0027I would love to speak about what he is really like as a person.\u0027 \u0027He always made every holiday special. He always went above and beyond and brought the joy and birthdays and Christmas.\u0027 \u0027He is a very kind man and showed us all a lot of love. Even more for Meghan. He bent over backwards for her.\u0027 Dooley described Thomas Markle as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 who was a \u0027very good parent\u0027 to the future Duchess of Sussex. \u0027Whether that contradicts reports that are out, I don\u0027t care,\u0027 he said. \u0027Because I can tell you on record he is a very kind, caring, loving person who adores Meghan. \u0027I would stand by that every day of the week.\u0027 Dooley hasn\u0027t met his aunt\u0027s husband, but only has nice things to say about Prince Harry and hopes he might one day meet his future cousins. \u0027I am a fan of Prince Harry. I see a lot of similarities between me and Prince Harry,\u0027 said Dooley, who runs a cannabis farm in Oregon that sells a special strain called \u0027Markle Sparkle\u0027. \u0027He is a normal down-to-earth guy and I love that about him.\u0027 Dooley said \u0027time will tell\u0027 if he will get to meet Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s child, which is due next spring - the same time Samantha Markle plans to release a tell-all book called In The Shadows Of The Duchess.           Dooley (pictured with his mother Tracey Dooley) is a cannabis farmer in Oregon and has developed a special strain called Markle Sparkle\u0027I have no expectations to be honest,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m just going to let things work out as they should and have faith it will all be okay.\u0027 Dooley said he decided to star in MTV UK\u0027s The Royal World - which also features UK Baroness Jessica Heyde, and \u0027Counts\u0027 Dimitri and Michael Campbell - because he wanted to \u0027set the record straight\u0027 about his family.  Archie Manners, the show\u0027s host, said Dooley talks about his aunt a lot on the show and offers a \u0027different set of facts\u0027. \u0027He gets an opportunity to give the other side of the story, and it\u0027s a story that I think needs telling,\u0027 Manners told The Sun. \u0027It\u0027s a story I think we should know because we\u0027ve heard one side of it.

Solar panels are seen above on homes in Scripps Ranch, San DiegoUpholding a May 9 vote by the California Energy Commission, the Building Standards Commission\u0027s seal of approval made the motion official on December 5.However, despite the rapturous applause the bill\u0027s passing was met with, there are some opposed to the new provisions because of the additional costs homeowners will now incur.  The solar furnishings add an estimated $10,000 to the cost of building a single-family home – including more than $8,400 for installing panels and roughly $1,500 for energy efficiency. The added expenses come at a time when affordable housing in California is already scarce - the state\u0027s house prices are already double the national average.            The provisions could cost homeowners an additional $10,000, at a time when the state is already facing an affordable housing crisis. Pictured above, employees carry solar panels onto the roof of a home in Lafayette, California, U.S., on Tuesday, May 15Additional worries were also raised on behalf of the victims of last month\u0027s devastating California wildfires, which destroyed more than 10,000 structures and left thousands of families homeless. The concern was that those seeking to rebuild in the wake of the disaster may not be able to afford the additional up-front charges. The committee however stated this wouldn\u0027t be an issue.             California was decimated by the most deadly wildfires in its history last month, with thousands of homes destroyed and 88 dead (Pictured: firefighters attempt to extinguish a blazing home in Malibu, California on November 9)California homeowners will have the option to either pay the costs up front or sign a \u0027power purchase agreement,\u0027 which pays for the electricity without buying the panels, according to an official with the California Energy Commission. \u0027The homeowners will be able to save money from the day they walk in the door,\u0027 said Kelly Knutsen, technology advancement director for the California Solar \u0026amp Storage Association, to The Orange County Register.  Knutsen added: \u0027This is a historical policy. California is leading the country in clean energy, clean air and fighting climate change, all while saving consumers money.\u0027Officials also say the 30-year life of the solar panels will offset the utility bills, helping families save up to $500 a year. Kent Sasaki, a structural engineer and one of six commissioners voting for the new energy code, added: \u0027These provisions really are historic and will be a beacon of light for the rest of the country.\u0027(It\u0027s) the beginning of substantial improvement in how we produce energy and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.\u0027           The commission hope other states in the US will use their plan as a blueprint to adopt similar measures"},{"url":null,"title":"Tensions mount ministers Speaker John Bercow","story":"There are grumblings that the Speaker (pictured) appears determined to make it as difficult as possible for the government In October, Mr Bercow faced criticism over a report that found bullying and sexual harassment at Parliament was \u0027tolerated\u0027 by the House authorities.

There he is with his second wife Julie, living the dream, walking hand in hand in swimsuits along a flawless, empty tropical beach, white sand cushioning their bare feet.A gilded couple silhouetted against a golden setting sun – an image that was flaunted on Facebook.It may have been the Caribbean – a faviourite destination for Mr and Mrs Betts. His annual remuneration of £1.7million can buy a lot of holidays there.The chief executive of publicly-funded Motability Operations, which supplies vehicles to the disabled, enjoys other trappings, too – all the fripperies of the modern boss, such as gold-plated medical insurance, entertainment expenses and away-days in posh hotels to discuss \u0027strategy\u0027. And, of course, nice cars.\u0027It goes without saying that he loves his cars, and he never drives anything more than six months old,\u0027 says one who has worked for Betts. His car changes all the time. He\u0027s into his Mercs and likes Range Rovers, too. Some of the other directors go for Porsche 911s.\u0027Motability\u0027s London office is on the south bank of the Thames in Southwark. The directors all have offices on the top floor, which had an expensive refit a few years ago. \u0027They didn\u0027t scrimp on anything,\u0027 adds the former employee. \u0027It was stupid money, spent on high-quality artworks, beautiful wooden furniture and top-end fixtures and fittings.\u0027Then there is the penthouse flat. Mr Betts, 56 – a father of two grown-up children – is lucky enough to live just around the corner from his office in a £5million suite in a super-trendy warehouse conversion within a popping champagne cork\u0027s distance of Tower Bridge.From his balcony overlooking the river, Mr Betts, a Buckinghamshire boy made good and then some, can survey the London skyline, bubbly in hand, and celebrate his good fortune.He\u0027s a generous boss, too, according to that former employee. \u0027He will often hand his credit card to another director to buy drinks at the bar.\u0027But then he can afford to be generous, given his level of income. It does, however, prompt the question: What is his extraordinary pay package for, exactly?          Mr Betts, 56 – a father of two grown-up children – is lucky enough to live just around the corner from his office in a £5million suite in a super-trendy warehouse conversion within a popping champagne cork\u0027s distance of Tower BridgeNot least because Mr Betts will be walking into the corporate sunset in the not-too-distant future, quitting by May 2020 following 16 years in the job and after coming under fire from the media and politicians on all sides in the past year.But not before he has filled his boots with yet more money – a hitherto secret £2million bonus exposed by the Mail this week – also from the taxpayer.Motability Operations (MO) is a public limited company, but that designation is somewhat misleading. It is not a corporation in the genuine FTSE100 sense, but the delivery arm of a charitable enterprise called Motability, established in 1977 to help disabled people acquire reasonably priced and reliable cars, scooters and powered chairs. The scheme is very popular, with 614,000 customers as of September last year.Its \u0027Plc\u0027 tag suggests a major company subject to market turbulence and risk, constantly fighting competitors, red in tooth and claw. After all, vehicle leasing is a crowded, ever-evolving market. The challenges of free competition are routinely trotted out to justify stratospheric boardroom rewards, but MO is a stranger to this commercial jungle. It grazes in much safer territory.It is a monopoly, the sole recipient of mobility benefit paid by the Department of Work and Pensions to disabled claimants who want to use the scheme – a single, ultra-reliable source of funding.What\u0027s more, MO benefits from generous tax breaks of £890million. Due to this huge built-in advantage, and because of its vast purchasing power in the new car market, MO can drive down the price of the vehicles it buys.Married substitute teacher, 27, who preyed on 15-year-old...Share this articleEffectively, this is a licence to print money – shown by MO\u0027s accumulation of a vast £2.62billion reserve, mostly in vehicles, which are sold into the second-hand market after three years.The shareholders – four high street banks – are not allowed idends, so this pile of taxpayers\u0027 money sits there, growing larger. In its damning report, released today, the official spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, repeatedly points to these implicit advantages, criticising MO for setting executive performance targets that are almost impossible to miss, given its unique circumstances. This resulted in five executive directors of the company receiving bonuses of £15.3million between 2008 and 2015.Indeed, it would take a pretty dumb bunch of executives to mess up such a \u0027business\u0027. But this has not stopped the top people at MO patting themselves on the back and awarding each other lavish, fat-cat payouts on a regular basis.As for finding out Mr Betts\u0027 total annual remuneration package (revealed by this paper in February) – which includes performance and loyalty bonuses paid for reaching targets that are easy to maintain and loyalty that should be a given in his position – it wasn\u0027t easy because a big chunk of it was squirrelled away in the firm\u0027s annual accounts under an entry that did not bear Mr Betts\u0027 name.Yet, Motability is a far from perfect scheme. Only a third of the 1.72million mobility benefit claimants eligible to join it actually do, and they found themselves being overcharged to the tune of £390million for their lease agreements when MO over-estimated the rate of depreciation on vehicles.The Motability scheme itself has previously been criticised for its failure to police itself. Disabled applicants can nominate able-bodied relatives and friends to drive their vehicles if they can\u0027t manage it, leading to claims that able-bodied people are using cars bought mainly for their own use.Surely the most bloated feline on the block is Michael Keith Betts. MO assures the world that his pay and privileges are decided independently by the remuneration committee – of which he is a member. Conflict of interest is avoided, says MO, by Mr Betts leaving the room while his stonking pay packet is discussed.          It may be that Mike Betts harbours an appetite for yet more years behind a sprawling desk. But, if not, he will be able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, enjoying those flawless stretches of sand in the West Indies. And he has you, the humble British taxpayer, to thank for it\u0027Betts comes over as a nice guy – he is on first-name terms with everyone and he will talk to anyone on any level – but it\u0027s not always a fun conversation,\u0027 adds the source. \u0027He has an unnerving habit of suddenly checking if you know the exact price of a particular car to keep you on your toes.\u0027He is very much the boss and is basically surrounded by yes-men. He always knows exactly what he wants and pushes people hard to get it. He can be quite ruthless.\u0027The National Audit Office points out that MO insists on comparing itself to real private businesses rather than the \u0027public-sector entities\u0027 and \u0027charitable trusts\u0027 that it more closely resembles.Acidly, the report\u0027s authors point out that even BBC executives inhabit a more competitive environment than MO bosses and take home far less moneyThe Motability charity\u0027s governors have been aware of this inconsistency for years – as correspondence contained in the NAO report shows – but have done precious little to rein in such greed.The NAO reveals that governors of the Motability charity often spend far longer in post than the recommended nine years – sometimes twice as long – and it suggests refreshing the ranks of those whose job it is to monitor how MO bosses spend public money.There is perhaps 18 months before Mr Betts bids farewell to the corporate trough, effectively forced out by howls of criticism from Parliament and diligent reporting by this newspaper.MO puts a gloss on events, issuing this statement: \u0027After 16 years in the business, Motability Operations chief executive Mike Betts and the board of Motability Operations Group plc have agreed that, following the implementation of actions agreed as an outcome of the NAO review, and working to help the new chairman settle in, a suitable successor will be found, and Mike will step down from the board, no later than May 2020.\u0027The board is clear that recommendations made by the NAO will benefit from Mr Betts\u0027s experience and skills to see them through.\u0027It may be that Mike Betts harbours an appetite for yet more years behind a sprawling desk. But, if not, he will be able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, enjoying those flawless stretches of sand in the West Indies. And he has you, the humble British taxpayer, to thank for it."},{"url":null,"title":"Eight Britains elite schools sent pupils Oxbridge 75 cent country","story":"    Eton College in Berkshire lists David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg among its alumni and charges pupils £40,000 in fees          St Paul\u0027s for Boys also ranked in the top eight, sending 53 to Oxbridge last year they charge fees of £37,000\u0027I didn\u0027t know if my diabetic daughter was in a coma\u0027: O2\u0027s...How Luxembourg\u0027s Prince Louis enjoys six holidays a year and...Share this articleAlso included was £39,000-a-year Westminster, which sends 70 to 80 to Oxbridge, and £37,000-a-year St Paul\u0027s for Boys in London, which last year sent 53.The Sutton Trust said it could not disclose the other five schools due to data permission issues.The Trust\u0027s Access to Advantage report analysed UCAS data for university acceptance rates by school type.It found that the eight schools and colleges with the highest number of Oxbridge acceptances had 1,310 between them over a three-year period.In contrast, 2,894 schools across the country with two or fewer acceptances sent just 1,220 pupils to Oxford or Cambridge in the same time period.

Don’t panic – our guide will help you get organised, giving you more time to relax and enjoy the festive season. Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aea2d1c42130903b3b47ef6c104657db4e78972/263_0_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b16e6edcefcd9abe44894faa7da92ef","title":"christmas unwrapped how do you open your presents","story":"From cryptic clues to silly stocking fillers, family rituals around present-giving can make for a more memorable festive experienceWhen it comes to opening Christmas presents, many families have their own time-honoured rituals. Maybe you just can’t wait until the 25th and always unwrap a present each on Christmas Eve before heading to mass? Or perhaps you all have to wait until your (usually late) uncle arrives at nana’s before the paper ripping can begin? Maybe you take your time over it and have a methodical approach, spreading out the present-opening over the course of the day.For many people, these traditions, re-enacted year after year with a comforting familiarity, are partly what makes Christmas special to them.Rachael Gibson, who runs The Hair Historian Instagram account, says her family has developed a rather unusual tradition when it comes to opening presents. At the family home in Sheffield, every family member has to present their gift with a cryptic clue tagged to it – and the recipient is forbidden from opening it until they’ve solved the conundrum. “The clue is usually to do with the present, and the format of the clues is pretty open, but they’re always cryptic-crossword-level complex – anagrams, or references to some historical figure or event,” she says.According to Gibson, her mother started adding cryptic clues to presents when she was a teenager. “My mum has always been a crossword fanatic, and she favours the extremely complicated cryptic ones,” she says. “She also loves quizzes and any kind of wordplay, so that has always been a big part of family life. At some point when we were teenagers, my mum decided to introduce a tradition that we had to write cryptic-crossword-style clues on our Christmas presents for one another. Setting clues is a challenge in itself, and I always have it in mind when I’m buying gifts.”The yearly ritual is so ingrained in the household that Gibson, who lives in London, says it wouldn’t feel like Christmas without it. “We’re a small family, with just the four of us, so I like that it marks out our gifts and makes them more special than anything else under the tree,” she says.The Agarwals, like many families, open one present each on Christmas Eve and then leave stockings at the end of their beds. “This has been the same for the past eight years or so,” says Pragya Agarwal, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, with her husband and three daughters – Prishita, 21, and twins April and India, both two. Christmas morning always begins with a hearty breakfast of pancakes and smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. Then the family sits next to the Christmas tree as her husband hands out one present at a time to each person, and they open them at the same time.“We all have our own inidual stockings that we use every year,” says Agarwal, the owner of gift businesses The Art Tiffin and Hedge and Hog Prints. “I bought the stockings in India, and they are beautifully handcrafted in traditional Indian designs. It makes me feel close to my parents who still live in India, and I feel that it fosters the same pride and closeness to their heritage in my children in some way.”Although the stocking fillers can vary from bath bombs to stationery, there are always the same three things sitting at the bottom: gold chocolate coins, a satsuma and a walnut. “Our eldest has grown up with these rituals and they are important to her,” says Agarwal.Creating traditions can define Christmas for families. “I feel that having continuity and these silly and very personal rituals make us feel closer as a family,” says Agarwal. “My twins are just two, so this would really be the first time that they’ll be able to understand Christmas, but I can’t wait to introduce these things to them too.”For great gift ideas and stocking fillers, check out AO’s Christmas range"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd7c1ec0e7dd10eada046f5e340928c26ddfa96/0_0_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5cc37abf797038b5aa571db9b03d29e","title":"top toys for 2018 and the 500 extra youll spend five facts about christmas shopping","story":"Expect to see slime and the Boxer robot topping children’s gift lists, plenty of online shopping, and more socks under the treeWe spend the equivalent of two working weeks preparing for ChristmasChristmas is time-consuming. A 2016 survey by the Post Office gift card One4All found that the average Briton spends 66 hours and 44 minutes preparing for Christmas – that’s the equivalent of almost two working weeks in a full-time job. No wonder we’re ready to put our feet up on Christmas Day! Shopping for gifts was the activity that sucked up the most time, according to the survey, followed by shopping for food and decorations. And, interestingly, men spent 53 minutes more than women prepping for the 25th.Top toys for 2018 – the Boxer robot and Lego Harry PotterEvery year brings a new batch of bestsellers, and retailers expect the bestselling toys this season to include Lego’s Harry Potter Hogwarts Express, a plush toy of children’s TV favourite Peppa Pig dressed as a royal guard, and the Boxer robot – a mini robot that reacts to people and plays games. Also high on the list is a Nerf gun that fires lasers instead of the usual foam arrows.One popular 2017 gift that isn’t going anywhere this year is slime. After first being launched in the 1970s, and sold in eye-catching trash cans, the putty gained a new generation of followers last year on Instagram with a fresh, aesthetically pleasing approach: it’s all about pastel colours and glitter.The most popular gift is clothingThe category with the highest spend over Christmas tends to be clothing – those socks, pyjamas and scarves are perennial Christmas favourites.However, research from PriceWaterhouseCoopers suggests a significant proportion of this is not gift buying at all, but male shoppers buying electricals for themselves.

These days, it’s not unusual to see dozens of amateur photographers all pointing their smartphones in the same direction in a scramble to capture variations of the same shot. But scrums of professional photographers are an old and familiar phenomenon, with competing versions thus existing of many famous images. So what helps one picture stand out from the crowd?One of photographer Martin Jenkinson’s best-known pictures shows a protesting miner, wearing a toy policeman’s helmet, squaring up to a line of police officers. The black and white image holds both a playful humour and tension in its frame, pitting the lone protester in his parodic outfit against the dark block of officers facing him, one of whom looks directly at the lens. The image was taken at the Battle of Orgreave, a pivotal 1984 miners’ protest in which the police outnumbered demonstrators. Some officers, many argue, used excessive force. sent its own photographer, Don McPhee, to cover the event on the same day, and one of the images he came back with is very similar to Jenkinson’s. The framing is tighter and the protester looks directly into the eyes of the policeman facing him, lending a clearer air of confrontation to the image: Jenkinson and McPhee must have been standing only a few feet away from each other when these near-simultaneous photos were taken.There are many similar instances in the history of news photography. The famous image dubbed “tank man” of the lone protester facing down a line of tanks during the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing in 1989 exists in shots by five photographers. Charlie Cole and Stuart Franklin took the image from the same balcony of the Beijing Hotel, while Jeff Widener and Arthur Tsang Hin Wah captured it from different floors. A barrage of photographers facing every news event has long been commonplace. “Certain events produce so many images that you can get fatigued looking through them all,” says the ’s news picture editor, Karin Andreasson. “Ultimately, you rely on your intuition, which is honed from years of experience.”Louisa Briggs, the curator of the first retrospective of Martin Jenkinson’s work, at Museums Sheffield, believes that the selection process for fine art photography works in a similar way. “When I was first looking though Martin’s photos, it was about a gut reaction,” she says, “and then I’d go back to the selected images and analyse them more. For visitors at an exhibition, they would also respond in a similar way.”The relative merits of the two Orgreave pictures rely on context as much as content. Andreasson prefers McPhee’s: “When looking for a good news picture, you want a strong composition, something that is dynamic, lit well and clean,” she says. “The McPhee has a wonderful direction of eye contact and a tighter crop, which lends an immediacy to it, whereas there is less of a sense of confrontation in the Jenkinson image. McPhee tells the story better, although both images show the fact that there is more than one truth to a story.”Capturing a different kind of story is what makes the Jenkinson image enticing to Briggs. “Since Martin was the National Union of Mineworkers’ photographer, he was based in Orgreave for around a month and won the trust of the miners,” she says. “He had a great rapport with them and could take images that captured the personalities of the people who were part of the strike and that really comes across in his photograph. In Martin’s image, the miner wearing the toy helmet feels more playful – it’s a more complex depiction of the miners’ strike, which often saw families with both policemen and miners in them facing each other.”Briggs adds that no story is ever simple. Jenkinson’s daughter, Justine, apparently told Briggs that the miner went to speak to the policemen because the officer had noticed a cricket badge on the miner’s jacket and so they were joking about the sport together. Jenkinson also took the image “to also document the fact that the policemen weren’t wearing their identification numbers”, Briggs says.“There could have been an element of performance to the images, since both photographers would have been shooting nearby,” Andreasson says, “and so McPhee would have chosen the image that summed up the written story as clearly as possible.”For Briggs, “McPhee is brilliant at that summation – he distils exactly what was going on around the miners’ strike,” and yet she believes Jenkinson chose the more nuanced portrait, “an emotive, human image”.Ultimately, both choosing what to shoot and taking the photograph itself depend on intuition: sensing something momentous or simply remarkable is in the offing and taking the gamble on capturing the precise moment of its happening. That gut reaction might be diluted when surrounded by dozens of others hunting the same thing, but each image is still unique and tells its own story. Even if that might be the fact of all the other photographers clamouring around you to get the perfect Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915c7f208252553f8ff7c565e78897d4ceb3302f/0_0_4000_2670/master/4000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7432172d20cb5033da2ddc74c7f58d8c 720w","title":"nearly 130 public libraries closed across britain in the last year","story":"Services continue to be targets for local authority budget cuts, with remaining services increasingly reliant on voluntary staffAlmost 130 public libraries have closed in the last year in Britain while an extra 3,000 volunteers have been brought in to run remaining services, as the decade’s austerity pressures see local authorities continuing to apply swingeing cuts to budgets.The annual survey of British libraries by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) has revealed a similar picture each year since 2010, with the number of branches and paid staff falling every year.Over the last year, spending on libraries by local authorities fell by £30m to £741m. There was a net loss of 127 public libraries in England, Wales and Scotland, while 712 full-time employees lost or left their jobs and volunteer numbers increased by 3,000, to 51,394.“Community-run” library branches have become the norm in the UK as councils ask volunteers to take the service off their books. In 2010, estimates from Public Libraries News suggest there were only around 10 libraries in the hands of volunteers by 2017, the figure had risen to around 500. Cipfa calculations show that 10,000 new volunteers have joined Britain’s library service over the last three years, increasing from 41,402 in 2014-15 to 51,394 in 2017-18.Rob Whiteman, CEO of Cipfa, said libraries were “a canary in the coal mine for what is happening across the local government sector”.“A lack of funds is forcing many councils to get creative in how they deliver their services, and we find in our public libraries this loss of paid employees is creating a reliance on volunteers,” he said. “Similar cost-shifting is happening across almost all local government services, with communities finding everything from legal aid to green waste collection no longer as accessible. There really need to be some honest conversations about the direction of travel of our councils and what their role is, as the funding gap will continue to exacerbate these issues.”While visitor numbers fell by 10 million this year, to 233 million, the three most popular libraries in Britain – Manchester’s central library, and the Wembley and Woolwich Centre libraries in London – continued to see more than one million people enter their doors last year.Tim Coates, the former managing director of Waterstones and now a library campaigner in the US, said Britain’s woes were unique. “The real heart of the problem with British public libraries is that they are terribly badly operated and managed,” he said. “The decline in use has been going on for over 20 years, since long before the cuts in funding started, and no one in government or the library profession or sector has taken the action needed to improve. There have been literally dozens of ineffective and wasteful reports and initiatives.“The US and Australia show increased use and popularity of their traditional public libraries, so it cannot be true to say that ‘changing technology or changing society’ have caused the decline. If the service is not used it is only reasonable for taxpayers to pay less … People certainly want public libraries, but not in the way they are operated at present. The service is poor. We need a whole change of management.”Nick Poole, chief executive of Cilip, the library and information association, called the figures “a clear wake-up call” and called on the government to use the forthcoming 2019 spending review, announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in October, to invest in libraries once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

Instead of the sensible agreement the prime minister could have negotiated, it is a worst-of-all-worlds deal that works for nobody, whether they voted leave or remain.Instead of taking back control, it gives up control. Instead of protecting jobs and living standards, it puts them at risk by failing to put in place the basis for frictionless trade. For two and a half years the Conservatives have been negotiating with themselves, rather than the European Union. The result has been a lockdown withdrawal agreement, which ties Britain either into extending the transition phase at unknown cost – or tips us into a lopsided backstop agreement from which there is no independent exit. As the legal advice the prime minister tried to prevent us from seeing this week spells out, the backstop would “endure indefinitely” without the say-so of the EU.What that means in practice is that the wish list of the government’s “future partnership” agreement with the EU would remain just that, without the leverage to get a long-term and effective trade deal. Meanwhile, Britain would have no say in either its own customs arrangements or key market regulations. While workers’ rights would be allowed to fall behind, restrictions on state aid to industry would be locked in.May claims this is just an insurance policy. But it’s now clear the backstop is at the heart of her deal. It would leave Britain with no say in a humiliating halfway house which we couldn’t leave without the EU’s permission. There is no precedent I am aware of for a British government signing up to an international treaty it cannot withdraw from without the agreement of other countries. It is clearly unacceptable.The only reason the government has agreed such a convoluted package is to manage the warring factions of the Tory party. But it has failed. Instead it has united Conservative leavers and remainers, the DUP and every opposition party against it.This dreadful deal must be defeated when it is put to the vote next week. We are working with MPs and parties across the House of Commons not only to ensure it is rejected, but also to prevent any possibility of a no-deal outcome.But its defeat cannot be taken for granted. In an effort to drag Tory MPs back onside, May is claiming that defeat for her deal means no deal or no Brexit, because there is no viable alternative. That is false. Labour’s alternative plan would unlock the negotiations for our future relationship with the EU and allow us to move away from such a damaging backstop.A new, comprehensive customs union with the EU, with a British say in future trade deals, would strengthen our manufacturing sector and give us a solid base for industrial renewal under the next Labour government, especially for our held-back communities. It would remove the threat of different parts of the UK being subject to separate regulations. And it would deal with the large majority of problems the backstop is designed to solve.Second, a new and strong relationship with the single market that gives us frictionless trade, and the freedom to rebuild our economy and expand our public services – while setting migration policies to meet the needs of the economy, not fuelling xenophobia with phoney immigration targets or thresholds – makes far more sense than the prime minister’s dismal deal.Lastly, we want to see guarantees that existing EU rights at work, environmental standards and consumer protections will become a benchmark to build on – not fall behind and undercut other countries at our people’s expense. These rights and protections, whether on chlorinated chicken or paid holidays, are what people actually want. But the government is determined to trade them away in a race to the bottom.Labour has very different priorities. Our alternative plan would ensure an open border in Ireland, provide security for investment, give our manufacturing sector a springboard for renewal, ensure we have the powers to rebuild our economy and public services and guarantee world-beating support for workers, consumers and our environment. We are absolutely committed to internationalist cooperation and anti-racist solidarity across Europe, in or out of the EU, and determined to ensure opportunities for students to study in other countries are protected.Unlike the Norway-plus option now being canvassed among MPs, our plan would not leave Britain as an across-the-board rule-taker of EU regulations without a say. It’s a plan that can be negotiated with the EU, even at this late stage, with most of the building blocks already in place. The EU has shown it is prepared to renegotiate even more complex agreements than this, such as the Lisbon treaty. And ours is a plan I believe could command a majority in parliament and bring the country together.The stakes could not be higher next week. If the prime minister’s deal is defeated, the government will have lost its majority on the most important issue facing the country and lost its ability to govern. The best outcome in those circumstances would be to let the country decide on the way ahead and the best team to lead it. That means a general election.In the past, a defeat of such seriousness as May now faces would have meant an automatic election. But if under the current rules we cannot get an election, all options must be on the table. Those should include Labour’s alternative and, as our conference decided in September, the option of campaigning for a public vote to break the deadlock. Two years ago, people voted remain because they wanted an open, international relationship with Europe and a multicultural society. Many voted leave out of anger at the way the political class had left them behind, with crumbling infrastructure and low-paid, insecure jobs. Our job is to unite people with a plan that works for the whole country.Given the decisions taken in parliament this week, it should now be easier to build support for an alternative plan to bring the country together. The government’s deal must not stand. In those circumstances parliament has shown it is ready to take control, and Labour will give the leadership the country needs.• Jeremy Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, is the leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068342df29b3686613549b7861c0e0815af91877/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49f7a5b602b8d0d2e993c4e7e40a96e","title":"republicans are staging mini coups across the us","story":"An 11th-hour tactic in Wisconsin is an attack on progressive causes and the integrity of the electoral processDemocracies empower the will of majorities. In the US, Republican lawmakers on both the state and national level have rejected that basic principle.In a lame-duck session in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Republican legislators in the state of Wisconsin passed a sweeping bill designed to radically check the powers of the incoming governor. The result of this 11th-hour tactic is an attack on progressive causes, the integrity of the electoral process, and democratic accountability.Last month, Democrat Tony Evers won the state gubernatorial race, unseating Republican incumbent Scott Walker. Among other things, Evers, who made affordable healthcare a key issue in the race, promised to withdraw Wisconsin from yet another tiresome suit against provisions of Obamacare. But the Republican bill would strip him of the power to do so.Evers also made gun control a central issue of the campaign, promising to ban guns from the Wisconsin Capitol. No, the legislators now say, you can’t do that.Evers promised to clean up Wisconsin’s “Economic Development Corporation”. Created by Governor Walker, the EDC is the kind of scandal-ridden, crony-stacked organization that the great Republican senator from Wisconsin Robert La Follette once labored tirelessly to expose and reform. But now legislators have acted to undermine the governor’s power to regulate the wasteful and arguably corrupt corporation.However disgraceful, the power grab by Wisconsin’s Republican legislators is hardly idiosyncratic. Hard on the heels of Democrat Roy Cooper’s capturing the governorship of North Carolina in 2016, Republican legislators in that state voted to aggressively limit the governor’s power. Last month, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer captured the governor’s seat in Michigan, trouncing her Republican opponent by 10 percentage points. Lame-duck Republican legislators are now scheming to strip the state’s highest executive of essential powers. On the national level, Senate Republicans stunningly refused to so much as grant Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to the supreme court, a hearing.Pundits have described these actions as Republicans playing “hardball”, though the description obscures a noxious reality: Republicans aren’t playing ball at all – they are rejecting the basic rules of the game. The notion that elections count only when our side wins is nothing short of a repudiation of democracy. Republicans, on both the national and state level, are essentially staging minor coups.If Republicans no longer respect the rules of the democratic process, then they must be forced to pay a political price for their arrogance. And yet Republicans have been largely insulated from paying this price thanks to the success of an even more audacious campaign to nullify the peoples’ will.Hyper-partisan gerrymandering is perhaps the most radically anti-democratic fixture of our present political reality. We should all, then, be encouraged by one of most consequential, but largely overlooked, results of last month’s midterms.Voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado and Utah passed ballot initiatives emphatically rejecting such gerrymandering. They endorsed the creation of non-partisan redistricting commissions or otherwise voted to limit the power of a controlling party to unilaterally draw electoral maps.We can only hope that these efforts will spread and succeed, spelling the end of radical Republican efforts to ignore the will of the majority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff31f36861e338c394b159e515e3fb6de043b518/0_0_2225_1335/master/2225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4788cabb7880d98e48660b8a26d61199","title":"the guardian view on the brexit backstop getting ireland wrong again","story":"Ostensibly, Theresa May went on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday to address all the listeners. In reality, however, her aim was to reach an audience of fewer than 200. The people she wanted to influence are the Conservative MPs who hold her government’s future in their hands next Tuesday in the votes on her Brexit deal.Mrs May’s pitch was narrowly focused. She was now “talking to colleagues” about ways in which parliament might be involved in activating the Northern Ireland backstop – a clause in the withdrawal agreement whose purpose is to prevent the return of a physical border in Ireland following the post-Brexit transition between March 2019 and December 2020. MPs might, she suggested, be able to choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition a bit further. Translated, this meant that Mrs May wanted to appear open to marginal changes in her Brexit deal as a means of persuading some doubters to vote for it next week.It was abjectly thin stuff. It was not anything that can plausibly be presented as a tweak, let alone a renegotiation, of the Brexit deal – because such a thing is not on offer. In fact, these apparent concessions are already part of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. The government’s explanatory document on the agreement, published last month, says as much. It says, in paragraph 157, that Britain could enter the backstop or opt for a transition extension: “This would allow the UK government, with an appropriate role for parliament, to consider the right approach in the national interest.” Mrs May, in other words, used her interview to offer a nicely wrapped version of something that has already been agreed.Logically, this might seem to mean that Mrs May will not succeed with this approach to her backbenchers. This is, though, to underestimate the pressures on Tory MPs. Ordinarily, they – and their local activists – want to support the prime minister and her government. It remains the case that a minority of Tory MPs are so entrenched in their views for or against Brexit that their votes against her deal were locked down from the start of the whole process. That is why, until this week, Mrs May won almost every key vote.Her problem now is with the backbench MPs who dislike both the deal itself and the fuss it has caused, and who have persuaded themselves, looking at the parliamentary arithmetic and at the hints that the deal could be tweaked, that they have permission to vote against the deal without bringing the government down. Pressure on these MPs will tighten over the weekend and right up to the vote on Tuesday. On Thursday one former pro-European Tory critic, Antoinette Sandbach, agreed to back Mrs May with the words: “It may not be perfect but it is a good deal.” She is very unlikely to be the last to change her mind. But the larger problem for Mrs May is that she is fighting on two fronts, against anti-EU fanatics who abhor every continuing post-Brexit tie with Europe, and against pro-EU remainers who see a chance of overturning the 2016 referendum.If nothing else, this is an example of English Toryism’s chickens coming home to roost. The leave campaign in England utterly ignored the warnings in 2016 from Sir John Major, Tony Blair and others about the disruptions that Brexit could bring to Ireland. Northern Irish voters, where a majority chose to remain, could not be so dismissive. But Mrs May then ignored warnings that a post-election deal with the DUP – a party fundamentally out of step on Brexit with majority opinion in Northern Ireland and the Republic – would come back to haunt her. Not for the first time in British history the Tory party is again faced with a choice between protecting its narrow interests and what Sir Robert Peel, at the height of the Corn Law crisis, called the need to “understand this Irish case”. Peel did. Mrs May doesn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2932619e68dbb2c6edb2360288947c322b634321/0_0_941_576/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b524ddcf32b026f70af21e6c41f77b52 645w","title":"inadequate steiner school to be taken over by academy chain","story":"State-funded Steiner Academy Exeter is seeking a new sponsor after damning Ofsted reportA state-funded Steiner school in Devon is to be transferred to a multi-academy trust after the schools watchdog said it was inadequate.Ofsted inspectors raised serious concerns about safeguarding and lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) at the Steiner Academy Exeter, which opened in September 2013.The academy is one of a small number of Steiner schools set up as a result of the government’s controversial free school policy and paid for by public funds. Other Steiner schools in the UK are privately funded.The Department for Education published a letter on Thursday confirming that the school, which teaches children between the ages of four and 16, has been issued with a termination warning notice by Lisa Mannall, regional schools commissioner for south-west England. The acting principal confirmed that the school would be rebrokered and taken over by a new sponsor.Following a visit by Ofsted in October, the school was temporarily closed because of the seriousness of the concerns raised. The inspectors’ subsequent report was damning, accusing leaders of failing to ensure the safety and wellbeing of pupils. “Significant lapses in safeguarding practice continue to put pupils at risk,” it said.The report described the leadership at all levels in the school as dysfunctional it said pupils with Send were disproportionately excluded from school, and said additional funding for disadvantaged pupils had been misspent and had no impact on their achievement.Inspectors also criticised inadequate teaching and low attendance, particularly among Send pupils and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The report added: “Leaders have failed to shape a curriculum that combines the Steiner approach with the requisite academic learning that pupils need to succeed in their studies.”Steiner education is based on the teachings of Austria-born Rudolf Steiner who developed a spiritual philosophy called anthroposophy and remains highly controversial in the UK, with organisations including the British Humanist Association vehemently opposed to state funding for such schools.The school re-opened a few days after it was closed. The acting principal of the Steiner Academy Exeter, Paul Hougham, said changes had already been made to raise standards following the Ofsted inspection. He said: “Robust measures to improve the school were already in place before the notification from the Department for Education and we are in regular contact with DfE officials to demonstrate the progress that has been made over the past two months.“As part of this process the school will be formally rebrokered, which means that the regional schools commissioner will be inviting tenders from existing multi-academy trusts who are interested in adopting the school within their fold.“At the heart of the reorganisation, already well under way, is a seismic shift in the consistency and level of rigour and responsiveness of our focus on the quality of children’s education and wellbeing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496ce1b9b784a8c01a7b459f666aab2cd5679358/41_30_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0608621381fcf2bd504dd2ace595f2f1","title":"eton and westminster among eight schools dominating oxbridge","story":"Research shows pupils from state sector less likely to apply than privately educated peersEight top schools in the UK get as many pupils into the universities of Oxford and Cambridge as three-quarters of all schools and colleges together, according to new research.Over a three-year period the eight leading schools – which are mainly in the independent sector – sent 1,310 of their students to Oxbridge, while 2,900 schools, each with two or fewer acceptances, sent 1,220 pupils in total.The research showed that high-flying pupils from state schools were far less likely to apply to Oxbridge than their peers in the private sector, and were less likely to be successful when they did apply.Researchers, using data gathered by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), found that students who attended a private school were seven times more likely to win a place at Oxford or Cambridge than those in non-selective state schools.They were also more than twice as likely to go to a Russell Group university. Six of 10 private school students who were in higher education were at a Russell Group university, compared with just under a quarter of pupils from comprehensives and sixth-form colleges.The Access to Advantage study by the Sutton Trust, a charity promoting social mobility through education, analysed university applications and acceptance rates for three years starting in 2015, looking at the type of school pupils attended and the regions where they lived. According to the report, one of the reasons a tiny number of schools continue to dominate Oxbridge admissions is the high level of additional, specialist, support for pupils, which cannot be matched in the state sector.At Westminster school, which sends 70 to 80 students to Oxbridge each year, pupils are given personalised mentoring and university preparation classes.At Eton, which sends 60 to 100 students to Oxbridge each year, a dedicated universities officer is “available at any time during the A-level years for interviews with boys or parents”. St Paul’s boys’ school employs 11 specialist UK university advisers – in 2016, 53 of the school’s 189 students who went to university got into either Oxford or Cambridge.The Sutton Trust is calling for universities to make greater use of contextual data in their admissions process, including reduced grade offers, to recognise the different circumstances of applicants. It also says all pupils should receive professional careers advice to help them make the best informed choicesChris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the universities regulator, the Office for Students, said the Sutton Trust research highlighted a “‘clear and unacceptable gap in equality of opportunity” for young people from different school backgrounds and regions.Matt Waddup, head of policy and campaigns at the University and College Union, said: “This report demonstrates that many talented youngsters will never get into some universities simply because nobody is pushing them to consider applying to them. Universities need to help students from backgrounds and schools that don’t traditionally apply to some universities by looking at contextual data.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe6fe99102ebcd3264d29f7cf20f78f1abf1dcc/1_693_1871_1122/master/1871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da66cda3b4fd1f038257f8e5de8a3095","title":"december dressing outfit inspiration for the month ahead","story":"The temperature may ebb and the rains may come, but you’re guaranteed a baseline of chilliness this month.

Leading the field with six nods, including actor and director, is Adam McKay’s enjoyable, if flashily self-aware political comedy Vice, with its glowering portrayal of former vice-president, big oil nabob and war-on-terror enthusiast Dick Cheney, who the film shows effectively leading America throughout the presidency of George W Bush.Christian Bale has put on considerable amounts of weight and latex for the role and the result is undoubtedly entertaining, although I wonder if the surge of enthusiasm for this movie represents a guilty rush of liberal nostalgia for the good old days when the Republican bad guys, however horrible, were smart and rational people who had the good taste to keep a relatively low profile, and you kind of knew where you stood with them. The movie actually finishes with a post-credits sting which makes the director’s attitude to the new Trumpian zeitgeist and its standard of political debate pretty clear. Amy Adams is also up for best supporting actress for her performance as Cheney’s formidable wife Lynne, and Sam Rockwell for his amiable, undemanding and more subtly latexed turn as Dubya himself.Behind the six nominations for Vice is four apiece for Yorgos Lanthimos’s exhilaratingly mad post-Restoration romp The Favourite with its outstanding performance from Olivia Colman Peter Farrelly’s Green Book, starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen as a classical pianist and his driver and Bradley Cooper’s brilliant and extravagant sugar-rush remake of A Star Is Born. Of these, the most prominent is obviously A Star Is Born, with its wonderful lead performance from Lady Gaga. Warner Bros has – perhaps a little over-solemnly – entered A Star Is Born in the Globes’ “drama” section rather than “musical or comedy”. Obviously, it isn’t funny and it is dramatic, but I would have liked to see this film honoured for its all-important musical content. Surely its song Shallow is going to walk off with best song, and as for the rest, who can tell? I love it, but A Star Is Born could yet find itself pipped at a number of posts, and in the best picture (drama) category, Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk might have the edge.The Favourite is a jagged, sharp-clawed picture which has snagged the attention of everyone who has seen it, since it opened on the festival circuit at the end of the summer and praising it has become de rigueur among opinion-makers. It’s based on real-life figures from the English court – which could have been given a very square bonnets-and-ruffles period-drama treatment, but which Lanthimos’s unique style elevates to a quite different kind of absurdist spectacle. Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne is a thing of joy.Green Book is based on a true story: the relationship between classical pianist Don Shirley (Ali) and his Italian-American driver and bodyguard Tony Vallelonga (Mortensen) in the 60s. It’s a heart-in-the-right-place movie which could find itself doing well, but I think it will be crowded out in the end.Elsewhere, it is impossible not to see a couple of outrageous snubs. Ari Aster’s superlative scary movie Hereditary didn’t get into the best film (drama) category well, all right, but surely Toni Collette deserved a shot at best actress for her superb performance? Well, at all events, it is great to see Glenn Close in that category for her subversively enigmatic literary spouse in The Wife. That surely has to be favourite. Also, it’s great that John C Reilly has been nominated for his (excellent) performance as Oliver Hardy in Jon S Baird’s Stan \u0026amp Ollie – though not nominating Steve Coogan, who played Stan Laurel, is just silly.On now to the subject of the film which most believe to be the very best of the year: Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma: this has screenplay, director and best foreign language film – although its status as a foreign-language film appears to have ruled it out of the best film categories. I think Cuarón deserves best director, although I wonder if he might get beaten out of the best foreign-language spot by the more obviously heart-tugging Capernaum, by Nadine Labaki, though I have to admit to not sharing the dewy-eyed praise for that film.Elsewhere, Bohemian Rhapsody has done very well with a best actor (drama) nod for Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury and even a best drama nomination. Those are nominations which are interestingly in tune with a current of popular opinion which really likes this film, and which is impatient with critical voices who found it bland or straightwashed.And ever since Ryan Coogler’s highly entertaining superhero movie Black Panther, the debate has been whether the awards establishment can find a way to honour its overwhelming success. The Globes, with their unstuffy tradition of recognising movies which are not solemn awards-bait, would be the place, but Black Panther has not in fact dominated the field.Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman has been coolly picking up praise and enthusiasm since it emerged at Cannes back in May. Now its nominations include best director for Lee himself, best drama and best actor for John David Washington. I was agnostic about it, but this is a movie whose awards momentum could yet pick up.For me, this years Globes “silly” vote goes to Mary Poppins Returns with a very respectable set of nods for best musical or comedy, actress (for Emily Blunt) and actor (Lin-Manuel Miranda). Hmmm. MPR isn’t bad, and it has some lovely showstoppers at the very beginning. But the confectionery really isn’t that nutritious or appetising by the end.So a reasonable Globes list, with the surreal prospect of Dick Cheney squaring off with Lady Gaga for the big prizes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8538aaa7f4970370d76cf56ea74c1d573cb67094/220_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15882fb2fa12a3173a3a1d22211c9c14","title":"golden globes 2019 vice leads pack with six nominations","story":"Adam McKay’s comedy starring Christian Bale as Dick Cheney picks up most nods. A Star Is Born, The Favourite and Green Book each take five – while Widows and Sorry to Bother You are among high-profile snubsDick Cheney may never have officially ruled over America, but Vice, a new biopic about the power-hungry politician, is the surprise leader going into next year’s Golden Globe awards. The comedy stars Christian Bale – who gained 40lb and wears a bald-cap for the role – as George W Bush’s deputy, and has been nominated for best actor, best director, best motion picture (comedy or musical), best screenplay, best supporting actor (for Sam Rockwell, who plays Bush), and best supporting actress (for Amy Adams, who plays Cheney’s wife Lynne).The film is the Anchorman director Adam McKay’s follow-up to the financial smash The Big Short, which was up for four Globes and five Oscars a couple of years ago – but converted them into only one win.Set to open later this month in the US, Vice beat predicted frontrunner A Star Is Born, which, having already stormed both the box office and pop charts, was expected today to launch its assault proper on awards season. But in the end, Bradley Cooper’s remake of the classic Hollywood saga had to make do with nods for himself as actor and director, best original song (for Shallow), best leading actress in a drama for Lady Gaga, and best drama.Warner Bros’ decision to enter the film in the drama category rather than “comedy or musical” was controversial but signals its intention to push the title for major awards this season, rather than risk relegation on the basis it might not be sufficiently heavyweight. Universal Pictures has followed suit, trying the same tactic with Bohemian Rhapsody, its Freddie Mercury biopic starring Rami Malek which picked up two nominations.The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos’s black comedy set in the court of Queen Anne, got nominations for screenplay, comedy, leading actress Olivia Colman and supporting actresses Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone.Green Book got the same number of nods. The road-trip comedy starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali has come under fire for what some perceive as a whitewashed version of racial history, but it is performing well with audiences and took the Toronto People’s Choice award in September – a gong previously won by the likes of Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave and The King’s Speech, each of which went on to win the best picture Oscar.Mary Poppins Returns and BlacKkKlansman performed better than expected with four nominations apiece (including Emily Blunt for her leading role in the former) Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk and the Marvel movie Black Panther took three apiece. Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma – the film topping most critics’ best-of-2018 lists – also took three: best screenplay, best director and best foreign-language film.Three of this year’s five best drama nominees – BlacKkKlansman, Black Panther and If Beale Street Could Talk – are films by black directors featuring largely black casts. The spread of acclaim was by and large wider than expected, with surprise nominations for smaller titles such as gritty cop drama Destroyer, Diablo Cody’s post-natal depression comedy Tully, Bo Burnham’s debut Eighth Grade and the Vincent Van Gogh biopic Eternity’s Gate, potentially at the expense of big-hitters such as First Man – the moon landings drama starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong – which took just two nominations.Widows, Steve McQueen’s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, was arguably the greatest casualty – it scored no nominations, not even for much fancied leading actress Viola Davis. Boots Riley’s acclaimed satire Sorry to Bother You also went unrecognised. As did Clint Eastwood’s on-screen swansong The Mule, Hugh Jackman-starring political comedy The Front Runner, historical drama Mary, Queen of Scots and the Ruth Bader Ginsberg biopic On the Basis of Sex.Cold War, the new film from Ida director Paweł Pawlikowski, was also snubbed, as was First Reformed, Paul Schrader’s return to form starring Ethan Hawke as an anguished priest.Brits performed well across the board in the film acting categories: as well as nominations for Colman, Weisz and Blunt, Rosamund Pike was recognised for her work playing foreign correspondent Marie Colvin in A Private War, while Richard E Grant took a best supporting actor credit for playing Melissa McCarthy’s dissolute friend in Can You Ever Forgive Me?There was a strong British showing in the television portion of the awards. The BBC fact-based drama A Very English Scandal received three nominations: a best limited series nomination, a best actor in a limited series nomination for Hugh Grant for his performance as disgraced Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, and a supporting actor in a limited series nod for Ben Whishaw for his performance as Thorpe’s lover Norman Josiffe.“Very, very kind of the Hollywood Foreign Press. Am opening a jumbo jar of Vaseline in celebration,” Grant wrote on Twitter in response to the nomination.Two other BBC productions, Killing Eve and Bodyguard, received multiple nominations: Killing Eve for best drama and best actress in a drama for star Sandra Oh and Bodyguard for best drama nomination and best actor for star Richard Madden. Madden will face off in that category against Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who was nominated for the final series of The Americans. The 80s spy drama also received a best TV drama nomination and a best TV drama actress nod for Rhys’s partner and co-star Keri Russell.The best actor – limited series category saw Benedict Cumberbatch recognised for his turn as Patrick Melrose in the Sky Atlantic drug-addiction drama of the same name, while Sacha Baron Cohen got a best actor in a comedy nomination for his work on Showtime’s satirical prank show Who Is America. Thandie Newton, meanwhile, received a supporting actress drama nod for her performance in Westworld.Hollywood talent was also well accounted for in the TV categories, with Julia Roberts claiming a best actress – drama nomination for paranoid thriller Homecoming, and Amy Adams and Penelope Cruz both receiving best actress – limited series nods for Sharp Objects and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, respectively. Laura Dern was recognised for her performance in the HBO child abuse drama The Tale, while Jim Carrey’s turn as a slowly unravelling children’s TV host in Showtime’s Kidding earned him a best comedy actor nod, and Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin were nominated for best actor comedy and best supporting actor comedy respectively for their roles as bickering old friends in Netflix sitcom The Kominsky Method.Other series to receive multiple nominations included the Ben Stiller-directed prison break drama Escape at Dannemora, acclaimed Margaret Atwood adaptation The Handmaid’s Tale, the Ryan Murphy-produced trans rights drama Pose, and Amazon comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel.In addition to the regular nominations came the announcement of a new honorary award for achievement in television. The award, which is as yet unnamed, will act as the TV equivalent of the Globes’ Cecil B De Mille Award, which recognises “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment”.The Globes reputation as an Oscars bellwether has diminished in recent years, with the organisation increasingly erging in its choices from the Academy. The makeup of both bodies’ voters also starkly contrasts, since the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences increased the number and ersity of its members in recent years. Earlier this year, the Academy invited a record number of new members, adding 928 to the 6,500 or so already in the club. Following the #OscarsSoWhite controversy in 2016, the body committed to doubling its number of women and erse members by 2020.The Globes, meanwhile, are voted for by 90 entertainment journalists based in Los Angeles but writing for international publications. Their identities have long been mysterious, but one of their number, Aida Tekla, came to notoriety earlier this year after an idiosyncratic interview she purportedly conducted with Drew Barrymore ran in EgyptAir’s inflight magazine.Last year’s Globes were dominated by Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which took best drama, best original screenplay, best actress in a drama and best supporting actor, while Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird won best comedy or musical and best actress in a comedy or musical for Saoirse Ronan. The Oscars, meanwhile, gave best picture (and best director) to Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water, while Three Billboards took best actress and best supporting actor. Lady Bird went home empty-handed.This year’s nominations were read out by actors Terry Crews, Leslie Mann, Christian Slater and Danai Gurira they were joined on stage by Isan Elba, daughter of Idris and this year’s Golden Globe ambassador. The ceremony will take place on 7 January and be co-hosted by Oh (nominated for Killing Eve) and Andy Samberg, whose appointments were announced on Wednesday.This year’s Oscars host was revealed the day before, but the choice of Kevin Hart has met with a mixed reception as his history of apparent homophobia came to light. The Academy Awards will take place on 24 February.• This article was amended on 6 December to correct the spelling of Danai Gurira and a picture caption that mislabelled Christian Slater as Christian Bale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3399f9144230b4fc9b4685d4fbb081c3762e5104/0_99_2596_1558/master/2596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8676eb118cbcf978028d5d6a48a00ff3","title":"movie santa clauses ranked","story":"Ten of the best Hollywood Kris Kringles, from Jim Broadbent (twice) and Billy Bob Thornton to Richard Attenborough and Gene HackmanFor the veteran supporting actor – who would go on to play a certain big Lebowski – this must have seemed like a welcome headlining role, even if the plot revolves round Dudley Moore’s wide-eyed elf being seduced by capitalism. Still, Huddleston brings bags of earthy jollity.In this plucky but overlooked Britcom, a crash-landed Santa gets banged up by mistake. Can ex-con Rafe Spall break him out in time to save Christmas? A never-cuddlier Broadbent twinkles in both full red-and-white regalia and drab prison denims.In the best of the contract-focused festive franchise, Santa must leave the north pole to find a wife – long story – so clones himself to keep toy production ticking over. It’s a double role for Allen who gets to show his range and, when the pair fall out, punch himself in the face.The perma-stoned H\u0026ampK movies have a very loose grasp on reality so when a jovial but sly Santa turns up – in the form of stocky character actor Riehle – it seems perfectly plausible that he made it his mission to reunite these estranged buddies via a giant spliff.In this animated fantasy, Saint Nick assembles an Avengers-style superteam of childhood icons to battle a nightmare king. A likeable festive berserker, this Santa boasts “Naughty” and “Nice” sleeve tattoos, wields dual sabres and has Baldwin doing a truly go-for-broke Russian accent.So, have you been naughty or nice? If it’s the former, Hackman’s tenacious stakeout Santa will chase you down a street, beat you with a cosh from his boot and then baffle you into spilling your guts by asking if you’ve ever been to Poughkeepsie.Netflix’s latest attempt to monopolise the Christmas movie market is a dud overall, but Russell channels every ounce of his square-jawed charisma to embody a swaggering Santa with a red leather jacket who does a mean Elvis impression.Technically, Jim Broadbent voices Santa in Aardman’s crammed CGI fable. But the real standout is Nighy, who drops his usual effortless urbanity to play the cackling, gurning Santa Sr, who helps his gormless grandkid save Christmas the old-fashioned way.The original bawdy ballad of Willie Stokes – a selfish career criminal who dons the fur-trimmed costume for an annual scam – remains surprisingly heartwarming without ever becoming too treacly, the perfect vehicle for Thornton’s ratbag charm.Disreputable Santas who subvert the jolly stereotype can be fun but sometimes you just want a crinkly Kringle with half-moon glasses and a white beard who can remind everyone – even lawyers! – about the magic of Christmas. Purists might prefer the 1947 original, but the visually rich 1994 remake bathes the avuncular Attenborough in a warm glow and really makes that red suit pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc0039574e40d3604cefb780c1733c0dad47c22/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f5864d395aac2cc611090824566c2a7","title":"the miracle of sissy spacek why its time to rediscover her genius","story":"She stars in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, but all the film’s publicity has been about Robert Redford. Anyone who hasn’t encountered her earlier performances is in for a treatTroubling news just in of a well-known comic in his early 30s, who approached a friend of mine at a party and squinted at his T-shirt. “What does that say?” he asked. “S-I-S-S-Y S-P-A-C-E-K?” (It was one of those Girls on Tops-style affairs, with the name of a female actor or film-maker emblazoned in capital letters.) An explanation, including the words “Carrie” and “Badlands” and possibly “acting legend”, was forthcoming, but the baffled celebrity was none the wiser. Could it be that the miracle of Sissy Spacek has eluded an entire generation?Spacek’s pace has admittedly slowed down in the past decade. Her last Oscar nomination was 16 years ago, for her performance as a grieving mother in the revenge drama In the Bedroom. She was a regular a few years back on Bloodline, a Netflix smash full of noirish foreboding and corkscrew twists, in which she played Mum to bad boy Ben Mendelsohn. And now she is in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, AKA the Robert Redford Retirement Movie, where she shows off her flirting abilities, her translucent and infinitely freckled skin, and even one of her own off-screen catchphrases, “Keep on keepin’ on,” all the while seeming vaguely underused.Spacek’s characteristic pensiveness is also on display in the new film. She can be vividly in the moment – think of her as the woman fighting to find her husband in Missing, set during the 1973 Chilean coup d’état – but her default setting is contemplation. Few actors can look so fascinating staring into space. As the country and western singer Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner’s Daughter, the film that won her the best actress Oscar, she has plenty of reason to gaze into the middle distance, imagining a life that would lift her out of hardship. The British director Michael Apted, who knew the value of patience from his work on the seminal Up documentary series, kept coming back to that face. You would offer more than a penny for her thoughts.That was 1980. But she had been brilliant right off the bat seven years earlier in Terrence Malick’s debut Badlands, an intoxicatingly lyrical real-life crime drama about a dopey killer, Kit (Martin Sheen), and his teenage girlfriend, Holly, played by Spacek at her dreamiest and most distracted. Character and actor, both Texan, became fused at a molecular level. “People who’ve worked with Terry either love him or hate him,” Spacek recalled. “I love him. We’d spend hours talking about things, and then the next day I’d look at the rewrites, and there’d be all the things I told him.” She said she could twirl batons and, sure enough, there it was in black and white the next day: “Holly twirls a baton.”Badlands was an interminable shoot, with the whimsical Malick prone to abandon the day’s schedule whenever he became distracted by this sunset or that river, taking off to film over there instead. Crew members quit. (The movie has three credited cinematographers.) But Spacek and the production designer Jack Fisk stuck it out. “I had a vested interest,” said Fisk. “I’d fallen in love with Sissy, so that also kept me going.” (The couple are still married.) Although her acting career was fully underway, she could be found helping out on Fisk’s jobs: she held the clapperboard on David Lynch’s Eraserhead and decorated sets on Brian De Palma’s gaudy horror-comedy Phantom of the Paradise.De Palma used her on Carrie for more than just her knack with an undercoat. For her luminous performance as the pale, terrified schoolgirl waking up to her terrifying powers, Spacek got the first of her six best actress Oscar nominations. The contorted poses she strikes during her telekinetic episodes – like a mix of kabuki and voguing – came from studying the dramatic biblical drawings that formed part of her husband’s research for his production design on the film.Carrie marked the start of her celebrity but also an end of sorts. She could pass for a teenager until she was almost 30 – she was 27 when she played Carrie – but during the 1980s she graduated to adult roles, including a run of rural dramas such as The River, Places in the Heart and the unsettling Raggedy Man. Even her smallest parts are comprised of fine, tender brushstrokes: one of her best is as the shy, stammering Rose in David Lynch’s The Straight Story. She doesn’t have more than 10 minutes of screentime, but her compassion and chiming sadness resonate throughout the picture.Spacek can also be blissfully dotty. She provides the voice of Anne Uumellmahaye, the brain with which Steve Martin becomes smitten in The Man With Two Brains (he takes her out on a rowboat and slaps a pair of wax lips on her jar). And she matches Christopher Walken quirk-for-quirk in Blast from the Past, where they play a couple who have been holed up in a fallout shelter for 35 years.As extraordinary as Badlands, Carrie and Coal Miner’s Daughter remain, I would point the oblivious and the unbelieving in the direction of the most spaced-out Spacek movie: Robert Altman’s eerie 3 Women. The film’s first half, with Spacek as the timid, impressionable Pinky being bossed around and jollied along by her garrulous roommate (Shelley Duvall), is the closest thing US cinema has produced to a Mike Leigh-style comedy of social awkwardness. In the second half, identities become blurred and exchanged, and those of us previously reassured by Spacek’s sweetness start to lose our bearings as the characters lose their marbles. For all the havoc Carrie wreaks, she is always sympathetic she only kills when cornered. But 3 Women, released only a year later in 1977, hinted at parts of Spacek that might be unknowable, even duplicitous. That face could never again seem purely placid.The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd21fed4f6390ebc6efa522871c7ac6a73e716b/1656_555_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c870f6a08d6f5ac97bf95795059ee8","title":"frenkie de jong ajax manchester city barcelona","story":"“It’s crazy when people like you come all the way from England,” Frenkie de Jong says with a sincerity that suggests he really is struggling to understand why anyone would board a plane just to interview him.De Jong offers a bashful smile and for a moment it almost feels as if he has a point as we sit in the noisy canteen at Ajax’s training ground. Maybe it is time to stop the tape and give this pleasant young man some space.There is a good reason for making the journey, though, not to mention something disarming about meeting a rising talent who seems tickled by the hype surrounding him. On a light Amsterdam afternoon, De Jong’s modesty shines through. He is reassuringly normal for a 21‑year‑old who has been called – deep breath now – the new Johan Cruyff, the new Franz Beckenbauer and the future of Dutch football. Barcelona are linked with him on a daily basis but Manchester City also want a new midfield technician.Some say De Jong is a No 6, some a No 8. Others view him as a No 10, because he treats the ball like his oldest friend, and he has also been likened to Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard after impressing as a sweeper. But it is the comparisons with Cruyff that make him most uncomfortable.“I feel honoured,” De Jong says. “But I don’t think you can compare the two of us. He is so much better than me. He had so much quality. I will never reach that level. I don’t want to compare myself to Cruyff. And I think people who do that don’t want me to compare to Cruyff, they just see similarities in us. But not the same qualities. I watch his videos and he was amazing the way he moved with the ball, the way he saw the game.”De Jong’s caution is understandable. Plenty of self‑proclaimed future Ballon d’Or winners have made life difficult for themselves by talking too much and he is determined not to fall into that trap. It is a long climb to the top.They already adore him in Amsterdam, though. Even people without any interest in football have heard of De Jong, who is revered for his passing, skill and footballing intellect. He is incredibly brave on the ball, which tends to go down well in the Netherlands. This proud football nation has fallen on hard times, failing to qualify for the last two major tournaments, but De Jong’s emergence is one of the reasons why they have fresh hope. Having finished above Germany and France in their Nations League group, Ronald Koeman’s young side will be England’s semi-final opponents at next summer’s finals.De Jong oozed composure when he made his full international debut in the 2-1 away defeat to France three months ago. Typically he corrects a story about Kylian Mbappé asking for his shirt after the game, insisting he initiated the swap with the France forward.Ajax, who have reached the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 13 years, have embraced his talent. Erik ten Hag’s side are in the midst of a romantic resurgence – Ajax will win their group if they beat Bayern Munich on Wednesday – and De Jong gets why people see Cruyff’s spirit in him.“Normally midfielders only pass the ball but I dribble as well,” he says. “People say I take a lot of risks but I don’t think I do, because I don’t lose possession that much.”“Yeah,” he says. “Since I was young I played like this. I don’t think it’s good to become less of what I am now. I have come to the first team playing the way I did when I was a kid. Why change now? Some people say you have to play mature football but the way Lionel Messi plays is mature football as well. He’s just too good for everyone. He can just dribble past them and it looks like his opponents are the kids.“When I am on the pitch I play on intuition but I think a lot about the game as well. With my intuition, it is not just that I receive the ball and always think ‘I’m going to do this’ straight away, even though it just happens that way sometimes.“Most good players play on intuition. Everyone has a little but I don’t know if you can learn it. Sometimes I’m planning. I’m always searching for the pass. I’m always looking to see my teammate. ‘Is he free?’ Then you already know what to do. But sometimes the situation can change. Then you have to react and use your intuition. I try to have a picture when I receive the ball and know where everyone is. That’s one of the most important things for a midfielder.”De Jong’s passion is obvious. He was always playing when he was growing up in Arkel, a village in South Holland, and was never glued to his phone. He joined Ajax in 2015.- Born in Cameroon, he played for the Samuel Eto’o Foundation before joining Barcelona as a 13-year-old. Onana joined Ajax in 2015 and has played almost 100 times for the first team, winning a first senior cap in 2016. Barça and Tottenham are reported to have shown an interest in signing him.- Signed from Rapid Vienna in 2017, Wöber initially struggled to replace Dávinson Sánchez but has started to show his potential as De Ligt’s defensive partner. “I will never be a Sergio Ramos: the bad boy on the field,” he said. “But no one has to fear that I’m afraid.”\u0026nbsp- Made his senior debut for the Netherlands in 2017 having made only two Ereisie appearances for Ajax, whom he joined at the age of nine. Now has 11 caps and is considered one of the best young defenders in the world, with Bayern Munich and Barcelona among the big clubs keeping tabs on him.\u0026nbsp- The attacking right-back was born in the Netherlands but – like teammate Hakim Ziyech – has decided to represent Morocco despite holding talks with Oranje manager Ronald Koeman. Now established as a first‑choice for Erik ten Hag having come through the Jong Ajax system.- Another homegrown product, Van\u0026nbspde Beek began in Ajax’s D team but made his first-team debut in 2015 at the age of 18 and reportedly turned down a move to Roma in the summer. Comfortable in all three midfield positions in Ajax’s customary 4-3-3 formation, he scored 11 league goals last season.- The first recipient of\u0026nbsp the Abdelhak Nouri Trofee, which recognises the best player in the academy, in September the Dutch teenager beat Clarence Seedorf’s record in as the youngest-ever player to appear for Ajax in the Ereisie at just 16 years and 130 days.- Moved to Ajax in January 2017 from São Paulo and broke into the senior side almost immediately. Usually deployed on the right of the front three, the Brazilian scored 14 league goals last season and has attracted interest from Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United despite signing a new deal in September.- Has provoked comparisons with Dennis Bergkamp because of his ice-cool temperament. The Denmark international struggled last season after making his breakthrough in Ajax’s run to the 2017 Europa League final but seems to be finding his form again under Ten Hag.“I like to watch the great players, the ones who are technically good and understand the game,” De Jong says. “I try to see how they move. There are so many I look at, especially the midfielders. You have the guys from Barcelona, the guys from Manchester City. Jorginho at Chelsea now. There are so many to learn from.”Has he seen the criticism Jorginho has received in England for failing to protect Chelsea’s defence this season? “You have to tackle as well,” De Jong says. “You have to do your defensive work but I like to see players who understand the game, players with a lot of vision. Jorginho is one of them.”He cannot hide his admiration for Guardiola’s great Barça side and says Messi is the best because he can do everything. “I love this style. Get the ball back quickly, then play possession with so many combinations. When you watch that, you get the feeling you want to go out on the pitch and play football with your friends and just enjoy yourself. City and Barcelona are great examples.”De Jong has come into his own in the last two years. He was a late substitute when Manchester United beat Ajax 2-0 in the Europa League final in 2017, José Mourinho’s counterattacking tactics cutting through Ajax’s high press. The coach, Peter Bosz, left for Borussia Dortmund shortly after taking them to that first European final in 21 years and after a brief spell with Marcel Keizer in charge, Ten Hag took over in December 2017.Ten Hag knows Guardiola after spending two years as Bayern Munich’s second-team manager. De Jong has enjoyed learning from the 48-year-old and praises his “positive energy” and “great football vision”.The mood is optimistic but beneath the surface uncertainty lingers. Ajax are producing players, with youngsters such as the goalkeeper André Onana, Donny van de Beek, David Neres and Kasper Dolberg catching the eye, but they have not won the league since 2014 and are two points behind PSV Eindhoven at the top of the Ereisie. They have lost Justin Kluivert, Davinson Sánchez and Davy Klaassen in the last two years and there is relentless speculation over Matthijs de Ligt, the elegant 19-year-old centre-back, and De Jong.“It’s difficult to say what will happen,” De Jong says. “I want to finish this season well with Ajax. Then we will see. Maybe I’ll stay for another year, maybe I’ll leave. But I am not sure.”One day it’s Barcelona, the next it’s City. De Jong laughs. “I don’t pay attention to it,” he says. “I hear the stories but I just want to finish this season well.”We talk about Ajax winning three consecutive European Cups in the 1970s and a fourth in 1995. De Jong accepts it will be hard for the current side to recreate those glory days but he is relaxed about the interest in his every move.“I’m just me,” he says. “I try to be kind to everyone. I feel pressure to win but when I am on the pitch I don’t think: ‘Oh, I’m not playing well, the media is going to hammer me.’”We head outside and our photographer tells De Jong he has a lovely smile. His face reddens a little and I tell him he smiles a lot. “I want to enjoy life,” he says. “Be happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7705a7caebd449b81670ed5115c532018312849/0_64_4944_2966/master/4944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b8b6fe70d1a2ea6271bc527310fe819","title":"ralph hasenhuttl southampton premier league rb leipzig","story":"Saints’ new manager has made it clear he is looking to replicate the success enjoyed by his hard-running RB Leipzig sideRalph Hasenhüttl wanted to break it down for the benefit of his new English audience and, also, for his old friend Jürgen Klopp. When the news had hit earlier in the week about the Austrian’s imminent appointment as the Southampton manager, Klopp offered a few pronunciation pointers. “Hasen is the rabbit,” the Liverpool manager said. “Hüttl means nothing.”This was an open goal for Hasenhüttl and he banged it in with relish. “Jürgen’s German is not very good now – maybe his English is better,” he said. “I was laughing about his explaining of my name. He knows what Hasen means but Hüttl means a small hut. So it’s a small hut for the rabbits.”Ralph Rabbithutch has a certain ring to it and so does the nickname that clung to the 51-year-old as he made his way up the German leagues, from Unterhaching and Aalen to Ingolstadt and RB Leipzig – Alpen Kloppen Klopp from the Alps.Hasenhüttl was born two months after Klopp in 1967 and the pair undertook their Uefa pro licence together in Cologne. Like Klopp Hasenhüttl has built his coaching style on pressing, pace, hard running and what he calls automatism – in other words, drilling good decision-making into his players.“Jurgen has a very proactive way to play, he set marks in Germany with his kind of football and that really influenced my style,” Hasenhüttl said. “I have heard about my nickname but I don’t like it so much. I want to be my own character.”Hasenhüttl spoke in perfect English at his Southampton unveiling on Thursday, showing quotable turns of phrase and easy, engaging humour – not only when he was ribbing Klopp. “My goal is to get my name known in the Premier League,” he said. “I want to put my footsteps in the snow.” He made the point that there were no guarantees in football. “If you want a guarantee, buy a washing machine,” he added.What shone through was Hasenhüttl’s conviction, which he said had been hardened by his previous job – the two seasons at RB Leipzig when he finished second and sixth in the Bundesliga. RB Leipzig are the team that many German fans love to hate, because of how Red Bull have thrown money at them to take them from nowhere to the top level.For Hasenhüttl the opportunity at Southampton represents, in his own words, a return to his roots. He was never a top player although, as an old-school centre-forward, he scored goals, particularly for Austria Vienna. He would win eight caps for Austria. He told the story of how he wanted to play in the Premier League but he was not good enough, as he discovered during unsuccessful trials at Chelsea and Bolton Wanderers.“I trained with Chelsea for two weeks under Glenn Hoddle when they were in the relegation zone – it was a long time ago,” Hasenhüttl said. “And I also trained for Bolton when I was a young player. I was very clear, very soon, that I was missing a lot for that level. I had not so much talent and, for that talent, I didn’t do so bad. I could score but running was not my main goal. Maybe that’s why, as a coach, I force my players to run a lot.”Hasenhüttl’s managerial story before RB Leipzig was at lower-end clubs that tended to scrap for survival. Aalen and Ingolstadt were in the relegation places when he took over and Southampton fans will note that he not only led them to survival but also got them both promoted the following season.“This experience helps me a lot, even if it’s a little far away now,” Hasenhüttl said. “Taking the Southampton job is not the easiest step but I never want easy in my life. I am always challenging myself. I am not afraid of anything.”Hasenhüttl will push his new players remorselessly in training. There will also be an emphasis on video sessions which, he said, would “get mind-blowing for the guys”. Tactically he wants to find the perfect formation but to be flexible, too. “My preferred system is 4-2-2-2 but also 4-3-3 and 3-4-3,” he said. “The main goals are to be very proactive and to press very early. If someone says it is too much running or work, they will fall very quickly behind us.”Most immediately, before Saturday’s visit to Cardiff, Hasenhüttl needs to stabilise defensively and lift the collective confidence. Man-management and player development, however, are his greatest strengths. There are no guarantees in football but Hasenhüttl intends to give himself and Southampton the best possible chance through hard work, attention to detail and tried and trusted strategies.Hasenhüttl raised a laugh when asked to reveal his first thought on being offered the job. “It was about how the Titanic left from Southampton,” he replied. “I hope I don’t hit the first iceberg waiting for me.”The reality is that he feels he has found his ideal port."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32db81abca2b1f75656e384b734ae045a6d2738b/0_85_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a5b45746b52574113c18214aaa35a3","title":"west ham fan supporters board democratic football lads alliance","story":"• New group met Karren Brady and other club officials last week• West Ham explain board appointed by independent panelA representative on West Ham United’s newly formed official supporters’ board has placed the club in an awkward position after expressing support for the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, a group condemned by anti-racism campaigners.Greg Smith, who was present when the 18-member OSB held its first meeting with Karren Brady, West Ham’s vice-chairman, and other club officials last week, was asked by the  whether his attendance at October’s DFLA march in London was compatible with his position as a fan representative.Smith, a season-ticket holder at the London Stadium, replied: “I did attend the march in October. I’m opposed to acts of terrorism as a political means of effecting change and marched on that basis.”Smith has previously expressed support for Mark Phillips, the West Ham Under-18s coach who also attended the march. The club suspended Phillips and held an investigation to determine whether his social media activity had broken club rules. He returned to his role in the academy last month after West Ham found there were not sufficient grounds to sack him. They had taken external legal advice from employment specialists.“We were protesting about better treatment for homeless old soldiers as much as Islamic extremism,” Smith told the Sun in October. “I don’t know Mark Phillips but it makes him look like a condemned man before he has a fair trial. The suspension has been a big topic among a lot of West Ham fans who think it’s too much, too soon.”Smith’s comments raise troubling questions for West Ham. The DFLA, a group formed of mainly middle-aged, white, male football fans, had planned a mass march from Park Lane to Whitehall. Organisers said on Facebook they were protesting against “returning jihadists”, “thousands of Awol migrants”, “rape gangs and groomers” and “veterans treated like traitors”. The demonstration descended into violence when anti-racism protesters attempted to block the DFLA’s route. There is no suggestion Smith was involved in any disturbances.The DFLA has been accused of spreading Islamophobia and of having links with far-right organisations. It was set up after the London Bridge terror attack in 2017, has called itself an anti-extremist group and has received support from Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League. The Premier League warned clubs about the DFLA’s growing presence inside stadiums this year.Smith, who is on the OSB to represent 1966 season-ticket holders, also has links with the Real West Ham Fans Group, which was set up last season by Andy Swallow and Micky Morgan, the founder members of the infamous unofficial Inter City Firm. West Ham were accused of failing to respond appropriately after the RWHFG orchestrated an online campaign against the former head of West Ham United Independent Supporters’ Association, a rival fan group.The RWHFG and WHUISA were part of a coalition of 15 fan groups that held meetings with Brady to discuss supporter discontent earlier this year. Smith is one of 18 members on the official supporters’ board, which was set up to improve dialogue with the club following unrest over West Ham’s decision to leave Upton Park for the London Stadium. WHUISA has declined to take part. asked West Ham whether it was appropriate for Smith to remain on the OSB given his support for the DFLA and to explain the process that led to representatives being selected by an independent panel of four, which included Sir Trevor Brooking. The club did not answer questions regarding whether it conducted background checks or reserved the right to veto members.A West Ham spokesperson said: “Members of the official supporters’ board are not appointed by the club, but by an independent panel. The process was open and available to all supporters to apply and applications were anonymised and scored by an independent panel and representatives selected by them. The supporters receiving the highest score in each area were selected as a supporter representative. We do not comment on inidual members.”West Ham received a complaint from a supporter about Smith’s place on the new board last week. A member of supporter services responded: “Panel members were chosen based on their backgrounds within football, supporter experience or because they possessed great knowledge and passion for West Ham.”A spokesman for Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism group, called on West Ham to respond appropriately. “It’s disappointing,” Matthew Collins said. “Perhaps he should have made known to the people electing him that he attended a far-right demonstration. We hope the board at West Ham treat this very seriously. West Ham say they are a proud and inclusive club and that doesn’t appear to be the case with the DFLA.”Smith has stated his aim is to be “a conduit between supporters and the club so there’s a measured and manageable dialogue at all times”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb35fedfa854f4a2e3fa1f18580406564a1a9022/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b88e84554b25575a26d45978f0da387","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Chelsea are fragile before meeting Manchester City, Manchester United at home to the bottom club no longer looks a walkover and will it be same old for Saints despite a new manager?It is far too early for any “I’m Sarri I haven’t a clue” headlines but the past few weeks have given a more accurate impression of the job Chelsea’s manager faces. Their defeat by Wolves was sloppy, particularly given they looked comfortable at 1-0 up, and with an evisceration by Spurs still fresh in the memory Sarri is presented with his first real bump in the road. The odds on things improving this Saturday, when Manchester City visit Stamford Bridge, are unpromising but Sarri has always been aware this would be a rebuilding effort and the squad still requires a mini overhaul if the gap with City is to be closed in the long term. The setback at Molineux proved that Sarri does not yet have the facility to rest key players: Jorginho, who stayed on the bench throughout, was missed and greater depth is surely a priority in January. City may show Chelsea how far there is to go the hope must be that those in the club’s corridors of power are, for once, sympathetic. NAManchester United at home to the league’s bottom club used to be a foregone conclusion. Now it would not be a shock if Claudio Ranieri’s improving Fulham took a point, at least, at Old Trafford. Not only is the result difficult to predict, so is United’s lineup. Because of injuries, inconsistencies and beefs, José Mourinho has continually altered his team this season. The biggest decision he has to make is whether to restore Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku to the starting lineup after both were demoted to the bench for the visit of Arsenal. Will that dropping stimulate Pogba, in particular, to show more dynamism and muscle? It is clear that Pogba does not have the ability to be the all-round midfielder he once aspired to being but if he cannot even bring himself to be a French Mesut Özil, then he will be useless to United, even at home to the bottom club. PDHaving stepped up for Arsenal in the absence of Laurent Koscielny in the early days of Unai Emery’s reign, Rob Holding was stretchered off at Old Trafford with what his manager described as “a big knee injury” that will rule the 23-year-old out for the foreseeable future, possibly the rest of the season. Emery’s preferred system of playing three central defenders leaves him with plenty to ponder as fixtures come thick and fast. Due to make his own return against Qarabag in the Europa League next week, Koscielny may make an early comeback from long-term injury depending on his levels of fitness. Konstantinos Mavropanos is also close to a return from a groin injury but he has made only three appearances for the club. Emery’s other options are to switch to four at the back against Huddersfield on Saturday, or to stick with Stephan Lichtsteiner, who replaced Holding on Wednesday. The wing-back may not be tested too much by David Wagner’s men but is not a viable long-term option. BGRalph Hasenhüttl, Southampton’s fourth manager in two and half seasons, begins his reign against Cardiff on Saturday. Let’s see how long it lasts. The Austrian may have charisma and snazzy ideas but he inherits players who have flunked under several managers, not only Mark Hughes. There has not been a reliable and regularly fit scorer in the squad for a while, and that problem has been compounded this season, in particular, by basic defensive mistakes that sabotage otherwise decent performances. With the club’s invisible majority shareholder, Gao Jisheng, unable or unwilling to invest heavily, Hasenhüttl’s success will depend on his ability to teach long-erratic forwards – or promising youngsters such as Michael Obafemi – to be more clinical and defenders to be more solid. Southampton have more skill than Cardiff but on Saturday Neil Warnock’s side will test the visitors’ capacity to do the fundamentals. PD“Gloriously madcap” is how the ’s Dominic Fifield described Bournemouth’s come-from-behind victory by the odd goal of seven when they stunned Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium a little over two years ago. While Liverpool ran out comfortable winners of both league encounters against Eddie Howe’s side last season, this is a tricky fixture their fans will be viewing with no little trepidation. Ryan Fraser, Joshua King and Callum Wilson are like a similarly menacing cut-price version of Liverpool trio Sadio Mané (an injury concern for this game), Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc with their speed, precision and borderline telepathy. Thirteen of the 18 players selected for the Bournemouth match-day squad that contested the 2016 thriller remain at the club, with two out injured and six likely to be starters. It speaks volumes for the apparent air of serenity around the south coast club and the obvious regard in which Howe is held by those in whom he puts his trust. BGFan boycotts of Premier League football matches are rare, possibly out of concern that the presence of thousands of fans boycotting the boycott demonstrates a lack of unity that is as dispiriting as it is self-defeating for those protesting. Newcastle fans had planned one for their Sunday match against Wolves but unconfirmed reports that Mike Ashley could be about to sell the club prompted the True Faith website to call on supporters to abandon their plans. “A successful takeover will be greatly enhanced by Newcastle United’s Premier League status looking more positive than it does now,” it said. “Therefore it is the agreed editorial position of True Faith to withdraw our support for any match boycott of this game.” Sunday will provide some indication of whether or not fans believe the current talk of the Toon. BGTuesday’s defeat to 10-man Brighton was a reminder to Crystal Palace that just because you can beat Burnley, as Palace did three days earlier, it does not mean you are good enough to avoid relegation. Palace remain ominously blunt up front and on Tuesday the relative defensive solidity on which they had been leaning began to crumble. If that trend continues, they are doomed. Marko Arnautovic’s hamstring injury may be a lucky break for Palace but with Javier Hernández and Lucas Pérez rediscovering their scoring touches in recent games for the Hammers, Roy Hodgson’s side will have to sharpen up to avoid their 16th league match of the season ending in their 10th defeat. PDMarco Silva will have to wait until February before facing the wrath of Vicarage Road but his former club’s visit to Merseyside on Monday night gives extra significance to a fixture between two sides with something to prove. Everton sit sixth, look increasingly impressive under Silva but still drop sloppy points – Newcastle taking one at Goodison Park on Wednesday – and the goals have dried up slightly. Watford are among those placed to challenge for that best-of-the-rest position but their question marks are more pronounced: they have lost four of their last five, and the talk of a Javi Gracia-fuelled revolution has dulled slightly. The likely conclusion is that they are too good to go down but a mite short of the requirement for a place in the top seven, but perhaps the chance to show their old manager what he is missing will stoke enough fire to get them going again. NATottenham have a longstanding interest in Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish and made efforts to sign him during the summer. He is good but Spurs would have been better off going for James Maddison, whom Leicester prised from Norwich for £22m. That is much less than Villa demanded for Grealish and is proving to have been a snip. With Caglar Soyuncu showing in recent weeks that he has the tools to become a very accomplished centre-back to partner or lessen the dependency on Harry Maguire, Leicester could seriously trouble Spurs on Saturday. And while Tottenham recruited no one, Leicester have strong claims to have made the signings of the season, with only the captures of Lucas Torreira, David Brooks and Xherdan Shaqiri looking as shrewd as those of Soyuncu and especially Maddison. PDWhile Burnley only lost 2-0 at Crystal Palace last weekend, the scoreline did little justice to the home side’s almost total dominance. Lucky to escape Selhurst Park without being slaughtered, Burnley were much improved against Liverpool, even if the two-goal margin remained. A home game against Brighton is next on the itinerary for Sean Dyche’s side, whose aggression in the tackle so annoyed Jürgen Klopp on Wednesday night despite few or any of the challenges that prompted the Liverpool boss to clutch his pearls having been fouls. With only two wins to their name all season, Burnley need more points on the board and they need them fast. Expect Klopp’s sermonising on their approach to go unheeded as they try to take all three in the kind of game they have to start winning if they are to have any chance of survival.

He rose to fame as a purveyor of honest, bar-band rock, devoid of the ponderous flim-flam, elevated self-importance and glittery excess to which other 70s musicians were partial a trustworthy teller of gritty truths about blue-collar America a true believer in the primal power of rock’n’roll. He’s a very odd fit among the razzle-dazzle of the Great White Way’s other current musical offerings: Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, The Cher Show and Frozen.Or perhaps not. Virtually the first thing you hear on this 150-minute live recording is Springsteen slyly informing his audience that he’s exactly what fans think he’s not: phoney. “I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with just a bit of fraud – so am I … I’ve never held an honest job in my entire life … never worked nine-to-five … I’ve never seen the inside of a factory and yet it’s all I’ve ever written about. Standing before you is a man who has become wildly and absurdly successful writing about something of which he had absolutely no experience. I made it all up.”Should anyone think that Springsteen on Broadway is a stark, purgative exercise in stripping away decades of accumulated mythology, it’s worth noting that Springsteen follows this confession with a description of seeing Elvis on the Ed Sullivan Show. It’s so epic in its mythologising that it brings to mind Nick Cave’s Tupelo, a song that depicts Presley’s birth as an awesome, terrifying supernatural event from the pages of the Old Testament. This contrast sets the tone for the whole enterprise. Springsteen on Broadway is a really charming album – charming enough, in fact, to convince a Boss agnostic that there’s more to the man than they might previously have thought – and its charm rests on Springsteen’s alternating conflicting desires to let light in on what he calls “the magic trick”, and suggest that it might really be magic after all.We learn that Bruce Springsteen is as much a contrived character as Ziggy Stardust – a stadium-filling exaggeration of Springsteen’s troubled factory-worker father – and that we should be wary of treating what he says as gospel: “I’m Mr Born to Run … New Jersey is a death-trap, listen to my lyrics … I currently live 10 minutes from my hometown.” But we also learn that the man behind said character truly believes all the hokey stuff he yells at those packed stadiums about just being a prisoner of rock’n’roll, a belief occasionally expressed in terms so earnest they would make Bono blush: “Bands come in search of lightning and thunder … a communion of souls … true rock’n’roll will never die.” Nor, unlike a lot of performers who have created a character to inhabit on stage, is Springsteen a man much crippled by self-doubt: “Before me, there was no Jersey Shore. Jersey almighty, I fuckin’ invented it.”Its charm is aided by the fact that, while clearly scripted, the between-song monologues – which occasionally last three or four times as long as the song they’re introducing – are filled with striking, writerly imagery: his lengthy description of being sent into his local bar as child to fetch his dad home is a funny, telling short story in itself. If the monologues occasionally overshadow the material they’re meant to support, more often the stripped-back acoustic performances alone cast his songs in fresh light. Denuded of the E Street Band’s post-Phil Spector blare, Thunder Road sounds dark and desperate rather than cathartic. Born in the USA undergoes the most dramatic transformation: it starts out as – of all things – a Within You Without You-esque faux-raga, then turns into desolate a capella blues. Its triumphal original incarnation became perhaps the most widely misunderstood song in rock history. Here, there’s absolutely no doubt what Springsteen was driving at all along. Perhaps understandably, given its history, Born in the USA is preceded by a very lengthy explanation of its genesis. This is one of a handful of moments where, in recorded form at least, you start to wish he’d get on with it. It’s not the only point where Springsteen on Broadway hits the standard problem with live albums as a poor substitute for actually being there. The appearance of his wife and musical collaborator Patti Scialfa was widely reported as an emotional highlight of the Broadway shows. Here, it doesn’t seem that way: her voice sounds beautiful harmonising on Tougher Than the Rest, but some atmospheric impact has clearly been lost in the transition from stage to tape. Most of the time, however, the cocktail of homespun wisdom, frankness and blatant yarn-spinning is genuinely enthralling, a portrait of the rock star as a complex, conflicted 69-year-old man.Confidence Man – Santa’s Comin’ Down the ChimneyA useful corrective to the already nerve-jangling sound of Wonderful Christmastime and Do They Know It’s Christmas blaring out everywhere: a minimal, funky 80s house-inspired bit of festive cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3cb4e778233f103a9812e238e8712f5cafe0ebf/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c744b5d1d6f9e05dc7bef262d3c0ec","title":"james review sse hydro glasgow","story":"SSE Hydro, GlasgowFronted by a prowling, prancing Tim Booth, James conjure mass singalongs and communal spiritMidway through a nearly two-hour set, James singer Tim Booth reveals that the narrow gangway he has been prowling and prancing along was originally supposed to be situated much further into the crowd. Apparently, health and safety intervened. “They were worried you might devour me,” he declares. “But sometimes I don’t mind being devoured.”With eight band members on stage and a back catalogue of 15 albums – including this year’s strident Living in Extraordinary Times – there is currently more James to feast on than ever, and in this case bigger is demonstrably better. The canny decision to team up with fellow indie veterans the Charlatans for a brief UK tour of jumbo-sized venues nudges the night into mini-festival territory, for a seasoned congregation equal parts rowdy and rapt.It is Booth’s swooping, decadent voice that helps sell the abundance of new tracks. Anything he does is inherently dramatic, so it is little wonder the 58-year-old is a sometime actor. With his shaven head and live-wire charisma, Booth could play anything from intense yoga instructor to terrifying Russian heavy. The audience certainly want a piece of his action: after an early runout for their shuffling 1997 hit Waltzing Along, he is pulled into the throng.Rather than try and calm things down, they then play Sit Down, a hit in 1991 and perhaps the first James song to confirm their gift for combining grand rock gestures with emotional communion. It creates a tangible charge that echoes throughout the rest of the set. They reach even deeper into their back catalogue to pull out Stutter, a reminder of the arty, angular James of the 1980s. It is a strident mirror-dimension version of These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ that builds toward drunk-tank guitar squall.That the material from Living in Extraordinary Times holds its own alongside such past glories is never less than impressive.

That would have meant an automatic election before the introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act in 2011, which formalised the rules governing votes of confidence.“If under the current rules we cannot get an election, all options must be on the table,” Corbyn wrote. “Those should include Labour’s alternative and, as our conference decided in September, the option of campaigning for a public vote to break the deadlock.”Labour sources said recent polling showed that the most popular option with the British public was trying to renegotiate the Brexit deal, although the party wants to retain maximum flexibility in what is likely to be a chaotic period if May’s deal is, as is widely expected, voted down.The careful positioning came as it emerged that a head-to-head TV debate between Corbyn and May would almost certainly not take place after ITV announced it had abandoned its plan to broadcast it because Labour and the Tories could not agree on its format. The decision followed the BBC dropping its own plans for a similar programme.However, Labour’s decision to maintain its “constructive ambiguity” over Brexit and support a range of options came under fire from frustrated second-referendum campaigners on Thursday, one of whom abandoned her plan to submit an amendment to next week’s final vote on Thursday.Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, had planned to put down a cross-party “doctor’s amendment” calling for a second referendum, but said she would not do so because she had been persuaded that without Labour frontbench support at this stage it would be at risk of heavy defeat.Wollaston said that she made her decision after discussions with the people’s vote second-referendum campaign, many of whose active members included backbench Labour MPs such as Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. “Labour has to end the constructive ambiguity, Corbyn has to come off the fence,” Wollaston added.She said that she would make her move after May’s deal “failed in the Commons”, although last night the Liberal Democrats took advantage of Wollaston’s decision to submit their own amendment instead.The Lib Dem amendment instructs the government “to take all necessary steps to prepare for a people’s vote” although the party’s small number of MPs in the Commons means it will have no chance of passing it next week.Corbyn said that as part of Labour’s “alternative plan” he wants to strike a “comprehensive customs union with the EU, with a British say in future trade deals”. He added that he wants the UK to enjoy “a new and strong relationship with the single market that gives us frictionless trade” – although with time running out before Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 it was unclear how the plan could be negotiated.Corbyn also came out against the unpopular customs backstop in an effort to woo pro Brexit voters, warning that if the UK used it “workers’ rights would be allowed to fall behind” and “restrictions on state aid to industry would be locked in”.The article came a day after it emerged that the Labour’s powerful union backer, Len McCluskey, had warned Labour MPs in a private meeting that they should have reservations about a second referendum.One person present said that McCluskey had warned that there would be “a sense of betrayal” if the party chose that option, although the issue is isive at senior levels of the party. Over the weekend it emerged that Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, had wanted Labour to quickly get to the point where a second referendum became an option.In September Labour adopted a compromise position in which the party would first decide whether to oppose May’s deal, then, if it was voted down, try to force a general election, before turning to other options. But with the vote looming, Corbyn and the party’s leadership is coming under pressure to spell out what it might do next.Tony Blair, the former prime minister and campaigner for a second referendum, returned to Westminster on Thursday to say he believed that May’s “half in and half out” deal satisfied no one in the Brexit debate and that there was no solution that commanded majority support in the House of Commons either.If May’s deal is defeated in the Commons on Tuesday Corbyn could call for a vote of no confidence on Wednesday. However, Labour is desperate to avoid signalling its intentions until the last minute.Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, if May is defeated by one vote, her government will fall, but there will be 14 days in which an alternative government could be formed.Corbyn flies to Lisbon on Friday for the two-day congress of the Party of European Socialists. Party sources said he was expected to meet Frans Timmermans, a European commission vice-president who is the socialists parties’ candidate for the commission presidency, to press his case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf36bb221bfb0fc21f3b29cf76ffd0db0cfc3ec/0_94_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c930e7f4c9ce9107e6b4f47418bd1873","title":"the end of days draws nigh our maybots gone truly rogue","story":"Cover blown, her masterplan exposed, May is hellbent on ensuring she loses the Commons’ Brexit vote next TuesdayFor a while now, some of us in Westminster have been convinced that Theresa May is a sleeper agent whose mission is to undermine her own government. That conspiracy theory is now officially dead in the water. Because there is now nothing secretive about the prime minister’s actions. Her cover is well and truly blown. She is entirely open about using every opportunity to destroy her credibility.May has gone rogue. A one-woman Terminator whose systems are riddled with malware and who is hellbent on destroying everything around her. The government, the country, the universe. But most of all, herself.It’s long been axiomatic that the prime minister is at her most convincing when she is saying nothing at all. So her best chance of getting her Brexit deal through the Commons was always to hide under the duvet and watch Dynasties on her laptop.But at some point in the last few days, May has appeared to come to the astonishing conclusion that she actually has a hope of winning next Tuesday’s vote. Quite how she has come to that algorithmic impossibility is not clear – circuit overload is the most likely answer – but now the idea is in her head she is doing everything in her power to make sure it doesn’t become reality. Which is why she chose to spend her breakfast time giving a 20-minute interview to Radio 4’s Today programme.Here was the prime minister at her most Maybotic. Staccato, brittle and with a delivery that flatlined. She could not have sounded less enthusiastic about her deal if she had tried. It was a good deal because it was the only deal, she said in a dead monotone.Worried that she might be presenting herself as too coherent, May spent the last 15 minutes failing to give straight answers to straight questions, talking in meaningless soundbites and leaving everyone guessing as to whether she really had a strategy. If there had been anyone in favour of her deal at the start of the interview, there wasn’t by the end.Further evidence of May’s masterplan to undermine the country was on show at Brexit questions in the Commons. In its early days the Brexit department had a sense of national importance. Now it is nothing more than a sideshow, whose primary job is to try to make sure there are enough lorry parks in Kent in case the country grinds to a standstill on 30 March next year.Having already lost two Brexit secretaries in David Davis and Dominic Raab – no great loss, some might say – May has had to rustle up someone else to do the job.It hasn’t been easy. The Four Pot Plants declined to join the cabinet on the grounds that they were hopelessly overqualified. So the prime minister had to cast her net wider. In Stephen Barclay she made an inspired choice. Barclay is a man after her own heart. A man who can spend hours saying nothing meaningful. Though in his case he has little alternative as he doesn’t actually know anything meaningful. He is the nonentity’s nonentity. Brexit questions passed in a gentle haze of futility, while the few dozen MPs in the chamber dozed off. The radioactive isotopes Barclay is tasked with stockpiling have a longer half-life than his department.In the third day of the Brexit debate, Philip Hammond was talking down both the deal and the economy. He was very keen to keep his distance from the withdrawal agreement and future partnership by repeatedly referring to the deal as “the prime minister’s deal”. Nothing to do with me, guv. It was basically all a bit rubbish and everyone was going to be broke, but we’d be a bit less broke with “the prime minister’s” deal. Thanks.There were many interventions. Quite why Nadine Dorries is so keen to parade her ignorance is a mystery – you’d have thought she’d have preferred to leave room for doubt – and Hammond only made half-hearted attempts to defend the deal. The forecasts predicting doom weren’t forecasts. They were modelled scenarios that predicted doom. That sort of thing.Like the rest of the government, Hammond seems more concerned with considering his own future rather than the country’s after the vote is lost next Tuesday.John McDonnell gave a measured and reasoned deconstruction of why the government’s deal was a total mess. He rather glossed over the fact that the Labour leadership had yet to come up with their own plan that didn’t presuppose the EU would give us all the benefits of being in the customs union and single market with none of the obligations.Even so, the shadow chancellor’s contribution was rather more helpful than much of what followed. The nadir was David Davis, who knows even less about the economy than he does about anything else. His main thrust was that he had been absolutely right to do nothing as Brexit secretary because EU negotiations always got done in the last 10 seconds, and that Canada +++ was called Canada +++ because it delivered Canada – – – . Truly we are reaching the end of days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e909d8da276dcaa25baca97b134d6d63e8664e75/0_36_6025_3615/master/6025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d04b42c53a680540b4376e4d4a104bc","title":"young british black men change their names to increase chances of being hired","story":"A Hackney youth project aims to help overqualified but underemployed young people find their placeIn youth centres in cities across the UK young people are going into studios and remixing music. But at the Moving on Up project at Hackney Council for Voluntary Service (HCVS), young men searching for a job are remixing their names.Oluwatosin Adegoke, 23, who graduated this year from Bristol University, was an early adopter of this strategy. He’s been called Peter, the last of his four middle names, since he was a child.“I think my African parents want it to be easier for me in school,” he says. “But in the past two to three years I’ve had to start thinking about it a bit more. One, it’s instinct and two, whenever I go by Oluwatosin I have to spell it, and sometimes I get referred to as Oliver – even after I spell it out.”At Moving on Up, which the  visited as part of its Bias in Britain series, they aim to do something about that. “The difference is getting a foot in the door,” says Deji Adeoshun, a youth worker at HCVS, who advises Adegoke and others who take part. “I’ve had some guys who have had to change their surname because that was an issue,” he says, describing one in particular who was applying for an IT job. “Same job – applied with his actual surname and didn’t get a call back, applied with a Christian name and got an interview.”The strategy Adeoshun advocates might seem radical to some, but in the context of a workplace culture that often leaves black men excluded, radical action can be necessary. Such prejudices have clear economic consequences. The poverty rate for ethnic minorities is double that of white groups, according to research last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also noted that workers who were not white were concentrated in low-paid sectors. And that was despite generally higher standards of academic attainment than most white groups.It is young black men who suffer the brunt of the exclusion, in particular thanks to specific stereotypes around aggression and fecklessness. “Aggression and violence is the strongest stereotype that research has shown is associated with black men,” Kandola says.Connor Robinson, mixed race, from south Croydon, is taller and bigger than your average 18-year-old. Robinson has been working with Talent Match Croydon, a local project set up to help disadvantaged young people into work.“Being brown or being black has been a big effect on my life,” says Robinson. “I think white people are very stereotyping towards me because I’m brown, because they think I’m a rudeboy or gangster. White people are very quick to judge black and brown people.”While many black and brown people learn to ignore, or become inured to, such casual racism, for Connor, who is autistic, the experiences continue to trouble him. Racism, he says, means he is socially isolated from a community which he strongly identifies with through his white mother.Most confrontational racism went out with the Equalities Acts, hate crimes legislation and black and white TV. But as Adeoshun, the youth worker, points out, these days, and particularly in the workplace: “Racism is not overt, it’s subtle.”While discrimination comes top of a list of barriers that face young black jobseekers, it is commonly expressed through other, related, hurdles. One is a lack of self-confidence in an alien environment entirely the preserve of white people.Another problem is a lack of role models and social networks to help people into industries. Lamide Olusegun, 23, one of the young men visiting Hackney CVS, who this year received a higher education diploma in animation from the University of the Creative Arts, had hoped for work in a production company. It was not that the doors were shut to him, more that he could not find any doors at all.“I felt like it’s who you know, it’s not really what’s in your portfolios. Especially in this art field. A lot of jobs are gotten in the bars and it’s just connections,” he says. As a black animator, he feels he has no one to look up to. “I’ve not seen personally any other black animators. Even at uni on my course, I don’t think there was that many black people, maybe just a handful – or even Asians as well, just ethnic people.”Such barriers mean that by the time young black men find their way into work they have been forced to severely moderate their ambitions. So, they – and particularly the subgroup of black African workers – are more likely to be overqualified for their roles. Adeoshun, a law graduate, is a prime example. He passed his bar exams only to find he was unable to secure a pupillage at a chambers.And for those who appear stuck on the scrapheap, the lure of the shadow economy is strong. One young man in Croydon speaks of how, in an effort to raise a couple of hundred pounds, he pulled a scam and was convicted of fraud. Now he is blocked from any job in a bank, further limiting his prospects.What are the solutions? Many companies, including the , have begun rolling out “unconscious bias” training for senior managers, in an effort to make people aware of any unexamined prejudices that could lead to their not hiring people from ethnic minority groups.But in a key report on race in the workplace, commissioned by the government and published in February last year, the Conservative peer Ruby McGregor-Smith said this unconscious bias was often anything but. “We need to stop hiding behind the mantle of ‘unconscious bias’,” she declared.Lady McGregor-Smith said: “I have to question how much of this bias is truly ‘unconscious’ and by terming it ‘unconscious’ how much it allows us to hide behind it. Conscious or unconscious, the end result of bias is racial discrimination, which we cannot and should not accept.”Kandola, the business psychologist, warns that such a stance risks undermining attempts to eliminate what is a most insidious form of racism. “Not all biases are conscious,” he says. “There are some things that are very blatant that occur in the workplace and they are clearly not unconscious. But there are other things which are far more subtle that happen and people may not be aware they are doing it.He recommends seeing racial bias as a performance issue at work, feeding back to managers about their biases and telling them how to change them, and disciplining those who fail to respond.But young black men are not sitting back and waiting for procedures to be put in place and for attitudes to change. Olusegun is among those being active. Instead of trying to find work with an established production company he has taken his future into his own hands by starting his own business, merchandising his cartoon characters for sale online and in the market.“I’ve seen the light in self-employment, it’s helped me build some resilience as well,” he says. “I’ve learned so much of how to run a business, how to brand yourself, how to market yourself. These are things that I had a little idea about, but I’d never had a chance to practice it. And I’m seeing results as well, so it’s not looking bleak for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f6919bdd8998c5935fc7a603dfb89266fb1f97/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9141e4e6bc355358eec4d40dc48306","title":"motability firm boss to get 22m bonus on top of 17m salary","story":"Report reveals ‘generous’ remuneration of Mike Betts, who runs organisation that receives £888m of tax breaksThe boss of the business that leases cars to people with disabilities on behalf of the Motability charity is to receive a £2.2m bonus on top of his controversial seven-figure salary, the government spending watchdog has revealed.Mike Betts, chief executive of Motability Operations, came under fire earlier this year after MPs called his annual £1.7m pay package “totally unacceptable”.A National Audit Office report published on Friday says as well as his “generous” remuneration, Betts is also in line for a previously undisclosed performance bonus worth about £2.2m.The Motability scheme enables disabled people to lease adapted cars by using by their enhanced mobility disability benefits – either disability living allowance or its successor, the personal independence payment. It currently helps about 614,000 people, many of whom would otherwise struggle to afford a vehicle.The NAO is critical of the performance plan put in place for Betts and his fellow directors in 2008, saying that the targets meant to incentivise “excellent performance” were set at levels below what the company was achieving when the scheme was introduced.The targets were “easily exceeded” and in the first seven years of the plan, five executive directors received “generous” remuneration of £15.3m in total, a near fourfold increase for what the NAO suggests was unexceptional performance.“Motability Operations’ management has performed well since 2002. However, we do think there is a difference between turning an underperforming business around and carrying out a series of important but not necessarily exceptional tasks to keep it on a road to a successful operation,” it concludes.Although the 2008 scheme ended in 2015 and a new scheme will cut directors’ remuneration – Betts’ package is likely to shrink from £1.7m to £1.4m in 2019-20 – the NAO says it will still be substantially more generous than those for comparable public sector organisations that compete with the private sector for executive talent, such as BBC Studios and Network Rail.Although Motability does not directly receive public funding, critics point out that it receives about half of its annual £4bn income from disability benefits redirected to it by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on behalf of claimants. It also receives £888m worth of tax breaks that no other firm is entitled to, and is in effect a monopoly.While the company has performed well and deserves credit for providing an excellent service to customers, it has operated in a protected environment, the NAO says. It has made £1bn in unplanned profit since 2008 and holds nearly £2.6bn in reserves, significantly higher than other major car-leasing companies.The scheme is overseen by a charity, Motability, and operated under a seven-year rolling contract by Motability Operations, which is a public limited company. The NAO found that the charity has little formal influence over Motability Operations’ executive pay arrangements.The NAO notes that the company has donated £345m to the Motability charity since 2010. In September it announced a further £400m donation, an amount equivalent to 14 times the charity’s annual spending in 2017-18. It was not yet clear that Motability could absorb the scale of the donations it has received or spend them effectively.Responding to the NAO report, the Motability charity said it would “seek improved mechanisms to better influence Motability Operations’ executive remuneration”. Its chair, Lord Sterling, said that the scheme accepted the watchdog’s recommendations but insisted there were “areas still open to further debate”.A DWP spokeswoman said: “To ensure that the scheme is focused on delivering better value for money we are committed to working with the charity and key stakeholders so that current and future arrangements result in improved outcomes for disabled people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e62ae29597794825057c117b808285e6b6fd327/16_732_2926_1756/master/2926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184eb1aa71b62f53f132b0ce67da84a1","title":"sharp rise in number of young people seeking help for anxiety childline","story":"Majority of Childline sessions provided to girls with helpline’s founder saying system is ‘failing them’A children’s helpline says the number of counselling sessions it has delivered to youngsters with anxiety has almost doubled in two years, with nine out of 10 calls from girls.According to Childline, which is supported by the NSPCC children’s charity, there has been a sharp rise in the number of young people seeking help because of anxiety as they struggle to cope with the demands of modern life.Callers gave a variety of reasons for their anxiety including bullying and cyber-bullying, eating problems, relationship issues and school pressures such as homework and exams. Others reported abuse, neglect and bereavement.The NSPCC said the figures demonstrated the increasingly important role Childline was playing in the child mental health landscape. Young people who were referred to children and adolescent mental health services could face long delays and government proposals to boost support in schools were being rolled out gradually.The charity also reiterated now familiar concerns about girls’ mental health. According to the latest figures from Childline, about 17,400 counselling sessions were delivered to girls suffering from anxiety, and 2,300 to boys. In a further 1,600 cases gender was undocumented.Childline’s founder, Esther Rantzen, said: “I am increasingly concerned at the huge rise in anxiety affecting our young people. It seems that the support they desperately need from family, friends, their schools or mental health professionals is either not there when they need it, or is failing them.”Peter Wanless, NSPCC’s chief executive, added: “Anxiety can be a crippling illness and it is deeply worrying that the number of counselling sessions we are delivering for this issue is rising so quickly.“Increasingly Childline is filling the gap left by our public mental health services, providing young people with a place they can go for round-the-clock help and advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5a6edfba170212553a660cfd538310f4cbfa23/0_133_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=543a226d6f9859b97f0e9e4108856dbd","title":"surfing skateboarding olympics tokyo 2020","story":"• Softball and goalball are others to gain from ‘aspirational fund’• Mims Davies lauds chance for athletes to shine at Tokyo 2020Britain’s surfers, skateboarders and softball players are to receive official funding for the first time to help them qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

It was hailed by the new sports minister, Mims Davies, who said it would allow more athletes to compete at the very top in Tokyo.“It will help Great Britain and Northern Ireland continue to be a leading Olympic and Paralympic nation and I am sure the athletes that will benefit will inspire the nation and help their sports grow,” she said.Eight other sports are also getting a helping hand as part of the government’s £3m investment in the aspirational fund, including wheelchair rugby (£500,000) and badminton (£259,679), which were both controversially stripped of funding after the Rio 2016 Games. In addition the Paralympic sport of goalball will receive investment.Funding will also go to the Olympic sports of archery, beach volleyball, fencing, artistic swimming and table tennis.Alongside their qualification plan, sports seeking funding were asked to submit details of how they will capitalise on the impact of competing at the Games and engage and inspire future generations.Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, said: “This new aspiration fund is a fantastic opportunity for these athletes and sports to get on track for the Tokyo Games.“Many of the sports we are currently unable to support, whilst further away from reaching the podium, have the potential not only to inspire through their performances on the field of play but also to inspire new audiences to engage in sport and activity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a613dab69e801a084f69b053a258ffb27bd3a8/0_101_2504_1502/master/2504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38bfcb14faba035b07db1084fcc6e5a","title":"sports advertising ban horse racing","story":"It is not often that bookmakers give in to pressure from anti-gambling groups without being forced to, so Thursday’s news that the biggest names in online betting will soon introduce a whistle-to-whistle ban on television advertising around sporting events is a collector’s item. Ray Winstone’s loss, many will feel, is the armchair fan’s gain.The market leaders in online gambling, including Bet365, SkyBet and Paddy Power Betfair, are all signed up to the voluntary ban, from which TV coverage of horse racing will be exempt. So, too, are the firms with big retail estates, such as Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill, who may – perhaps – have learned a lesson from their long, bitter and ultimately futile campaign to resist pressure for a cut in stakes on fixed‑odds betting terminals.The agreement announced on Thursday in effect implements a proposal that was expected to feature in the next Labour manifesto, and does so, in all likelihood, at least three and a half years in advance of any legal requirement to do so.So, has the UK’s gambling industry suddenly decided that its opponents were right all along? Of course not. Their decision will have been taken after careful consideration of its long-term effect on profitability, versus the possible impact of even stricter regulation further down the line. The clear concern seems to be that, if they do not do something themselves, the alternative could be much, much worse.It is a calculated move, not a climbdown. And when it comes to football, which dominates the online market, it is also far from complete as it does not cover shirt sponsorships, for instance.But again this could have knock-on benefits for some British firms at least, since the overwhelming majority of betting‑related shirt sponsors are Asian firms with no significant customer base in the UK. If there are no gambling ads in the breaks, the Premier League could feel that the time is right to ban shirt sponsorships for gambling businesses, too – which would be no bad thing for high-profile UK-based bookies that operate in the Asian market.It is also significant that the bookies’ self-imposed ban covers the entirety of any sporting event bar racing that starts before 9pm, so there will be no blitz of ads post‑watershed. This means racing will soon find itself in the happy position of being the only sport around which the biggest names in betting are able to advertise, which could prove a significant boost for the only sport that has been intertwined with betting from its earliest days.The law of supply and demand suggests the value of the advertising opportunities around the sport can go only one way. As a result the value of racing’s media rights, for instance, should also increase and the terrestrial rights in particular could be a very interesting proposition for a number of bidders when ITV’s contract expires at the end of 2020.As things stand, and assuming the bookies’ agreement holds, racing could offer not just the best but the only significant space on mainstream TV to advertise betting brands around sport.The bookies’ greatest fear, of course, is racing’s nightmare, too. What if a future government decides that even stricter regulation is required and introduces a blanket ban on gambling advertising? Nothing seems impossible in politics these days but Labour’s proposal included an exemption for racing and the industry is such an important employer that it is difficult to see either major party going that far.The days when racing accounted for the overwhelming majority of the bookies’ turnover are long gone but the sport remains, in many respects, the best and most compelling of all betting mediums.Any move that increases racing’s significance for the bookies can work only in the sport’s favour, because, like it or not – and there are still plenty who try to pretend otherwise – betting will always be vital for racing’s popularity and prosperity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99167da0d0f1f25430ac4898fd2dbd83d4d578af/0_141_3885_2330/master/3885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b886c9e50afe62b25cb871d74dcf40e9","title":"australia v india first test day two live","story":"In my simple brain, I am finding it impossible to say Bumrah without thinking of Mumm-Ra, the arch enemy of the Thundercats. Is it just me?60th over: Australia 121-5 (Head 19, Paine 1) Bumrah continues to bowl full and straight at Paine, finding some menace with one that holds its line from that angle wide of the crease. This is Ntini-like from the Indian quick. The danger with that line of course is it doesn’t require much of an error in line to leak onto a right-hander’s pads and that’s exactly what Bumrah does to allow Paine to get off the mark. 59th over: Australia 120-5 (Head 19, Paine 0) Head, Paine is Australia’s partnership at the crease and also the home side’s state of mind following that excellent Bumrah over. Head ensures wickets do not follow in consecutive overs, repelling Shami comfortably. 58th over: Australia 120-5 (Head 19, Paine 0) That wicket has upped the intensity in the field, Bumrah immediately hard at Paine and the close fielders audible. The length to Paine is full and he just about connects with a forward defence trapped on the crease, then he aims a drive that misses on the inside edge, drawing a massive appeal behind the wicket that is declined by Dharamasena. Big passage of play coming up for Australia’s skipper with India’s tails up. Bumrah begins the over by rapping Handscomb on his pads but the angle from well wide of the crease means umpire Dharmasena isn’t interested in the appeal for LBW. The next delivery is on off stump and Handscomb defends from the crease. The next one is wider and - eurgh - Handscomb attempts a late cut and glances the ball straight into Pant’s gloves. That was a peculiar shot considering all the effort Handscomb had made to dig in. It wasn’t short or wide enough for that type of shot, especially with Bumrah coming in on such a sharp angle from wide of the crease. Australia up against it again.57th over: Australia 120-4 (Handscomb 34, Head 19) Mohammed Shami is Bumrah’s partner after Tea from the Cathedral End. He’s on a nice line and length, initially drawing Handscomb forward and almost inducing an uppish drive through the covers. The Victorian readjusts nicely, waiting in his crease to dab the next delivery behind point, rotating the strike. This session is scheduled to witness a total of 32 overs, which means unlike yesterday we should see the full complement of 90 sent down.56th over: Australia 118-4 (Handscomb 33, Head 18) Jasprit Bumrah opens the bowling after Tea, ending Ravichandran Ashwin’s marathon spell. He’s onto a nagging length from around the wicket to Travis Head but eventually strays onto the left-hander’s pads allowing him to rotate the strike. Bumrah is on the same length to Handscomb who defends watchfully from the crease. The players are back out after that short interval, play will resume shortly. Thank you very much Geoff. I am enjoying the impromptu game of Rumpelstiltskin. I look forward to the P guesses by day five in Sydney.Time for me to settle in and steer you to the end of what has been another absorbing day of Test cricket. I will be on deck for the next couple of hours, anchoring this second day of the series to its conclusion. Please keep me company, either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft - or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@the.Enough from me – it’s time to hand over to Jonathan Paisley Howcroft for the run home. Thanks for your company.On the Shaun Marsh question, some people would argue that it’s unfair to pile into him on the basis of one score at the start of the series. That’s true, he could easily make runs in the second innings, or the second Test. But it is worth noting how little he’s contributed since his senior teammates were suspended. And the overall trends of his career.As of today, he now has 26 Test dismissals in single figures out of 60. That’s a rate of 43.33 percent, where most good batsmen are more like 20 to 25 percent. That second innings needs to be a good one.That’s the break: Australia added only 60 runs in a hard-fought session, and more importantly lost two wickets. Their two biggest wickets, in Shaun Marsh and Usman Khawaja, the only batsmen in the side with multiple Test hundreds. Khawaja was done in by some good bowling that he couldn’t do too much about. Marsh was rather more culpable for the nature of his shot. The current pair have a big job to do, needing to eat into that 133 deficit as far as possible and then look to give Australia a lead. Which they’ll need batting last on this surface, which is spinning already.55th over: Australia 117-4 (Handscomb 33, Head 17) The clock ticks past 3:40pm local time after only a couple of balls. Third of the over, Shami has Head attempting a glance and missing down the leg side. There’s an appeal that’s not all that convincing. But Kohli goes upstairs. It didn’t seem to be Shami pushing for that appeal. The review shows that it missed the bat and probably flicked Head’s clothing. Not out and a review offered up to the review gods.Head works three runs square, then Handscomb is nearly out again, forcing at Shami off the back foot and nearly edging. Hands on heads in the Indian cordon. If you run your fingers through your hair in frustration, I suppose that’s a hands-comb?As for Allan – alright, I’ll take it. I promise it had nothing to do with Peter Siddle.54th over: Australia 113-4 (Handscomb 32, Head 15) The tea break is looming, and Head happily prods out a maiden from Ashwin.53rd over: Australia 113-4 (Handscomb 32, Head 15) Finally Handscomb’s positioning deep in the crease pays off. When Shami starts a new spell with a half-tracker, and Handscomb can swat the pull shot for four. He’s into the 30s. Glides a single later in the over. Head pulls a ball awkwardly, lobbed in the air towards leg slip, but lands it safely for a run. Was that just off the pad? Probably.52nd over: Australia 106-4 (Handscomb 27, Head 14) Ashwin getting good bounce still, hits Handscomb with some kick from the pitch as the batsman advances yet again. Eventually finds a run on the drive from the fifth ball.51st over: Australia 106-4 (Handscomb 26, Head 14) Ishant to Handscomb, the bowler is attacking the pads a lot more now, angling in and hoping to get through. Handscomb plays consistently to the on side, but only a couple of singles result from the over.50th over: Australia 104-4 (Handscomb 25, Head 13) Handscomb coming down to defend, has to suddenly jam down on an Ashwin ball, stopping it from sneaking through to stump him – the batsman had to drop his knees and try to smoosh the ball with a startled action, like a surprised chef trying to flatten a darting mouse with a spatula. It doesn’t stop Handscomb employing the dance next time. Eventually he gets off strike with a single through midwicket, but Head hands it right back again. All yours champ.49th over: Australia 102-4 (Handscomb 24, Head 12) Head is starting to get off strike easily now, looking the more in control. Handscomb has a booming Finch drive at Ishant which both nearly nicks his bat and takes his off stump. So it’s not like any Australian batsman so far today has covered himself with glory, but...48th over: Australia 100-4 (Handscomb 23, Head 11) The hundred comes up as Head works a single. Ashwin then bombs the ball in at Handscomb’s pads, drawing a couple of false shots and one appeal at bat-pad. Is there some rough starting to create problems there? That makes it interesting for Handscomb, so positive against spin.47th over: Australia 99-4 (Handscomb 23, Head 10) Handscomb is batting so deep, with his backlift so high, that Ishant Sharma is very happy to pitch full to him. Test him out and make him take risks. Ed Cowan on the radio reckons that the high backlift makes it harder to get power in your drives, and certainly Handscomb’s versions of the shot that over are jammed out to mid-off or mid-on rather than driven fluidly away. It’s a maiden for Ishant as the seamers rotate.46th over: Australia 99-4 (Handscomb 23, Head 10) Head is getting a bit of footwork going against Ashwin, coming down to drive a single. Handscomb is coming down almost every ball.45th over: Australia 97-4 (Handscomb 22, Head 9) Head versus Bumrah, clips a couple of runs, edges a single. For Victoria at the MCG, Glenn Maxwell just reached 50, then had his batting partner whack a return catch to the bowler, who dropped it and accidentally ran the non-striker out. Maxwell must have killed a black cat with a ladder a couple of years ago. 44th over: Australia 94-4 (Handscomb 22, Head 6) Of course, Handscomb ruins that immediately because he’s so comfortable against Ashwin that he tucks the first ball away for a single. It doesn’t work in India’s favour in the shortest term, as Ashwin bowls one too short and Head is able to cut it away for four. A bit close to his body, maybe a touch of risk, but he hit it cleanly. Then nudges to mid-on for a single to keep the strike.43rd over: Australia 88-4 (Handscomb 21, Head 1) Bumrah to head, who looks more comfortable facing out a maiden from the fast bowler. Perhaps Australia should maintain these positions for now, letting Handscomb handle Ashwin.42nd over: Australia 88-4 (Handscomb 21, Head 1) Head keeps getting on the front foot to Ashwin. Ed Cowan on the radio is saying that, as a fellow left-hander, he should be on the back foot where possible, looking to knock the ball on the head once it has turned or hasn’t. Head looks a bit shaky on a couple of those defensive shots. Survives though, cuts the last ball for a single, and that will be drinks.41st over: Australia 87-4 (Handscomb 21, Head 0) A bowling change, Bumrah for Shami, coming in with his little shuffling run and his giant catapult whaannnggg of an arm swing. Handscomb blocks most of the over but gets beaten by one good one. Seems a bit of a theme.Speaking of, it looks like our theme for the day is Mean Marsh Tweets. I can’t control this, they’re the only thing coming up in the timeline.40th over: Australia 87-4 (Handscomb 21, Head 0) Another left-hander arrives for Ashwin to target, in the form of Travis Head. The batsman leaves a couple of balls that are not far from the stumps, and Ashwin finishes his 15th over with 3-25.That’s huge! Brilliant bowling from Ashwin, who has been so significant today. That ball ripped and leapt at the left-handed Khawaja. It beat the edge of his blade as he pushed forward at it, but had enough bounce to flick the thumb of his glove as it went through to the keeper. Umpire Dharmasena said not out, but the Indians reviewed and were vindicated by Hot Spot and a tiny white mark. Khawaja faced 125 balls for his 28. He was doing his best to match Pujara’s effort from yesterday, but couldn’t get the second half together. And now Khawaja, like Pujara, is going up the stairs. 39th over: Australia 85-3 (Khawaja 27, Handscomb 20) Gee, Shami is swarming Handscomb here. Sure, the batsman got a couple of boundaries away but he doesn’t look convincing. In this over alone, he chops past his stumps, has a ball zing past his edge from back of a length, surprising him with bounce, and then gets beaten on his inside edge and hit just above the pad. Too high for the appeal to be given, but still a win for the bowler. Another maiden.38th over: Australia 85-3 (Khawaja 27, Handscomb 20) Ashwin is proving a handful even on this second day. He nearly sneaks one throw Khawaja, a bit like he did for Harris. Then he draws another edge into the off side. It’s a maiden.36th over: Australia 73-3 (Khawaja 27, Handscomb 8) Just a couple of singles from the Ashwin over.37th over: Australia 85-3 (Khawaja 27, Handscomb 20) “It seems like a mountain to get to 250,” says Allan Border on ABC Radio. Australia’s batting frailties were always the question when India made their partial recovery yesterday. But still a big chance for this pair to make a statement. Handscomb starts with more of an involuntary yelp, as he pulls instinctively at Shami’s bouncer and edges it just over the keeper for four. The next ball he’s more eloquent, if a little vernacular, as he leans back in his camp-back stance and carves away with an open blade behind point for four more. That was more square drive than cut, more Caribbean than South Terrace. Shami follows up by decking a ball away beautifully, ghosting past the outside edge. Then squares him up again. Handscomb responds by flicking another boundary off his pads for four! His waspish backlift came pinging down through that ball. A dozen from the over.35th over: Australia 71-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 7) The Shami cloth is back to give the innings a bit of a polish. Draws an edge from Handscomb but it stays low and bounces before hitting the cordon gap for four. Three slips in for Handscomb, who lashes the cover drive next ball but straight at the field. He’s still hanging back on his stumps a fair way, if you’re on Technique Watch, but he’s getting forward to play the ball more firmly, greeting it on the front foot more often than not. And seems to be starting a bit further outside leg, so he’s able to move across to the ball more decisively? Just at a glance. Chris Rogers has been doing a lot of remedial time with him, and says that now the hips are in better position to do their best work. If there’s anyone who’d know about that, it’s Rogers.34th over: Australia 67-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 3) Ashwin to Khawaja, who swells his Cowan tally by six without scoring a run. Played at almost everything but found the field each time.33rd over: Australia 67-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 3) Peter Handscomb faces out the full over from Ishant, watchfully defending until the last ball, when he on-drives a couple. Meanwhile, on The Internet, one former cricket scribe is lighting up one current Australian player. That second post is an ouch-grenade.32nd over: Australia 65-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 1) Ashwin is in the game now, but Handscomb plays spin well. That’s a good positive over from the batsman, who twice comes down the wicket to defend, and a couple of times goes back, depending on the length. Eventually his positive footwork allows him to flick a run square and get off the mark.31st over: Australia 64-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 0) A maiden from Ishant, as Khawaja soaks up the lot. He’s happy to be a sponge lately, the aberration of that cover drive aside. Here’s the Cowan (the facing of 100 balls, ideally at a strike rate under 30).30th over: Australia 64-3 (Khawaja 26, Handscomb 0) Edged by Khawaja! It’s Ravi Ashwin again, the assassin bowling in his wraparound shades, who gets some turn. Khawaja aims a big cover drive only two balls after Marsh perished the same way. Edges it just past the outstretched hand of slip, and so the current left-hander survives and scores two runs, where Marsh perished.Thoughts on the Marsh wicket: confirmed.29th over: Australia 61-3 (Khawaja 23, Handscomb 0) Ishant only gets a couple of balls at Handscomb in this over. The return player will be super nervous, surely, having to prove himself after being dropped after this corresponding Test last summer. Ishant bowls a no-ball, which he’s a big fan of doing, and Khawaja takes a single. That’s it.28th over: Australia 59-3 (Khawaja 22) Last ball of the over, the wicket falls. A real bonus one for India. Handscomb will be in next, his comeback innings. Head next, who’s never played in Australia. The pressure on Khawaja doubles.What did we say about senior players? Gone, first over after lunch! Ashwin bowls a pretty ordinary delivery, way outside the off stump. There wasn’t a plan for that one. But Marsh sees the width, hurls a huge cover drive at it, and was perhaps throwing his hands too hard. Went at it with a bat that was closer to the horizontal than the diagonal, and so chopped it hard off the bottom edge and back into his stumps. Can someone make an hour-long audio loop of the sound when Finch’s stumps were detonated? What a noise. Maybe throw in the bat noises from the Kohli net session as well. Adam wrote about that the other day.Thanks Adam. What a lovely balanced session of Test cricket. India’s fast bowlers didn’t quite get it right with their accuracy, but Ashwin struck to bring his team back into the game and perhaps bring himself into the series. An early wicket can’t hurt his chances, any rate, even if Australia is an absolute boneyard for touring off-spinners. And most home off-spinners if we’re honest. Anyone who thinks Nathan Lyon’s average or strike rate at home are modest, have a look at the other purveyors of his art over the years. That wicket leaves Australia’s senior players at the crease: Khawaja and Shaun Marsh are the two who’ll have to do the lifting out of this line-up. The responsibility is theirs. They’ll be back after a sandwich.If you have any thoughts you want to share with me over the break, whether of high intellect or otherwise, fire them through on the tweets or the email.27th over: Australia 57-2 (Khawaja 21, Marsh 1) Ishant is back to bowl a one-over spell before lunch. It’s not a good one with Marsh getting a leg bye off the hip then four more from a misdirected ball down the legside that clipped his pad on the way to the rope. With Khawaja flicking two off his blade to finish, he ends the session in the 20s “I think Virat Kohli has missed a trick here,” observes Simon Katich of the shift. “Bumrah was bowling well with rhythm.” LUNCH! That’s my cue to hand the OBO baton to Geoff Lemon for the middle session. Enjoy the afternoon and I’ll catch you tomorrow. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye for now! 26th over: Australia 48-2 (Khawaja 18, Marsh 1) Ashwin races through an over in 60 seconds in order to make sure that India will get one more in before lunch. I always wonder about the logic of this. By sprinting back to his mark, does it reduce his chance of maximising pressure of his own? The main action was from the final ball, Khawaja driving to cover but in the air, falling just short of the man stationed there. Phew. 25th over: Australia 47-2 (Khawaja 18, Marsh 1) Make that four maidens in a row from Bumrah to Khawaja at the northern end. He’s in the zone: nothing is going to stop him eating a sandwich as a not out man.24th over: Australia 47-2 (Khawaja 18, Marsh 1) Ashwin has dismissed Shaun Marsh four times in Tests, Samson says. He’s off the mark first ball of his new over here though, tucking behind square. Khawaja takes on Ishant at point later in the set, making his ground at the danger end even if the throw was on target. Khawaja’s first run for about half an hour or so.23rd over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 17, Marsh 0) Three maidens on the trot from Bumrah to Khawaja since coming back into the attack. Good news for India though, Shami is back on the field so hopefully he will be back into the attack as well after lunch, scheduled ten minutes from now. 22nd over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 17, Marsh 0) India will know how vulnerable Shaun Marsh is early in an innings, falling a disproportionate number of times before reaching double figures. But he starts competently here, defending the rest of the successful Ashwin over. Ashwin wins the battle! His straighter one from around the wicket finds Harris’ inside edge before bouncing up off his front pad, Vijay doing the rest at silly point. A good start from the new opener but he’ll be furious falling close to the bat after doing the hard work against Ashwin.21st over: Australia 45-1 (Harris 26, Khawaja 17) Bumrah to Khawaja, rinse and repeat. I reckon the Australian is settling in for a Leo Sayer. 20th over: Australia 45-1 (Harris 26, Khawaja 17) Harris goes at Ashwin again! “This is really good Test batting,” says Simon Katich on SEN. This time, he splits the gap at cover for another boundary. 19th over: Australia 41-1 (Harris 22, Khawaja 17) Right then, Shami is out of the attack after four very good overs. We can only assume it is related to this arm complaint, which he has gone off the ground to have looked at. Back on to replace him, Bumrah sends down a maiden to Khawaja who is in no hurry this morning, his 17 coming from 62 balls. 18th over: Australia 41-1 (Harris 22, Khawaja 17) Shot! Harris has jumped at Ashwin once an over so far but this is the first time he’s made solid contact, lofting a drive over his head and down to the rope beneath us here at the southern end. Into the 20s he goes. Granted, earlier in the over he wasn’t far away from giving a catch to Vijay at silly point but his hands were just soft enough to prevent the ball going the full journey.

Don’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with the Jimmys. And the Davids, and the other Jimmys,” she said, referring to the Jameses Cordon, Fallon and Kimmel, and David Letterman.“Good guys, great guys some of my best friends are Jimmy. But the last thing I need right now, in this moment in history, is having to listen to men monologue about misogyny, and how other men should just stop being creepy … Rejecting the humanity of a woman is not creepiness. It is misogyny.”She said the Jimmys tended to split “bad men” into two groups: “The WeinsteinBill Cosby types who are so utterly horrible that they might as well be different species to the Jimmys. And then there are the FoJs: the Friends of Jimmy.“These are apparently good men who simply misread the rules – garden-variety consent dyslexics. They have the rulebook but they just skimmed it. ‘Oh, that’s a semi-colon? My bad, I thought it meant anal.’”Gadsby, who on Wednesday won an Australian Aacta award for her Netflix sensation Nanette, said when men who perceived themselves as “good” were able to draw a line between “good” and “bad”, they were then able to move it.“Men will draw a different line for every occasion,” she said. “They have a line for the locker room a line for when their wives, mothers, daughters and sisters are watching another line for when they’re drunk and fratting another line for nondisclosure a line for friends and a line for foes.”The result, she said, was “a world full of ‘good’ men who do very bad things and still believe in their heart of hearts that they are good men because they have not crossed the line, because they move the line for their own good.“Women should be in control of that line, no question.”The Los Angeles galacelebrated the publication of the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Women in Entertainment: Power 100 issue. Monica Lewinsky, Kesha and Lupita Nyong’o also spoke at the event, which honoured the Crazy Rich Asians producer Nina Jacobson and the actor and producer Viola Davis, the magazine’s cover star.The issue was guest edited by Lena Dunham, who wrote an open letter apologising again for initially  defending the Girls writer Murray Miller last year after the actor Aurora Perrineau accused him of sexual assault.“I made a terrible mistake,” she wrote. “I did something inexcusable … There are few acts I could ever regret more in this life.”She continued: “It’s painful to realize that, while I thought I was self-aware, I had actually internalized the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what.”Dunham, the  subject of a far-ranging profile in New York Magazine last month, detailed further instances of assault she had suffered at the hands of unnamed men in the industry.“I didn’t want to tell anyone about the 70-year-old Hollywood luminary who was so angry that I rebuffed his kiss that he made me do 30 takes of the word ‘hello’ ... I didn’t want anyone to know about the pseudo boyfriend who tied me up with my special-occasion stockings and forced himself inside me anally,” she wrote. “I didn’t want people to know which male writers and stars had raged at me.”Dunham appeared at the gala on Thursday, sharing a stage with Perrineau’s mother, Brittany Perrineau.“I learned the ways in which my own heart and mind had been colonised by patriarchy and the ways my own ignorance operated, even as a survivor of multiple sexual assaults,” she said.In response, Brittany Perrineau said her and her daughter “feel your love and receive your heartfelt apology”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0558417bb563f66715cff99188d792f795bb4891/0_432_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faec75bf020e46f654e8141a539875c8","title":"can i use predictive text pc app windows 10","story":"Richard likes Swype’s predictive text on his tablet and wants a similar app for a Windows 10 PCIs there an intelligent keyboard app for Windows 10? I use Swype on my tablet, and apart from being faster than keyboard typing, I love the power of its intelligent predictive text. My PC doesn’t have a touch screen, but I feel I would still benefit from the predictive text, as I’m not a touch typer. I looked at Grammarly, and a couple of others, but they’re not really what I’m after. RichardPredictive text programs have been around for a long time, and many are still available. The first one I used was Brown Bag Software’s MindReader, which arrived on a 5.25in floppy disk in the early 1980s. I don’t know if Brown Bag came up with the idea, but its approach is typical.MindReader read what you were typing, guessed what the word might be, and popped up a numbered list of choices. You could then insert a whole word by selecting the one you wanted. If you didn’t want any of them, you just carried on typing.Many predictive text programs use the PC’s function keys to make the selection, though I can’t remember if MindReader did this as well.If you were a fast typist – even the two-fingered type – then programs such as MindReader were more annoying than helpful. However, predictive software was tremendously useful to people who needed assistance for other reasons. Penfriend says its predictive software “benefits users who have dyslexia, visual impairment or physical disabilities, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, stroke, limb deformities and any condition which impairs the ability to write with a keyboard”.Predictive text programs are also useful in schools, because children can select words that they know but aren’t sure how to spell. Programs such as Quillsoft’s WordQ 5 help by voicing words. It’s usually easier to know if a word sounds right than if it looks right.There are lots of commercial programs aimed at schools. These include Penfriend XP and XL, WordQ, ClaroRead and Crick Software’s Clicker. Much less powerful but free examples for general use include TypingAid, Volkmar Kobelt’s VK TypeHelp and the open-source Presage, which was formerly known as Soothsayer. PhraseExpress isn’t cheap, but you can get a freeware version called Text Expander. TypingAid, which is written using AutoHotkey, works at the system level, so it works with most applications.If you take this route, the best program for your purposes could be SumitSoft’s Typing Assistant. Its features include word prediction, auto-complete, auto-correct and, for abbreviations, auto-expand. It has a Skilled Typist Mode for translators, secretaries, authors, programmers and so on and an Unskilled Typist Mode for people who have problems spelling (including in 50+ foreign languages) or physical disabilities. It costs $129.95 but there’s a 30-day money back guarantee. FastKeys is a cheaper alternative – see below.There’s also Texthelp’s Read\u0026ampWrite, which costs £150 a year and has more than 10 million users, thanks to its corporate and education versions. You’re unlikely to buy Read\u0026ampWrite, but there’s a Google Chrome extension that you can try free for 30 days.When smartphones arrived, predictive text was still a great time-saver. And with the moves from PC keyboards to Blackberry-style phone keyboards to on-screen touch keyboards, we finally got programs such as IBM’s ShapeWriter, Swype, SwiftKey and Google’s Gboard.The bad news is that, as you probably know, Swype has been discontinued. (Nuance bought the company from Cliff Kushler.) The good news is that many people preferred SwiftKey, and that SwiftKey is now being added to Windows 10. (In this case, Microsoft bought the company, despite Microsoft Research coming up with its own Word Flow keyboard.)In Windows 10 (October 2018 Update), go to the Settings cogwheel, select Devices and then Typing. Click on “Suggestions and autocorrections” and turn SwiftKey on for the languages you type in. The initial version should be much enhanced in future updates.It’s not going to be much use to you if you don’t have a touchscreen to work on, but a large proportion of Windows 10 laptops now have touchscreens.This is the age of “big data”, and it’s changing software. In the old days, you needed clever programming to do things like speech recognition and predictive text. Now you can deliver effective results with simple algorithms if you have enough data for pattern matching. Google has frighteningly large amounts of data, and it is using it to good effect.A couple of years ago I stopped using smartphone keyboards almost completely, because the speech recognition on my Android phone made typing a waste of time. And if your PC has a microphone, you can use speech recognition in Google Docs with a Chrome-type browser.Of course, speech recognition has been part of Windows for two decades, and in Windows 10, you can turn it on and off by pressing WinKey-Ctrl-S. There are also good specialised programs such as Nuance’s Dragon Dictate. But programs that run only on a local PC have a hard time competing with ones that use servers with AI and access to petabytes of data.The latest version of Gmail includes predictive text by default. Basically, Gmail’s Smart Compose system tries to complete your sentences and you just hit the tab key to accept its suggestion. It’s intended for writing emails, but you can write whatever you like, then copy and paste your text into a real document.Smart Compose might help smartphone users, but it’s worse than useless if you’re a touch-typist with a proper keyboard. Just thinking about whether to accept Smart Compose’s suggestions is distracting, and it’s usually far quicker to ignore them and just keep typing.To disable the Smart Compose and Smart Reply features in Gmail, click the cogwheel icon and select Settings. Go down the General menus and click the radio buttons to set “Writing suggestions off” and “Smart Reply off”. You can tell all your friends how easy it is to do this.Many programs will offer to complete a word once you have started typing it LibreOffice is a good example. (See my earlier answer on the difference between LibreOffice and OpenOffice.)LibreOffice has an AutoCorrect feature that remembers every eight-letter (or longer) word you type. The next time you type the first three letters of that word, it will offer to complete it. Again, this is annoying and will slow down a fast typist, but some users will find it a boon. It could work if you delete words you don’t want auto-completed and just type three letters plus Enter for long words you use often.In LibreOffice Writer, go to Tools, select AutoCorrect and then AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialogue box has a tab for Word Completion. There you can set the minimum word length and change the “Accept with” key from Enter to Tab or, perhaps, the space bar.The common trick in Microsoft Office is to set up AutoCorrect options for long words or phrases that you use often. For example, #tyf could be autocorrected to “Thank you for your letter” while #csi could automatically insert chrono-synclastic infundibulum, or whatever.You could use the same approach system-wide with a program such as AutoHotKey. Better still, you could add a script that someone has already written, such as Uberi’s Autocomplete 1.2. The code is on GitHub so you could even adapt it yourself.As an alternative, FastKeys is a reasonably priced ($19 for three PCs) commercial Windows automation program specifically designed to save you typing.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Now the beleaguered species is facing an unexpected new challenge – eels getting stuck up their noses.A picture of a monk seal with an eel up its nose was shared this week by a Hawaii-based ision of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The episode was just the latest eel-in-snout incident to occur in the past two years, baffling researchers.“We’ve been intensively monitoring monk seals for four decades and in all of that time nothing like this has happened,” said Charles Littnan, the lead scientist at Noaa’s Hawaiian monk seal research program. “Now it’s happened three or four times and we have no idea why.”Researchers first spotted a seal with an eel nasal appendage in the summer of 2016, emailing colleagues who initially thought it was a joke. It has since happened enough times for the monk seal program to develop guidelines on how to remove the eels.“They get stuck in there really snug, so you have to restrain the seal and give the eel a firm tug to get it out,” said Littnan. “One of them was really far in so it was like a magician’s handkerchief trick, we just had to keep pulling and pulling.”The phenomena could cause potential problems for the seals in terms of infections or even by affecting their ability to e and feed on marine creatures. Seals typically seal their nostrils shut when ing into the water, a process hampered by the presence of a nose-dwelling eel. “Having a rotten fish inside your nose is bound to cause some problems,” Littnan lamented.Researchers have managed to successfully remove all of the protruding eels, all from juvenile seals, but are still trying to ascertain why this is happening.One theory is that seals, which often regurgitate their meals, are simply throwing up eels through their noses. Another is that startled eels get stuck there while attempting to flee the seals as the predators forage for food beneath rocks. Either way, scientists are unsure why this nasal entrapment is only now being witnessed by humans.“If I had to guess, I would say that it’s one of those strange oddities,” Littnan said. “If you observe nature long enough, you’ll see strange things.”Monk seals are endemic to Hawaii and are listed in the US as an endangered species, with around 1,400 iniduals remaining. Threats including fishing and disease, with climate change another looming challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100ec210eaadd59a794714fe698e04b692b9d627/187_419_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7cde1ee857471538c67061808e8b012","title":"on the road venezuela 20 years after hugo chavez rise","story":" travels across the nation the late Hugo Chávez dreamed of transforming, to understand its collapseThe latrines at Simón Bolívar international airport in Caracas overflow with urine the taps are bone dry. In the departures hall, weeping passengers prepare for exile, unsure when they will return.At customs, a sticker on one x-ray machine warns: “Here you don’t speak badly about Chávez!”But even before stepping outside the terminal it is obvious his Bolivarian revolution, like the airport’s immobile escalators, has ground to a halt.On 6 December 1998, Hugo Chávez proclaimed a new dawn of social justice and people power. “Venezuela’s resurrection is under way and nothing and nobody can stop it,” the leftwing populist told a sea of euphoric supporters after his landslide election victory.Two decades on, those dreams are in tatters.To understand Venezuela’s collapse, the  travelled hundreds of miles across the nation Chávez dreamed of transforming, from the spot in downtown Caracas where he gave his first speech as president-elect to his birthplace in the country’s sun-scorched southwestern plains.On the way, we encountered lingering affection for a charismatic populist still celebrated as a champion of the poor, and a determination among Venezuelans from all walks of life to somehow weather the economic cyclone ravaging their country.But above all, there was deprivation, hunger, profound apprehension and seething anger – even among proud chavistas – at a government now incapable of fulfilling its citizens’ most basic needs, and in denial over a humanitarian crisis unprecedented in modern Latin American history.“People do not understand what is happening in Venezuela because it is too hard to believe,” says Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor in the city of Barquisimeto, describing the implosion of a health service that was once the envy of the region. “The most oil-rich country absolutely devastated and turned into a war-torn nation – without a war.“I’m not angry. I’m terribly sad. Because there was absolutely no need to get to this point. They just left the country to die … and it is heartbreaking.”Twenty years after Chávez declared Venezuela’s rebirth, its capital is on its knees. Billboards try to persuade citizens that “together everything is possible” but the mood is funereal and dazed.By night, swaths of the city resemble a disaster zone: deserted, carless streets are plunged into darkness by power outages and broken street lights. Famished citizens probe uncollected heaps of rubbish.“The feeling I have is one of a slow-motion catastrophe,” says Ana Teresa Torres, a Caracas-based author. “It’s as if you are watching a building collapse and there is nothing you can do to stop it.”Despite the meltdown, in a traditionally chavista shantytown called San Agustín, there is still devotion to the politician many call “mi comandante”.“He was the man who took the poor out of the catacombs,” says Gilda González, 50, the local coordinator of Misión Ribas, an educational programme Chávez set up in 2003.González, a self-declared revolucionaria who keeps Fidel Castro’s memoirs by her desk, pointed to an horizon of government-built apartment blocks. “Everything you see here today was the comandante’s doing, and our president, Nicolás Maduro, is fighting hard to continue that work,” she said of the man who inherited Chávez’s revolution after he died in 2013.Venezuela’s leaders blame the country’s plight on sanctions and an “economic war” waged by what the foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, recently called the “extremist, supremacist, racist” government of Donald Trump. “It’s not just an economic war​,​ it’s an all-round war – a political war, a media war and a trade war,” Arreaza claimed.González agrees, and warns Bolivarian militias will resist if the US president makes good on insinuations that Maduro could be toppled by foreign force. “We are ready for asymmetric war,” she says.But as Venezuela staggers deeper into ruin, once-ardent believers are losing their faith. Pedro García, a chavista social worker and musician in the same community, claims Chávez’s heirs have led the country into an abyss of political infighting and thievery. As if to confirm his point, the following day Chávez’s former treasurer was sentenced to 10 years in jail in the US for taking more than a billion dollars in bribes.García said he continued to treasure the ideals underpinning Chávez’s Bolivarian struggle – but under Maduro, Venezuela had become like a pressure cooker that had been left on for too long. “This mess will explode any minute.”“See this? This is our country,” says Lilibeth Sandoval, a lawyer and regional representative of the opposition group Vente Venezuela, as she tiptoes through the debris of a derelict textile mill Chávez toured 13 years ago. “Destroyed!”At a nearby petrol station, attendants complain they have not been paid in months by Pdvsa, the state-run oil company that oversees the world’s biggest crude reserves. “And this is still a good job,” says Eduardo Martínez. Tips from drivers mean it is just about possible to survive.But Martínez’s trousers are shredded, his shoes filled with holes, and he has a seeping, untreated abscess on his left wrist. “One day this will all come crashing down, just like the Twin Towers,” he says.A grinning Maduro stares down from a billboard at the turn-off to the rural town of Macapo, alongside the rallying cry: “Vamos Venezuela.”Thousands of locals have already gone.The United Nations estimates 3 million have fled the country since 2015 to escape chronic food and medicine shortages, crumbling healthcare and transport systems and an economy in freefall.No life has been untouched and Guevara, 53, is no exception.In February his wife, Glenda, set off overland for Peru with a group of 15 relatives. She works as a carer-cum-accountant in Lima and sends funds to help her husband who lives off a weekly pension of about 900 bolivares (about $1.8) – an almost impossible task because of rampant hyperinflation that Maduro’s supposedly visionary economic recovery plan has failed to tame.“That’s not even enough to buy a kilo of cheese,” says Guevara.With his wife gone, Guevara has busied himself decorating his home ahead of a lonely Christmas. “This year there will be an emptiness,” he says, tears welling in his eyes.Guevara says he believes political change is on the horizon and Venezuela’s diaspora will soon return to rebuild their homeland. But like all those the  interviewed, he is unable to say how or when.Venezuela’s opposition is fractured and, while localised protests continue, the mass demonstrations of last year have faded, with many participants chosing instead to leave the country.Top chavista officials deny their citizens are going hungry and have called the migration crisis fake news. A visit to the one-room hovel Ivan Henríquez shares with his wife and six children in the city of Barquisimeto gives the lie to those claims. “They are living in a parallel world,” the 35-year-old says of the daily churn of disinformation on state TV.As Venezuela’s crisis has deepened over the past year, Henríquez, like millions of his fellow citizens, has found it increasingly hard to feed his family, let alone himself. “I used to weigh something like 70kg – now I’m 50kg, or less,” he says, showing the contents of their pantry: a half-empty sack of maize and a plastic bag filled with a few sticks of cassava.Outside, in a rubbish-strewn garden, his children – aged from 11 months to 13 – study around a table fashioned from a broken door with breezeblocks as legs.“So many people are dying of hunger in this country … children are dying because of malnutrition,” he says, lowering his voice to avoid his own offspring overhearing that bleak assessment.Henríquez blames his family’s plight on an ideological clash from which his country’s leaders have refused to step back. “Venezuelans are stuck in the middle of a war that isn’t theirs.”The highway to Barinas, the south-western state where Chávez grew up, is dotted with reminders of Venezuela’s decay: families hauling armfuls of firewood or hiking down the hard shoulder because public buses are now as hard to find as food police barricades where forlorn-looking officers shake down passersby for a pittance abandoned factories, grain silos and car showrooms being reclaimed by the undergrowth graffiti demanding the removal of the man most blame for the calamity – “¡Fuera Maduro!” – and patches of scorched asphalt where tires have been burned by protesters.Fading Socialist party murals insist everything is in order: “Chávez vive y la patria sigue!” (“Chávez lives and the homeland goes on!”)But these days few are fooled by such claims. “Our lives are becoming impossible,” says Ezequiel Mota, a 73-year-old farmer, queuing outside a military controlled petrol station in the state capital. He expects to be there for at least 10 hours.Across town the  saw three petrol queues of more than 140 cars each. In the countryside, a driver in an even longer line of vehicles says he has been waiting two days: “Sometimes it’s four.”“Ninety per cent of citizens are against the government because they are leading us into the most absolute state of misery and poverty in the world,” Mota says. “That’s the truth.”Rosa Rivas has a poster from Chávez’s final election campaign in pride of place on the wall of her sitting room. “I have so much faith in the president,” she says. “I fear nothing when he’s close by.”Rivas, at 85 still chavista to the bone, recalls wanting to die when she heard of her protector’s passing. “I love him,” she whispers.But in the town where Chávez was born, such dedication appears to be fading.Palencia, 46, says shortages of food, medicine, gas, petrol and drinking water mean many residents are turning against Chávez’s “malignant legacy”.A minstrel as well as a militant, Palencia reaches for a Venezuelan four-string guitar to perform his musical rebuke to chavismo. “From here in Barinas, I want to ask my Venezuela for forgiveness,” he sings. “Because we know it was here that the disaster began, it was here that the comandante who destroyed my nation was born.”Palencia’s mother, Vidalina, grew up with “Huguito” and cheered his rise to power in 1998. “I felt proud that a boy I knew was going to be president of the republic and suddenly everything was going to change,” the 68-year-old says.But Vidalina’s feelings shifted for good after she was diagnosed with cancer and – like millions of ailing Venezuelans – was unable to find the drugs she needed. “My only desire is for this mistaken revolution to end.”In 2016 Vladimir Putin donated a granite statue of Chávez to Sabaneta and it was placed in one of its main squares to celebrate the legacy of “the illustrious son of the Venezuelan people”.Today it is chipped and charred having been set upon by anti-government protesters. They failed to tear it down, but have vowed to return.Nearby, Chávez’s childhood home is open to the public as a tribute to Venezuela’s “21st-century liberator” and his Bolivarian crusade. But it, too, has fallen on hard times. One room lacks a lightbulb in another, a display case holding a pair of maracas has fallen off the wall and is propped up on two plastic chairs.Outside on the veranda, beside a mango tree the comandante once scaled, there is a guestbook containing homages that sometimes hint at Venezuela’s decline. “Very good,” one pilgrim wrote in April. “But lacking in electricity.”The museum caretaker, charged with receiving tourists since its two unpaid guides quit earlier this year, invites his latest visitors to add their names to the revolutionary register.There was just one problem. “We don’t have a pencil right now.”Additional reporting Patricia Torres and Clavel Rangel• This article was amended on 6 December 2018 to replace the word “exasperated” in the heading on a graph, where “exacerbated” was meant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e0daaef153fce510be0f378cc3cf8ec0331f03d/0_13_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b683e5f811442f5bb96914573458d4a","title":"macrons arrogance unites us on the barricades with frances gilets jaunes","story":"Grassroots citizens’ revolt against fuel tax rises has morphed into president’s biggest crisisOn the grass verge of a village roundabout north of Toulouse, Céline stood at a barricade built from pallets of wood and old tyres, a bonfire burning behind her. French flags were flying alongside signs calling for Emmanuel Macron’s resignation.“I’m prepared to spend Christmas protesting at this roundabout with my children – we won’t back down and we’ve got nothing to lose,” said the 41-year-old, who voted for Macron in last year’s presidential election. “He gave good speeches and I really believed his promises that he would change France. But not any more.”Céline, a classroom assistant for children with special needs, earns €800 (£710) a month. She cannot afford rent so lives with her four children in a relative’s house in the suburbs of Toulouse, in the south-west of France.“Macron’s first move in office was to slash the wealth tax for the mega-rich while cutting money from poor people’s housing benefits,” she said. “That is a serious injustice. The country is rising up and he’s staying silent, he’s hiding in an ivory tower, that’s what disturbs me, he’s not taking responsibility.”At the roundabout barricade in Lespinasse, 20 people from surrounding villages – builders, nurses, workers in the local aviation industry – protested near a crucial fuel depot, wearing the yellow high-visibility vests that define France’s gilets jaunes movement. Passing trucks and cars beeped in support. Drivers leaned out of their windows and shouted “Don’t give up!”This grassroots citizens’ protest, which began as a spontaneous revolt against fuel tax rises last month, has morphed into an anti-government and anti-Macron movement and is now the young centrist president’s biggest crisis. The demonstrators say that Macron is an arrogant would-be monarch. He presents himself abroad, they say, as a progressive hero who can hold back the tide of nationalism, but at home he symbolises a distant political elite, stoking distrust and pushing people towards populism.“I always feared that there was an element of dictator in the way Macron did things,” said Robert, 64, a leftwing Toulouse carpenter and cabinet maker. “He’s well-presented and he speaks nicely – but he misread these protests because he thought he was the saviour of France. He wasn’t listening, he forgot the human factor.”Last Saturday saw the worst street unrest in central Paris in decades, as fringe elements of the otherwise peaceful protesters fought running battles with riot police and set cars alight. Tourist attractions and museums in Paris will be closed on Saturday, and the government has warned that thousands of rioters might come to the capital to “smash” or even “kill”. Yet gilets jaunes across France are determined to march in towns and cities this weekend anyway.Crucially, the government fears violence not just in Paris but outside it. Local government offices were torched in the small central town of Puy-en-Velay last weekend. In Toulouse, there were running battles with riot police with several injured. Motorway toll-booths have been burned down and vandalised in southern France, and when high-school students staged demonstrations this week against university and school reforms, riot police fired teargas at several demonstrations. The entrance hall of a high school in Blagnac outside Toulouse was burned to the ground.One transport worker in his 20s who took part in a street march in the small country town of Montauban in the south-west said he was shocked by the teargas. “Things will kick off for sure again this weekend, there could be violence anywhere in France,” he said.The roundabouts and motorway toll-booths that gilets jaunes continue to blockade are often near small towns and villages that do not normally make the news. Main cities are often far away, meaning residents cannot work or take children to school without a car – hence their fury at fuel tax rises.Isabelle, 41, a single mother, had never taken part in a protest movement before. She works at a sandwich stand at Toulouse airport for the minimum wage – less than €1,200 a month – and her daily shifts begin at 3am. She was among many who had deliberately spoiled her ballot paper in last year’s presidential election final round, unwilling to choose between Macron or the far-right Marine Le Pen.“This is now about so much more than fuel tax,” she said. “We seem to live in a world gone mad where the rich pay next to nothing and the poor are constantly taxed. We’ve had enough of the elite.”The gilets jaunes movement is unlike any other seen in postwar France because it sprang up online without a leader, trade union or party behind it. Along the barricades there is a broad mix of people, some apolitical, some on the left who feared nationalism, some who had voted for the nationalist Le Pen, some environmentalists. Many were against the European Union, feeling it enshrined rampant capitalism.One 24-year-old philosophy student said: “This feels like a historic moment in France. I’d liken it to the Arab spring – a kind of revolution that started online.”Although the demonstrators have complained that poor people bear the brunt of France’s high taxation, they are still attached to public services. A banner on a building in Lespinasse read: “We want a train station.” Across France, rural areas have complained about depleted public services. There was a sense that public money was being misspent and used primarily to maintain the plush lifestyle of a political elite.“Hospitals are understaffed and under financed,” said a 39-year-old nurse from a Toulouse hospital. “But what has united everyone is Macron’s arrogance. He has made the tension worse, like a little king pitching himself against a whole nation. Macron has held us to ransom saying he was the only one who could hold back nationalism and Le Pen, but he has no credibility at all in France.”Fabien Mauret, a self-employed builder, was cooking sausages on a barbecue for the protesters. “I think we’ve got to the point of no return,” he said. “Before, there were the rich, the middle and the poor. Now it’s the very rich and the poor, nothing in between.”He used to vote Socialist but now he votes Le Pen. “These roundabout protests are jolly. But the government knows that demonstrations could get ugly. I don’t think that’s a good thing, but it’s the reality.”Raymond Stocco, 64, who used to work in aircraft maintenance, suggested the mega-rich should be forced to pay back the tax breaks they had enjoyed over the past four years. “Macron’s big mistake was treating people in France as if we were stupid,” he said.In this corner of rural and suburban south-west France, protesters planned to expand to blockading hypermarkets as a way to force people back to small local shops.Many said the movement will last, in part because of the community feeling it had engendered. Alexandre, a retired trucker who lived in a caravan, was spending his 63rd birthday at the barricade. “I’m less lonely when I come here to talk politics to everyone,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Health professionals have \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo January 1st introduction is being rushedFinal report into Caitriona Lucas\u0026rsquos death finds deficiencies in safety managementAnalysis: Woefully inadequate winter plan and extra funding are coming late in the daySt James\u0026rsquos Hospital initiative also ensures well patients are discharged promptlyPublic sector bodies saved 667,000 tonnes of \u0026lsquoavoided CO2 emissions\u0026rsquo in 2017Jonathan Bell taped \u0026lsquopersonal and private\u0026rsquo conversation on botched project in 2015Process auditor questioned about his National Broadband Plan investigationMinister for Health says he intends to bring forward stand-alone legislation next yearGarda\u0026iacute issue appeal for information on event in Co Longford that left man injuredUnions hold talks on Irish Water plans with MinisterMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy tells D\u0026aacuteil families will not be evictedJohn Dowling \u0026lsquoloved what he taught and the people he taught it to\u0026rsquoSmall hospital radiology departments under pressure due to inadequate staffingBlack bins in commercial businesses contain more than a third food waste, study findsJudge says people must watch out for themselves as she dismisses case\u0026lsquoThe scars and memories that are in my head are something that will always be with me\u0026rsquoJim Donegan was targeted while he waited to collect his teenage sonTurn of phrase was in context of a proposed change to administrative boundary, court told"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe UK could “sleep-walk off the cliff edge” with no deal on exiting the EU if Theresa May’s plan is rejected next week and she does not call off Brexit, London mayor Sadiq Khan has warned.On a visit to Dublin, the Labour politician said he expected the UK parliament to reject Mrs May’s proposed Brexit agreement in next Tuesday’s vote and for his party then to call for a general election.“We will have to wait and see if there are enough MPs to vote for that. If that doesn’t happen, the next best thing is a people’s vote,” Mr Khan said after addressing a business audience in Dublin.The London mayor said a no-deal exit increased the chance of a hard Irish border.A prominent pro-EU campaigner during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, Mr Khan wants to see a second public vote on the UK’s decision to leave the EU giving the people “a say in whether we accept the deal or no deal with the option of staying”.“Now we know that the promises made in 2016 were a lie. Now we know what the terms of exiting the EU, either a bad deal or no deal whatsoever,” he told The .“The British public will vote to stay and the reality is that in 2016 so many of those who campaigned to leave told lies and the British public were sold a false prospective.”Mr Khan said he was “not a fan of ‘best of three or five’ referendums” – nor did he believe in “never-endums” – but he felt that the British public would take a different view on leaving the EU now and that politicians “shouldn’t be scared about the British public taking back control”.“Now we know there isn’t the land of milk and honey outside the EU but actually the terms of exit aren’t great. The British public can now vote with foresight and knowledge on whether we are going to accept exit on the terms we have been given or the option of staying in the EU,” he said.During his day-long visit to Dublin, Mr Khan met President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Government Buildings.The British politician expressed concerns about the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit not just on London or the wider UK economy but on the European Union too.“My worry is that we could sleep-walk off the cliff edge and leave the EU with no deal whatsoever. It is bad for London, bad for the UK and bad for Europe. That is why Theresa May should stop governing in the party interest and think about the country,” he said in an interview.He declined to say whether Mrs May should resign if her deal falls at the parliamentary hurdle.In a speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Mr Khan called on Mrs May to halt the country’s exit from the EU if she fails to get her proposed orce deal from the EU passed by parliament.The prime minister should, he said, withdraw the article 50 application taking the UK out of the EU on March 29th, 2019 if parliament rejects her deal, “which is looking extremely likely.”“The very notion of a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table by the British government. It is just too dangerous to leave as a possibility,” he said.Withdrawing article 50 in the event of parliament rejecting her deal was “the single best way to guarantee that we avoid falling off a cliff-edge”, he said.“It would stop the clock that is ticking towards a no deal Brexit and it would provide the breaking space to decide how we resolve this mess,” he said.A no-deal exit was the “worst possible outcome”, he said, and this remained “a grave concern given the political uncertainty at Westminster”.“This would not only be devastating for London’s economy but could actually hurt businesses across Europe, including here in Dublin, and increase the chance of a hard border on the island of Ireland, ” he said.Mr Khan poked fun at Mrs May in his speech saying that she has as much chance of passing through parliament “as her securing the lead role in the next production of Riverdance”.“And those of you who have seen those dance moves know exactly what I mean,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723046.1544128301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords hears of laughter in tipperary and galway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Pro-EU supporters call for a People’s Vote outside the British Houses of Parliament on  December 6th, 2018:   Some claim the backstop creates a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. Photograph: Andy RainAlthough most of this week’s political drama has taken place in the House of Commons, they have also been debating Theresa May’s Brexit deal at the other end of the Palace of Westminster in the House of Lords.On Thursday, former first minister David Trimble complained that the Northern Ireland protocol had been drawn up by members of the French administrative elite of énarques, who were “deeply imbued with a different way of approaching things”.“That protocol is not a democratic one and it undermines the Belfast Agreement.\u0026nbspOver the past year or two, people have expressed concern that this process might damage it. Yes, but it is not the desire to leave the EU that is causing the damage it is what the EU is doing by way of reprisal, aimed not just at us in Northern Ireland but at the UK as a whole,” he said.Historian Paul Bew offered a more thoughtful analysis on Wednesday when he acknowledged the need to address the difficulties Brexit created in Ireland.But he argued that Britain’s cast-iron assurance that it would not create a hard border meant that its efforts in the negotiations were aimed at ensuring that the EU did not oblige Ireland to do so.“Maybe we were right to do it, but we should be absolutely clear that that is what we have been doing. We have put ourselves through a lot of pain to do it, and I absolutely accept it is right to be sensitive to the needs and problems created for Ireland by Brexit,” he said.He said the backstop created a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. This was, he said, inconsistent with the model of North-South co-operation in the Belfast Agreement.“This is a huge difficulty that will have to be attended to otherwise, we lose the template of the Good Friday agreement, which all parties in Northern Ireland accept. Even now, when we cannot make it work, everybody accepts that that is the basic template for a settlement. If we throw it away, which will be the effect of going along these lines, we will be taking a massive risk with the stability of Northern Ireland.”Ulster Unionist peer Reg Empey pointed to the huge preponderance of Irish trade that goes across the Irish Sea rather than across the Border, suggesting that Ireland’s real border with the UK was eastwest rather than northsouth. But in the commons on Thursday, Labour’s Chris Ruane, who represents the Vale of Clwyd, reminded MPs that any disruption to trade across the Irish Sea would hurt parts of Wales almost as much as Ireland.“We have heard about the 17-mile tailbacks that would affect Dover. Seven-mile tailbacks are predicted for Holyhead. We are already seeing sea lanes open from Cork to Santander and from Cork to Rotterdam. If we lose the sea lanes and lose that trade with Ireland, which is as big as the trade with Brazil, Russia and India combined – it is worth over £45 billion – that will be a problem,” he said.The SNP’s Angus Brendan MacNeil noted that Thursday was the 96th anniversary of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, adding that Brexit had shown the Irish they were right to become independent. Casual Irish schadenfreude and aggressive bluster about Brexit has bruised some feelings at Westminster but MacNeil relished it.“The escaped Irish have belly laughs, and their biggest wind-up is to go on television at various points of crisis and tell the UK to stay calm. Back in Tipperary, Waterford and Galway they are laughing, because they know exactly what it means to tell London to stay calm,” he said.Earlier, MPs rubbed their eyes as they watched Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who once praised “the bombs and bullets and sacrifice” of the IRA, denounce the backstop as a threat to the union. Almost as improbably, Ian Paisley quoted C Desmond Greaves, the Marxist historian who acted as a muse to IRA chief of staff Cathal Goulding in the 1960s.“All fundamental battles in British politics take place in the Conservative Party, with everyone else having bit parts,” Greaves said.\u0026nbspAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723063.1544127962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may ministerial roadshow to comb britain to promote brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May lights up Downing Street Christmas tree: “Overwhelmingly, the message I’ve heard is that people want us to get on with it.” Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPAUp to 30 of Theresa May’s ministers will fan out across Britain on Friday to make the case for her Brexit deal, amid ever louder calls to postpone next week’s vote to avoid a crushing defeat. The ministers will visit schools, hospitals, factories and other workplaces to argue that the deal will protect the economy, jobs and public services.“I’ve been speaking to factory workers in Scotland, farmers in Wales and people right across the country, answering their questions about the deal and our future. Overwhelmingly, the message I’ve heard is that people want us to get on with it. And that’s why it’s important that ministers are out speaking with communities across the UK today about how the deal works for them,” the British prime minister said.Downing Street insisted on Thursday that MPs will vote on the Brexit deal next Tuesday, despite Mrs May’s apparent failure to win over critics within her own party. Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, said he would welcome a delay if it helped to address MPs’ concerns over the Northern Ireland backstop.“I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop, Northern Ireland protocol situation if we were to enter into one in the future.\u0026nbspIt’s having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing,” Sir Graham told the BBC.“So if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days, then all well and good.\u0026nbspIf it can’t then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.”The prime minister is considering how to reassure MPs that they can decide whether to enter the backstop or remain in a transition arrangement, following all EU rules and paying into its budget. They will be able to make such a choice in June 2020 but the transition can only be extended for a maximum of a further two years.Under the withdrawal agreement, Britain would then automatically enter the backstop if a new arrangement that keeps the Border open had not been agreed. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday that the EU would not reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement.“I must say once again today, calmly and clearly, it is the only and best possible agreement,” he said.“Everybody needs to do their bit, everybody needs to take on the responsibility. The British parliament will be voting on this in the next few days. This has serious implications for the future of the country.”On the third day of the Commons debate on the deal, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit would\u0026nbspmean tariffs, paperwork and bureaucracy as well as disruption to trade.“I do not believe that we can afford the economic cost of a no-deal exit,” he said.\u0026nbspAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

In October the embassy ordered him to take better care of the catMr Moreno earlier this year announced that he was severing Mr Assange\u0027s telephone and internet links, and in October said he was banning him from making political statement that jeopardised Ecuador\u0027s relations with other countries. Mr Assange then sued for a breach of his human rights.From December, he was also due to pay for his own costs of food, medical care and laundry, in yet another sign of the growing impatience of the Ecuadorean government.Mr Moreno added that Britain had guaranteed that the Australian would not be extradited to any country where his life is in danger.But Mr Assange\u0027s lawyer, Barry Pollack, told The  that the deal was not acceptable.The legal team have long argued that they will not accept any agreement which risks his being extradited to the United States.Julian Assange participates via video link at a news conference marking the 10th anniversary of WikiLeaks, in Berlin in October 2016Last year Jeff Sessions, the former US attorney general, said arresting Mr Assange was a priority.In November a filing error revealed that Mr Assange faced charges in the US - although it was not clear what those charges were.Many speculate they would be connected to the release of classified information, and Mr Assange fears a long prison sentence in the US for what his supporters say is publishing information in the public interest.The suggestion that as long as the death penalty is off the table, Mr Assange need not fear persecution is obviously wrong, said Mr Pollack. No one should have to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information. Since such charges appear to have been brought against Mr Assange in the United States, Ecuador should continue to provide him asylum.Mr Assange fled to the embassy when he was wanted for questioning in Sweden about sexual assault allegations. He always maintained his innocence and Swedish authorities later said they had dropped their extradition request.He does, however, still face charges in the UK of skipping bail.Death on the road: Traffic accidents kill more than malaria, HIV and TBPakistan expels 18 charities amid lingering fallout from bin Laden raidOne dead and five missing after US military aircraft crash off JapanComment: The Bush nostalgia is predictable but this is Trump\u0026#39s America nowAfghanistan\u0026#39s \u0026#39little Messi\u0026#39 leaves behind signed shirt as family flees Taliban offensiveC-sections to be performed by healthcare assistants, report predictsBoss of disabled car supplier in line for £2.2m bonus, Government spending inquiry findsMigrant rescue vessel Aquarius ends operations in MediterraneanBuzzcocks singer Pete Shelley dies from suspected heart attack aged 63Half of burglaries now take place when people are at home as police \u0026#39inaction\u0026#39 makes criminals bolderJohn McDonnell\u0026#39s \u0026#34lynching\u0026#34 comments incited violence and compromised my safety, says Esther McVeyEsther McVey: I knew Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal was terrible but my Cabinet colleagues just crumbledA day when Theresa May’s indecision had even loyalists wondering what will happen next Comment: In what could be the final days of May\u0026#39s premiership, Operation Stop Boris is already in full swingSize of task facing Theresa May  becomes clear as footage shows chief whip failing to get Tory MP on boardBrexit latest news: Cabinet ministers demand answers as Chief Whip admits May will lose Tuesday’s voteComment: As with Gordon Brown, we never see the great raconteur that lies within Theresa May Illegal immigrant \u0026#39made Donald Trump\u0026#39s bed and dusted his golf trophies\u0026#39Teenager terror suspect arrests are highest for almost two decadesTelevised leaders\u0026#39 debate on Brexit deal collapses as ITV scraps plan for head-to-headLibDem MP quits party whip to back Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6 december 2018","story":"The British Museum press launch of their Manga exhibition, which opens 23 May 2019.

They later met in Qatar where the superstar was playing a friendly.Murtaza in his homemade shirt fashioned from a plastic bagHowever, the attention brought threats.Local strongmen were calling and saying, \u0027You have become rich, pay the money you have received from Messi or we will take your son\u0027, said his mother Shafiqa. The family feared the worst when a Taliban offensive brought fighting towards their home. They left when they heard gunshots.We couldn\u0027t take any of our belongings, we left only with our lives, added Shafiqa.The family belongs to the Shia Hazara ethnic group, who were singled out by the Sunni Taliban during their November operation in Ghazni.The UN said up to 4,000 families fled, with witnesses describing scenes of absolute terror to AFP.Shafiqa said she hid her famous son\u0027s face with a scarf to prevent him from being recognised as they fled.They took refuge first in a mosque in Bamiyan, before arriving in Kabul six days later. Among their belongings left behind are the football and the jersey signed by Messi.Although Afghan security forces have beaten back the Taliban in Jaghori, the family says it no longer feels safe.The danger of the Taliban coming back is high, going back is not an option, Shafiqa said.The family have already fled once before, to Pakistan in 2016, where they sought asylum in any safe country.They returned reluctantly to Jaghori after their money ran out, she said.Murtaza\u0027s father Arif remains in Jaghori working as a farmer while his family lives in Kabul.Death on the road: Traffic accidents kill more than malaria, HIV and TBPakistan expels 18 charities amid lingering fallout from bin Laden raidOne dead and five missing after US military aircraft crash off JapanComment: The Bush nostalgia is predictable but this is Trump\u0026#39s America nowBoss of disabled car supplier in line for £2.2m bonus, Government spending inquiry findsC-sections to be performed by healthcare assistants, report predictsMigrant rescue vessel Aquarius ends operations in MediterraneanBuzzcocks singer Pete Shelley dies from suspected heart attack aged 63John McDonnell\u0026#39s \u0026#34lynching\u0026#34 comments incited violence and compromised my safety, says Esther McVeyHalf of burglaries now take place when people are at home as police \u0026#39inaction\u0026#39 makes criminals bolderEsther McVey: I knew Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal was terrible but my Cabinet colleagues just crumbledComment: In what could be the final days of May\u0026#39s premiership, Operation Stop Boris is already in full swingA day when Theresa May’s indecision had even loyalists wondering what will happen next Size of task facing Theresa May  becomes clear as footage shows chief whip failing to get Tory MP on boardBrexit latest news: Cabinet ministers demand answers as Chief Whip admits May will lose Tuesday’s voteComment: As with Gordon Brown, we never see the great raconteur that lies within Theresa May Illegal immigrant \u0026#39made Donald Trump\u0026#39s bed and dusted his golf trophies\u0026#39Teenager terror suspect arrests are highest for almost two decadesTelevised leaders\u0026#39 debate on Brexit deal collapses as ITV scraps plan for head-to-headLibDem MP quits party whip to back Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealBBC to air musical comedy based on the life of Meghan Markle: the \u0026#39Sixth In Line to be King and I\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/06/16/broadband.jpg","title":"broadband providers bt virgin media talktalk plusnet loyalty penalty","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

One is called Eloise, the other is ViaVan. You might think giving birth could get in the way of doing the top job. Not so for Oppetit. Almost the opposite in fact. The embryonic ViaVan was taking shape at around the same time as her second daughter. And they called her four days after the birth to ask if she would consider being “head of London”. Now Eloise is four months old and her Mum is running the newest car-sharing “corner to corner” setup in the capital. “I still get back to put her to bed at night though,” she says, in a café down the street from the ViaVan base near Liverpool Street. Oppetit has a Lauren Bacall-style huskiness but with an Australian accent. She was born in Melbourne 32 years ago and studied law and commerce at the University of Melbourne. Her first job was on the law side, working on sex-offender cases. “I wasn’t sure I could have defended some of these guys with the appropriate level of neutrality,” she says. Not when there was a high risk of reoffending. “I realised I was more into the commerce side.” Houzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Green Man Gaming CEO Paul Sulyok A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techA View from the top: Will Ramsay, CEO of the Affordable Art FairMelbourne is a lovely city and most of her friends and peers were staying put, settling down,\u0026nbspgetting married\u0026nbspand moving into houses a couple of blocks away from where their parents lived. Which is when Oppetit took off to do an MBA at Harvard Business School, where she spent two years, meeting “incredible and impressive women” and her future French husband who, she says, “was completely not my type – like no one I’d ever met before”.At school in Australia she had had a choice between learning Japanese or French – and opted for Japanese. “I thought it was more likely I’d become a sushi chef than marry a Frenchman.” Despite which they went back to Australia together and ended up in Singapore in 2014, where the now Mrs Oppetit worked for Apple in operations, taking up with Tim Cook’s old team. After a few years in Asia, the Oppetits – all 3 of them – agreed on going back to Europe and settled in London, where her husband had been brought up and had family. Oppetit, whose first daughter was three months old at the time, was adamant about going back to work. It was her sister in New York who recommended Via, which was setting up in Europe. “I wasn’t really a techie startup kind of person, but I thought what the hell, let’s find out more about it.” She went along, got interviewed all day long, and decided she wanted more. “You get a feeling,” she says. “It was a just a massive hit.” She joined Via in June 2017. The original plan was to launch Via in Europe in Amsterdam, which was well disposed on environmental grounds. But then Uber lost its licence in London\u0026nbspat the same time Via was granted a licence and it all kicked off right here\u0026nbspin April 2018. Drivers were queueing around the block to sign up. Literally (for once). The line was six to seven hours long and many had to be sent away to come back the next day. Oppetit would lose her voice every day trying to get drivers registered. “You’ve got a big tummy!” said one of the guys. “You can’t say that!” said another, more sensitively. She was five months pregnant at the time and didn’t object particularly. And she was sympathetic to the drivers. “Uber hadn’t had a lot of competition and the drivers were undervalued and badly treated. They wanted something else.” The projected figures for the end of year two\u0026nbspwere achieved in just one month. Business was exploding. “It felt like I was really using my MBA,” she said. “It felt real. It was madness, but in a good way.” So when she got the call, second-time motherhood or not,\u0026nbspshe knew she had to take the job. “I’m in if you really want it,” said her supportive husband. She specified she wouldn’t come back for two\u0026nbspmonths and had to have a month off around Christmas to show off\u0026nbspthe new baby to family in Australia. Since she came back at the end of August, it’s been “the two best months we’ve had at Via”. They’re now over 3\u0026nbspmillion rides.Maybe you really can have it all. Oppetit sees no contradiction between motherhood and managing a huge operation. “You just have to do what comes naturally.” The fact that she has two daughters makes a difference. “I want them to feel that they can do anything. And the advantage is they’re too young to be able to comment on my lifestyle choices.” The other upside is that now their father “has more opportunity to do what he thinks is right for a change”.Four out of the six senior management at Via are women. And out of 20 staff, 15 are from Australia or New Zealand. “They’re all on the big adventure,” Oppetit says. “And it turns out Australians are good at handling drivers, they have the right bubbly attitude.” ViaVan – born\u0026nbspout of a merger between Via in the US and Mercedes-Benz Vans in Europe – promotes car-sharing (or “pooling”). “It turns out Londoners are pretty happy sharing,” Oppetit says, “especially if it keeps the price down.” And it’s corner-to-corner rather than door-to-door. “You might have to walk a couple of blocks and they drop you off a block or two away,” but it saves on car journeys and cuts congestion. And the ideal model is a hybrid car or all-electric. Oppetit is even in favour of more cycling in the capital too. She sees bikes and Via as part of the same general eco-friendly tendency. ViaVan is now in four cities in Europe, including Milton Keynes. I used the app and took one of their rides to Euston. I had to wait less than two minutes. One share. The driver, like all drivers everywhere, complained about the traffic.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And it isn’t a big draw for the under 18s in the same way that football is.\u0026nbspHow much will it hurt that sport, which has been the main area of focus, although others are covered too? Football has behaved as a magic money tree ever since the launch of the Premiership, fuelled by the ever escalating size of the broadcast rights deals it has been able to secure.\u0026nbspGambling plays an important, but not central, role in making those rights profitable. The industry’s ads peppered the coverage of the last World Cup on commercial TV\u0026nbspand are heavily featured in internationals.\u0026nbspThey provide\u0026nbsprevenue streams for BT and Sky’s coverage of the Premiership\u0026nbspand European club tournaments too.\u0026nbspLosing them will hurt.

We know that the type of university and qualification can make a difference to earnings later in life – so tackling this inequality of access is vital.“Schools and universities need to work together to ensure that bright, state-educated students have a fair chance at accessing the best higher education opportunities.”The Sutton Trust has not disclosed which eight schools and colleges accounted for the huge number of Oxbridge admissions – a condition of obtaining the data from Ucas.However, it is understood the majority are independent, fee-paying schools, with Eton, Westminster School and St Paul’s School all included on the list.In its report, the charity highlighted practices at some of these schools, which are giving students a leg up on their peers.At Eton, where pupils have access to a dedicated universities officer and the school’s own internal higher education guide, between 60 and 100 boys are sent to Oxford or Cambridge each year.Westminster School offers its students bespoke mentoring and university preparation classes, resulting in around 70 to 80 admissions to Oxbridge each year.gofundme fundraiserSt Paul’s School assigns each of its students a university advisor to guide them through the application process – a move that helped over a quarter of their students gain a place at either Oxford or Cambridge in 2016.In its report, the Sutton Trust called for students from all backgrounds to receive admissions advice to help close the admissions gap between top schools and the rest of the country.“If we are to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have a fair chance of getting in to our top universities, we need to address the patchwork of higher education guidance and support,” the trust’s founder, Sir Peter Lampl said,“All young people, regardless of what area they grow up in, or what school they go to, should have access to high quality personal guidance that allows them to make the best informed choices about their future.“The admissions process also needs to change. We have made the case for giving poorer students a break through contextual admissions, but we also need universities to make it clear what grades these students need to access courses.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man wearing a storm trooper costume holds a sketchbook belonging to costume designer John Mollo, and showing illustrations for Star Wars costumes, during a photo-call ahead of an auction at Bonhams in central LondonDemonstrators for and against Brexit protest opposite the Houses of ParliamentTheresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Zuckerberg agreed to senior executive Justin\u0026nbspOsofsky’s request in 2013 to stop giving friends’ list access to Vine on the day that social media rival Twitter launched the video-sharing service. “We’ve prepared reactive PR,” Mr\u0026nbspOsofsky\u0026nbspwrote, to which Mr Zuckerberg replied: “Yup, go for it.”The documents also raised questions about Facebook’s transparency. An exchange from 2015 shows Facebook leaders discussing how to begin collecting call logs from Android users’ smartphones without subjecting them to “scary” permissions screens.In a summary of the 250-page cache, which includes internal emails involving Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and other members of staff,\u0026nbspDamian\u0026nbspCollins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, highlighted a number of “key issues”.Sandberg asked staff to probe Soros after his attack on tech companiesHe claimed the documents show Facebook chose to “whitelist” selected companies, allowing them to maintain “full access” to the data of a user’s Facebook friends even after the company announced changes in 2015 to end such access.Mr Collins suggested the cache also showed Facebook regularly discussed the value of data on the platform, and said: “The idea of linking access to friends’ data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”He added that the files also showed Facebook knew an update to its Android mobile app that would allow it to collect user call logs would be controversial and “to mitigate any bad PR Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app”.Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

The summary said the site used this data to assess how often people use these apps and then to decide on which companies to acquire and which to treat as a threat.The internal workings of Facebook were revealed after parliament released the internal documents from the controversial company. The files show a range of discussions from inside Facebook, including suggestions that it could one day charge developers for access to its data about users.\u0026nbsp“There’s a big question on where we get the revenue from,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in one email. “Do we make it easy for devs to use our paymentsad network but not require them? Do we require them? Do we just charge a rev share directly and let devs who use them get a credit against what they owe us? It’s not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale.”\u0026nbspThe documents were released as the company is hit by a range of scandals about how Facebook uses the vast array of personal data it collects about its users.Facebook users logged out as site stops working properlyThe documents were released by parliament’s media committee, which is running an investigation into those scandals and Facebook more generally, and are files seized from a now-defunct swimsuit photo searching app as part of that investigation. They show that Facebook deeply considered the issues that would go on to produce a range of scandals, including the Cambridge\u0026nbspAnalytica\u0026nbspaffair.The committee received the documents from app developer\u0026nbspSix4Three, which had acquired the files dating from 2013-2014, as part of a US lawsuit against the social media giant. The app developer is suing Facebook over a change to the social network’s privacy policies in 2015 that led\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspto shut down its app,\u0026nbspPikinis, which let users find photos of their friends in bathing suits by searching their friends list.\u0026nbspUS senator Richard\u0026nbspBlumenthal\u0026nbspdescribed the documents as part of “mounting evidence that Facebook acted chaotically, recklessly and lawlessly by granting access to private consumer data for financial gain”.Facebook responded quickly, saying the release was misleading. “The documents\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspgathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context,” the statement said. “We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers.“Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. But the facts are clear: we’ve never sold people’s data.”The firm said it would relax one “out of date” policy that restricted competitors’ use of its data. Previously, “Mark level signoff” would have been required for an exemption to the policy, according to one document, referring to Mr Zuckerberg.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Award voters have clearly embraced Adam McKay’s Big Short follow-up, featuring an “unrecognisable” Christian Bale as former vice president\u0026nbspDick Cheney, after the first screening that rocked Hollywood a few weeks back. Its placement here – with noms for Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell – establishes the late awards race entrant as a firm frontrunner. Jacob StolworthyPerhaps it’s proof the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) is widening its scope when it comes to the Golden Globes, or simply a testament to how much Ryan Coogler’s blockbuster resonated with audiences, but Black Panther has become the second superhero film ever to receive a Best Picture nomination at the awards. That’s after last year’s rather tongue-in-cheek nomination for Deadpool in the Musical or Comedy category. Of course, that didn’t translate into an Oscar nomination for Ryan Reynold’s antihero, but could the hype behind Black Panther be enough to push to the centre of the awards conversation? Clarisse LoughreyAll hail, Queen Olivia. Unforgivably overlooked for her unflinching turn in Tyrannosaur in 2012, the British actor won a Globe five years later for her role in the spy TV drama The Night Manager. She now gets her first film nod for Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite, which re-imagines the reign of Queen Anne as an absurdist farce with a lesbian twist. Quite right, too. As Queen Anne, she’s brilliantly funny, never missing a beat as she veers wildly between maudlin and child-like wonderment. A lot of the talk will be about Lady Gaga, but, really, this is the performance to cherish the most. Patrick SmithRoma’s not nominated for Best Picture - but don\u0027t worrtConsidering it won Venice Film Festival’s coveted Golden Lion award – the same trophy won by The Shape of Water last year –\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuarón’s masterpiece seemed destined to overcome its foreign-language status to be nominated in the main film category. So why isn\u0027t it there? Well, silly HFPA\u0026nbsprules mean that world cinemas doesn\u0027t qualify for the category. The good news is that\u0026nbspCuarón received recognition as director and screenwriter meaning\u0026nbspRoma’s been nominated for all it could possibly be.\u0026nbspDon\u0027t expect the same thing to happen at the Academy Awards where no such rule exists.\u0026nbspJacob StolworthyFemale directors have been shut out (again)You would think the HFPA would take notice after Natalie Portman cracked a joke about the total lack of female directors nominated at least year’s Golden Globes. Presenting the award for Best Director, she commented: “And here are all the male nominees”. Whoever is chosen to present this year’s award would do well to repeat Portman’s statement: once again, no female director has been nominated in the category, and no film directed by a woman has been nominated for Best Motion Picture. For an awards season that elsewhere looks encouragingly erse, with recognition in the film categories for the likes of Black Panther, If Beale Street Could Talk, BlackKklansman, and Crazy Rich Asians, this feels like an unnecessary embarrassment, especially when Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace were both released this year. Clarisse Loughrey Golden Globes 2019 nominations list in fullIt’s become something of a cliché to insist this every awards season\u0026nbsp– but this year they’re genuinely on the march. Amongst the film nominees, Rachel Weisz (The Favourite), Claire Foy (First Man), and Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) earned supporting actor nods, while Christian Bale (Vice), Emily Blunt (Mary Poppins Returns), Rosamund Pike (A Private War) and Olivia Colman (The Favourite) were recognised for their leading roles. As for TV, Richard Madden, who starred in Jed Mercurio’s phenomenally successful BBC drama Bodyguard, was nominated in the TV drama category, while Benedict Cumberbatch (Patrick Melrose), Hugh Grant (A Very English Scandal) and Thandie Newton (Westworld) were nominated elsewhere. It was a shame not to see Killing Eve’s Jodie Comer nominated alongside her brilliant co-star Sandra Oh, and Florence Pugh was overlooked for her stunning turn in The Little Drummer Girl, but we’re just nit-picking now. Alexandra PollardWidows becomes this award season’s major snubA lot of people will be scanning the nominations list this year, baffled not to find a single nomination for Steve McQueen’s Widows. It’s an electric thriller, which received a huge amount of critical acclaim upon its release, and features one of this year’s most formidable casts. It’s disappointing not only to see the film omitted but also to see the Golden Globes sleep on the always excellent Viola Davis, in what may be one of her finest roles yet. Clarisse LoughreyAt 15, Eighth Grade star Elsie Fisher isn’t quite the youngest lead actress nominee in the Golden Globes’s 74-year history – that honour goes to Beasts of the Southern Wild star Quvenzhané Wallis, who was 9 when she was nominated. If Fisher wins, though, she’ll be the youngest ever winner, surpassing Children of a Lesser God’s Marlee Matlin, who was 21 when she won the award in 1987. Fisher is raw and magnetic as a struggling middle schooler in Bo Burnham’s acclaimed directorial debut, having been cast after Burnham spotted her on YouTube. Alexandra PollardYou can catch up with our live blog running through all the nominations as they were announced belowIt\u0027s not just films being nominated today, of course - the Golden Globes are all about the small box also. Expect to see Killing Eve, Atlanta and Homecoming in contention.Every year, awards season becomes a two-horse race and this one\u0027s no different. Are you Team A Star Is Born or Team Roma? Now\u0027s the time to decide.Obviously Roma is the first true\u0026nbspawards chance for Netflix in the film\u0026nbspcategories. Expect to see Alfonso Cuaron nommed for Best Director too alongside the likes of Spike Lee (BlackKklansman) and Bradders for A Star is Born.As ever, expect no women to be nominated for Best Director, even though Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) and Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) should be given all the trophies.Important-y boring stuff to note - the Globes are split into two categories: drama and musicalcomedy but for some reason, the quite-clearly-a-musical A Star Is Born is competing in the... drama category. Makes sense, huh?The Favourite, Crazy Rich Asians, Green Book and Vice, which stars an unrecognisable Christian Bale as Dick Cheney, to name but a few.I\u0027m just keeping my fingers crossed for film of the year,\u0026nbspGAME NIGHT.Even though it\u0027s not out for a few weeks, Mary Poppins Returns has most likely been seen by nostalgic\u0026nbspaward\u0026nbspvoters so a nomination is a sure bet.The big question is: will Queen film Bohemian Rhapsody get a nod? (Most) critics didn\u0027t like it, audiences loved it, yadda yadda. Time will tell.If it\u0027s going to get anything, it\u0027s for Freddie Mercury star Rami Malek who\u0027ll face competition from the aforementioned Bale, Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali (both for Green Book) and Robert Redford for *his last screen role*\u0026nbspThe Old Man and the Gun.Actress-wise, it looks like Olivia Colman\u0027s to lose\u0026nbspwho is long overdue international awards success tbh.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

The inclusion of\u0026nbspBlack Panther\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspPose, two works of important cultural significance, were\u0026nbspsaluted – and rightfully so.Some, however, lamented the exclusion of works such as Steve McQueen\u0027s\u0026nbspWidows, as well as TV shows\u0026nbspAtlanta\u0026nbspand Maniac,\u0026nbspfrom the list.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHere are 10 of the most significant snubs from this year\u0027s Golden Globes nominations:Golden Globes 2019 nominations list in fullNetflix\u0027s\u0026nbspcomedy-drama released its fifth season to universal acclaim, in keeping with its four previous instalments.While it has consistently performed well, the bitterly funny series has yet to score its first Golden Globe nomination.The season five episode\u0026nbspFree\u0026nbspChurro, which consisted only in a monologue by Will\u0026nbspArtnett, gave the impression that the show\u0027s writers were clearly reaching for some recognition this award season – but\u0026nbspBoJack\u0026nbspHorseman\u0026nbspwill have to wait a little longer to make its Golden Globe debut.Ironically, the title character won his own Golden Globe as part of a story line as early as season one.McQueen\u0027s thriller had the critical acclaim and the star-studded cast fit to land a spot on this year\u0027s list of nominees.Yet\u0026nbspit wasn\u0027t nominated in a single category – a choice that fails to recognise Viola Davis\u0027s performance as Veronica Rawlings.The Oscar-winning actor won her first Golden Globe in 2017 for\u0026nbspFences. Her role in\u0026nbspWidows\u0026nbsphas been deemed powerful and Oscar-worthy.Jane the VirginWhen it debuted in 2014,\u0026nbspJane the Virgin\u0026nbspwas seen mainly as a quirky show with a unique premise: a 20-something virgin gets artificially inseminated with her boss\u0027s sperm due to a medical error, thus ending up pregnant with his baby – in a modernised case of immaculate conception.Since then,\u0026nbspJane the Virgin\u0026nbsphas proven to be an important show – the kind that has brought several Latinx performers, including lead actor Gina Rodriguez, into the spotlight, while tackling important subjects such as abortion and immigration. On top of that, the series has managed to both spoof and pay tribute to the world of telenovelas.The show has scored multiple Golden Globe nominations in the past, and Rodriguez won the award for Best Actress in a TV series or comedy during the January 2015 ceremony.Still,\u0026nbspJane the Virgin\u0026nbspdelivered a well received fourth season, as pointed out by The\u0026nbspNew Yorker\u0026nbspTV critic Emily Nussbaum, and it would have been fair to see that consistency rewarded.Donald Glover is nominated in the\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actor in a Television Series –\u0026nbspMusical or Comedy category\u0026nbspfor his role in the\u0026nbspFX\u0026nbspseries, which he also created.The show itself won the\u0026nbspBest Television Series – Musical or Comedy title last year, and Glover was awarded the\u0026nbspBest Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy distinction.With a universally acclaimed second season,\u0026nbspAtlanta\u0026nbspdeserved a renewed nomination in the Best Television Series category.The rest of the cast, including Bryan Tyree Henry, Zazie\u0026nbspBeetz, and Lakeith Stanfield, was also deserving of recognition.Glenn Close scored a nomination for her role in\u0026nbspBjörn Runge\u0027s movie based on Meg Wolitzer\u0027s novel of the same name – as should she.But the movie itself – a touching, profoundly upsetting drama that manages to feel relatable despite being set in the realm of the Nobel Prize in Literature – deserved a spot of its own on the shortlist.Max Irons, who plays an eager son whose biggest personal tragedy is to be a good writer born to a great one, could have conceivably landed in the Best Supporting Actor category.Thandie\u0026nbspNewton is the only\u0026nbspWestworld\u0026nbspperformer to have been nominated for a Golden Globe this year, for her impactful\u0026nbspperformance as\u0026nbspMaeve Millay.The fact that\u0026nbspWestworld, which earned three nominations last year, was largely excluded from this year\u0027s shortlist feels less like a snub than an acknowledgement of the show\u0027s decreasing quality.While its second season has received favourable reviews, many have deemed the increasingly intricate plot not satisfying enough – and filled with too many questions while failing to deliver answers.\u0026nbspWestworld: ‘This Is the End’ season finale - trailerYes,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbsplanded five nominations. But some wish that its director, the Greek filmmaker previously at the helm of\u0026nbspThe Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster, had been shortlisted in the Best Director category.Colin Farrell was nominated in 2016\u0026nbspfor his role in\u0026nbspThe Lobster\u0026nbspas Best Actor,\u0026nbspbut Lanthimos\u0026nbsphimself has yet to score a Golden Globe nomination in his own name.With a star-studded cast led by Emma Stone, Jonah Hill, and Justin Theroux, Maniac\u0026nbspseemed to be one of Netflix\u0027s bets for this award season.Yet, the psychological comedy-drama, which has received positive reviews, failed to score a single spot on this year\u0027s list.The\u0026nbspadaptation of Angie Thomas\u0027s immensely successful novel of the same name – which has spent 92 weeks on\u0026nbspThe New York Times\u0027s Young Adult Hardcover best-sellers list – has generated some Oscar chatter.In a story line inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, it tells the story of Starr Carter, a black teenager whose friend Khalil is shot and killed by a while police officer.The film has earned rave reviews and is one of the frontrunners of this awards season, so its absence from the Golden Globes shortlist is noteworthy.Mary Queen of ScotsThe historical drama starring Saoirse Ronan as Mary, Queen of Scots and Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth I seemed a shoe-in for this year\u0027s list,\u0026nbspyet\u0026nbspit failed to score a single nomination.It opened in the US around the same time as\u0026nbspThe Favourite, another queen-centred historical drama – and apparently there was only room for one of those on this year\u0027s shortlist.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Huawei has a robust cyber security assurance system and a proven track record.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our technical teams are investigating.We apologise for any inconvenience. Updates will be shared here as soon they are available.A similar explanation was tweeted by O2\u0027s official account.We are aware our customers are unable to use data this morning, it posted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working on the issue with high priority. We are really sorry and working as hard and as fast as we can to fix this.It then posted a follow-up explaining the problem.Outage Update: One of our 3rd party suppliers has identified a software issue in their system, it tweeted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working extremely hard to resolve this. We\u0027d encourage you to use Wi-Fi wherever you can and we are really sorry.If you have been hit by the issues, there may be\u0026nbsplittle you can do. But here are some things to try in the meantime.While many people switch to GiffGaff or O2 for the deals, it is far from the most reliable of the data networks.According to Which, EE has the most reliable 4G, with people being able to get faster connections 87 per cent of the time. It also has faster mobile web connections than O2, according to the same survey.WiFi\u0026nbspconnections are still working, which might be little consolation if you\u0027re already out and trying to connect to the internet.But it is worth trying to see if you can get online using one: remember, for instance, you can get online at Tube stations by using their WiFi connections, and there might be open networks available if you are near a business. O2 customers may even have access to BT Openzone, which borrows people\u0027s in-home WiFi connections to allow you to get onto the internet.Once you\u0027re at work, you might also find there\u0027s a WiFi connection for employees that you\u0027ve never had to use because you can usually\u0026nbspget data. Now that you can\u0027t get data, it might be helpful to use that instead.When you\u0027re trying to fix your own data, there\u0027s not a great deal you can do. Sometimes, switching the connection on and off sometimes fixes problems like these – but isn\u0027t working this time around.Instead, you might just have to stay glued to The Independent\u0027s coverage for notification of when the network gets back up again.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That makes life challenging for us.OnePlus aims to go mainstream as it launches its ‘iPhone killer’“5G is going to open up a lot of new ways people use their smartphone – the increased speed combined with the increased capacity mean your smartphone can now truly be the centre of a connected experience, for everything from fitness to home automation.”The announcement that OnePlus’s\u0026nbspphone will be the first available in Europe comes despite the fact that other manufacturers – including giants like Samsung – have promised to bring their own devices to the network as soon as possible.Asked whether he was concerned that rivals would beat OnePlus to market despite its claim to being the first, Mr Lau said that there are “obviously no guarantees” but that his company were best positioned to be ready with the cutting-edge technology first.“We started working on 5G in 2016, and developed an R\u0026ampD lab with Qualcomm in 2017,” he said. “OnePlus has always used Qualcomm 800 series chipsets as part of our flagship-only strategy, and this is part of the reason for the excellent relationship we have with one of the world’s leading chipset providers.“No-one is better positioned than OnePlus to take the lead with 5G. We don’t really look at what others are doing in the industry, we’re focused on providing the best possible experience for our users, and we recognised early on that 5G would be a huge opportunity for revolution.”Others, such as Apple, are rumoured to have sat out the decision until at least 2020, allowing other companies to take the first leap – and deal with the potential for the kinds of major infrastructure problems that have blighted similar rollouts in the past.

Those early adopters know that, as with the launch of 4G, there won’t be 5G coverage everywhere at first but it’ll be a rapid rollout from networks.”Proponents have regularly suggested that 5G could change the way that people use phones, allowing people to take advantage of instant and reliable connections to create new forms of experience. Mr\u0026nbspLau\u0026nbspechoed those claims,\u0026nbspsuggesting they may be transformative in ways that the company has not even expected.“When you look at the history of smartphones, they’re used in ways today which no-one had designed them for originally,” he said.\u0026nbsp”5G will be the same – the possibilities will open up in front of us as people experiment with how to combine speed and capacity – everything from gaming through to work or fitness will change.

Previously experts have suggested\u0026nbspthe new arrivals brought the plague with them, wiping out the farmers as the disease moved with its hosts.Russian Black Death victims reveal plague spread earlier than thoughtHowever, the new strain discovered in Sweden appears to have emerged around 5,700 years ago, before these migrations began.This suggests\u0026nbspthe disease swept the continent earlier, after evolving in the cramped confines of the “mega settlements” of 10,000-20,000 inhabitants that were being built at this time.These mega-settlements were the largest settlements in Europe at that time, 10 times bigger than anything else,” said Dr Simon Rasmussen, a genomics researcher at the Technical University of Denmark.“They had people, animals, and stored food close together, and, likely, very poor sanitation.

If plague evolved in the mega-settlements, then when people started dying from it, the settlements would have been abandoned and destroyed.”As the plague evolved, it would have spread around the continent along newly developed trade routes made possible by wheeled transport.\u0026nbspUltimately, it would have arrived in the northernmost parts of Europe, and the small village in which the woman sampled by this study lived.The plague has devastated Europe for millennia, from outbreaks in the Bronze Age through to the Black Death pandemic that killed up to 60 per cent of the continent’s population in the Middle Ages.Dr Rasmussen and his team are trying to track down the\u0026nbspearliest strains of plague to emerge, using ancient DNA strands to trace its lineage from the relatively harmless bacteria that preceded it.The strain still in existence today erged from other varieties around 5,000 years ago, and the 5,700-year-old specimen is likely a closer representation of those implicated in the first outbreaks.Though Dr Rasmussen says they are yet to find a “smoking gun” for their theory about early mega-settlement outbreaks, they would like to test remains from those sites in order to test the idea.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

US President Donald Trump threatened to send the military to close its southern border if Mexico fails to stem the onslaught of migrants from Central America, in a series of tweets that blamed Democrats ahead of the midterm electionsIslamabad says the United States never notified it of the daring nighttime raid in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad - just a few miles from Pakistan\u0027s top military academy - in advance and that the mission that nabbed bin Laden invaded its sovereignty.Many believe the sweeping crackdown on aid groups is the fallout from the CIA sting operation in which Pakistani doctor Shakeel Afridi, posing as an international aid worker, used a fake hepatitis vaccination program to try to get DNA samples from bin Laden\u0027s family as a means of pinpointing his location.Afridi was subsequently arrested and remains in jail in northwestern Pakistan. Washington has repeatedly demanded his release.The crackdown simply marks the latest chapter in an ongoing effort to push back against foreign NGOs in Pakistan, said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programs at the Washington-based Wilson Centre.It\u0027s hard to overstate the significance of the hunt for bin Laden and the impact it had on Pakistani perceptions of foreign NGOs.Mr Hasan said the 18 expelled groups, with the exception of two that are still in court trying to overturn their ouster, have closed their operations in Pakistan. The groups provided everything from education to health care to sanitary and clean water facilities, he said. Many worked in partnership with provincial governments, often supplementing meager development budgets.Now local officials are being told not to work with these groups, added Mr\u0026nbspHasan. Government people up front will tell you they see the value of their work, but the decision has been taken.Military spokesman General\u0026nbspAsif Ghafoor denies any link between the closures of aid groups and the bin Laden operation, insisting they simply did not meet the criteria, though many had operated for decades in Pakistan.Among the US-based organisations are World Vision, Plan International and Catholic Relief Services.Pakistan has cracked down on dissidents in recent months and its numerous television channels and newspapers have faced increasing censorship, which has been criticised by international as well as national media watchdogs.Civil society space has shrunk, said Mr\u0026nbspHasan. Next, they will go after local organisations who receive international funding.It will seriously compromise the independence of organisations, their flexibility of how to operate, where to operate.These crackdowns on charities will deliver another blow to Pakistan\u0027s image, said Mr Kugelman. While Pakistan certainly isn\u0027t the only country to be curtailing the activities of charitable groups, the reputational impacts could be particularly strong because it has a preexisting image problem.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448071602.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit rollout december latest","story":"These are the last places the new flagship programme is coming to - and it will now will be in every job centre in the country for new claims.You only need to be aware of thisyoure making a new claim for benefits -you’re already on them then you don’t need to apply or swap unless you’re told to.Once this rollout is complete the DWP will start transferring people over onto UC starting from next year.Around , are set to be moved across first, and they will get help with making a new claim.But the new Universal Credit systems rollout has been far from smooth - with many Brits claiming its pushing them into debt.One single mum told us how she was at risk of losing her home after applying for Universal Credit - because she couldnt claim help with her mortgage debt.And yesterday another Brit said she couldnt even afford a loaf of bread while she waited for her payment to come through.There could be up to , new claims across December - the average for October, according to the DWP, was , a week.And housing association Peabody warned that , kids could get their Christmas ruined by the wait for benefits.If your Jobcentre area is not on the list then enter your postcode here to find out when it’s coming to near you.Most people will need a bank account to receive benefits - or a similar account with a credit union or building society.You need to be able to receive payments and set up direct debits and standing orders with it too.If you’re living with your partner and you’re both eligible for Universal Credit, you’ll get a joint payment - so you might want to consider a joint account too.The new Universal Credit system is mainly online, though you can get help in the job centre and over the phone too.Most Jobcentres and libraries have computers and free wi-fi you can useyou can’t get online.Andyou’re using it from home on a budget, make sure you shop around using services like U-switch to get the best internet deal too.Drawing up a budget of all your household incomes and outgoings will be helpful before you make a claim for Universal Credit.UC will be paid to you in one monthly payment for the six benefits, but in some extreme circumstances you can ask for it to be paid fortnightly or even weekly.Consider how much you get or expect to get in benefits, work and other income, and when in the month they come in to try and help you budget.And youll need to know information about your existing savings and pensions.Before you apply you should also work out your outgoings on everything from rent, food and travel, to electricity, gas, phone bills, and paying off debts.You can use a benefits calculator here to give you an estimate of what you could get.Bear in mind theres a cap on the total amount of benefits that most people can get - some benefits are included in the cap but others are not.Youll also need some form of ID to prove who you are - it can be a passport or driving licence, but they also will accept things like debit or credit cards too.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one.If youre already on benefits, you dont need to apply for Universal Credit unless your circumstances change or youre told to by the DWP.They work it out by looking at how much you earned in the last assessment period - so anything you earn after you start a claim will count towards your income levels and could affect the amount of benefits youll get.You can earn a certain amount under Universal Credit butyou earn more than the allowances then your benefits will be reduced.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children.

You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why the apparent change of heart The popular consensus seems to be it’s a charm offensive to counteract the negative coverage of an alleged rt between her daughter Kate and royal newbie Meghan Markle — a laying out of the “Team Catherine” stall,you like.But as the fallout rumours are fairly recent and most glossy mags are laid out six weeks in advance, may I humbly cynicallysuggest that the stall she’s laying out might be more monetary than motherly In other words, building up traffic to her and husband Michael’s Party Pieces website for Christmas in preparation for potentially flogging it off to an overseas billionaire in the pre-Brexit New Year.But I digress. On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable. But just like Kate did, it’s far better to quietly earn respect not noisily demand it.SUN writer Lynsey Clarke had the, er, pleasure of reporting on the opening night of Magic Mike Live at London’s Hippodrome casino.Thankfully, I was washing my hair that evening.For the show involves, horror of horrors, “audience participation”.  Not me, no sir-ee.Years ago, a friend booked a surprise stripper to turn up midway through my birthday dinner at a restaurant.But I clocked him the second he walked in, legged it out through the kitchens and refused tountil he’d safely vacated the premises.SHORTLY after Brit John Drennan proposed to Daniella Anthony during their trip to New York, the ring fell off her finger and into a drain.Their effort to retrieve the sparklerwas picked up on CCTV and went viral.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are. It’s the job of the new ­generation to invent and support a digital morality.What’s the point being a ­liberated, gay-friendly, vegan-conscious, no-ing snowflakeyou’re not willing to call out callous voyeurs and smartphone sneaks Libby Purves is a former presenter of Radio ’s Today programme.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ex-soldier Leanne Maguire began to feel ill on day three of a two-week holiday in Mexico and spent the rest of it in bed. When she got home doctors diagnosed viral gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning, said Leanne, . She was later rushed to intensive care, put in a medically induced coma for a week and her family were warned she could die. On awaking, she said, medics revealed that the bug had given her septicaemia, e-Coli and pneumonia as well as liver, lung and kidney failure.   Leanne, who spent nearly two months in hospital, began legal action against travel giant Thomas Cook, which finally settled out of court after five years – just before the case was to be heard. The accounts supervisor, who has a -year-old son Rhys, said: “I could not grasp how a bout of food poisoning led me to death’s door. Then I realised how nasty this condition can be. “I lost more than st in weight and lots of my hair due to malnutrition. “Also I had to take half a year off work and needed counselling to get my le back on track. I looked so dferent that I found it dficult to accept myself.”   Her nightmare started when she booked a pound, holiday at the Temptation Cancun Resort in August . “I spent two weeks in severe pain and kept being violently sick everywhere,” said Leanne, of Runcorn, Cheshire. “My holiday was completely ruined and a waste of money.” After flying back to Britain she was admitted to Warrington Hospital for five days of tests. She said that after the food poisoning diagnosis she was sent home with painkillers – but had towhen her urine turned black and even drinking water made her vomit. Following a three-week stay then five days at home she was admitted to hospital for a third time after her partner dialled . This time she went to intensive care.   “At that point I thought my body was about to shut down completely as I couldn’t feel anything,” said Leanne. Despite her recovery, tests revealed she now has coeliac disease – meaning she cannot eat products containing gluten. In December  she appointed a no-win-no-fee solicitor, who launched a case against Thomas Cook for pound, compensation – claiming the hotel food caused her condition. Her case was set for Chester County Court last October but the company’s settlement offer arrived with days to go. Leanne said: “I was delighted when they finally admitted liability after putting me through five years of hell.” Thomas Cook said: “Customer well-being is always our priority. We’re very sorry Ms Maguire was ill at the resort. “This was a complex case. Medical evidence and time were needed to determine the appropriate level of damages.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents reveal biggest lies tell","story":"NewsParents reveal biggest lies they tell to keep Christmas magic alive for kidsFour in  households have already posted their kids Christmas lists to the North Pole for Santa to seeShareByMirror :,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video thorntons-presents-the-cheeky-elf-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree quarters of parents tell white ‘lies’ over the festive period to keep the magic of Christmas alive, according to research. Researchers who polled , mums and dads of kids aged up to  found they’ll go to great s to capture the imagination of their little ones over the festive period. Four in  have already posted their children’s Christmas lists to the North Pole and a quarter of households are currently home to an elf on the shelf - and his mysterious mishaps. Children in  per cent of homes are likely to rise on Christmas morning to find a bite has been taken out of Santa’s mince pie and a fth will find his footprints in fake snow.  Commissioned by Thorntons to celebrate the launch of its new mischievous Cheeky Elf chocolate model, the research also found  per cent of parents track Santa’s whereabouts using an app. Ian Tweedale, marketing director of Thorntons, said: “It’s lovely to find out the s mums and dads go to pass the love on and help their children embrace the festive period. “Perhaps they remember how special Christmas was for them when they were little, and they want their kids to feel that way for as long as possible.”  The research also found mums and dads will tell eight white ‘lies’ over Yuletide in total. Other s they go to include installing hidden cameras to ‘catch’ Father Christmas delivering presents and tucking into treats left out for him. One in  cheeky parents even tell their kids Santa prefers beer and chocolate to mince pies and milk. Some will keep their kids in check by telling them their elf on the shelf is watching them - and ensuring Santa is kept full briefed on their behaviour.  In years gone by,  per cent have told their children brussels sprouts make you big and strong. Many of those polled will create winter wonderlands at home complete with nativity scenes, miniature sleighs, illuminated figurines, fake snow and icicles. The research also found hiding gts from eagle-eyed little ones is one of the biggest seasonal headaches. For seven per cent of those polled, the problem is so signicant they have even installed ‘smart cameras’ to catch in the act of looking for their presents. More than a fth have resorted to parents hiding presents in the loft,  per cent have stored them at their own parent’s homes and a third of snuck them away on top of the wardrobe.  Eighty-six per cent feel it is important to keep the magic of Christmas alive for their children. And many rely on others to make sure this is in the case –  per cent enlist their kid’s grandparents and  per cent somewhat depend on their children’s auntie and uncle.

The marking on the Svinesund Bridge shows the border between Norway and Sweden. And the UK effectively has one foot out of the EU now too – but where it is heading is far from clear. With Theresa May’s Brexit plans at risk of defeat in next week’s vote, all eyes are on what comes next. The two extreme options – a no-deal Brexit or a second referendum – would be highly isive.   But one gaining support is following Norway’s lead, so we visited to see what it might mean. Norway is a big export market for British goods and supplies % of our gas. The Norway option can seem complicated but would essentially mean us being part of the European Economic Area through the European Free Trade Association. The EEA is made up of all EU countries, plus three EFTA states: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. All EEA members have full single market access and with it accept the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Under the Norway option, the post-Brexit UK would join EFTA and a big plus is that the EU seems up for the idea. Other EFTA shycountries also seem keen, while not discussing it formally.   Norway’s trade minister, Torbjorn Roe Isaksen, said: “Our goal always is to maintain as much of a well-ing, no-hassle relationship with the UK as possible.” Yet he admitted Norway’s set-up was not ideal – and Prime Minister Erna Solberg recently warned we would lose trade “bargaining power” outside the EU. “The main advantage is we have full single market access,” said Mr Isaksen. “The disadvantage is we are part of so much EU regulation but don’t have a seat at the table.” This switch to being a “rule taker” is concerning for those who fear its impact on our financial sector. However, it is estimated EFTA countries have to abide by % of EU rules and are not bound by the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. Norway claims by controlling its own waters, it better manages fish stock levels. But the EU charges import duties.   Another criticism is Norway has to pay into the EU budget – pound per head, compared with pound for us as a full member. The Norway route could cut our bill % to %, depending on who you believe. Another big issue for critics of the option is freedom of workers. Supporters say the EEA Treaty has opt-outs that could limit EU immigration. And one argument for ditching the EU is escaping the European Court of Justice, as disputes could be dealt with by an EFTA Court. But EFTA members are not part of the Customs Union, meaning border checks. Norway says it uses technology to avoid long hold-ups. When we crossed the border by car, we had no checks. But holding areas contained large numbers of lorries.   Doing these at a busy port like Dover could be a big headache, which is one reason why some argue for a “Norway for now” route until we shynegotiate a long-term trade deal with Brussels. But any resolution would need to address the key issue of the Irish border, which is why ministers are talking about Norway Plus, which involves staying in the customs union. Staying in the single market would mean firms retain free access to the EU, which makes up % of our exports. We would not benefit from the EU’s trading bloc clout but could – unless we opted for the customs union in addition – strike new deals with countries like India. The ultimate truth is the Norway option will keep neither Remainers nor Brexiteers happy. Former Labour PM Tony Blair said: “Norway’s not going to work. It’s going to be subject to an even greater degree of attack from people who voted Brexit. It’s very hard to look at that Brexit vote and say they mandated Norway.” Norway voted against EU membership and people we spoke to in fishing port Alesund backed us getting out. Waitress Khawla Al-Sahli said: “We feel we are fine the way we are.”   Taxi driver Borre Haljelsvik said: “Together the UK and Norway would be better at standing up to the EU.” And Professor Carl Baudenbacher, a former president of the EFTA Court, said: “If you compare Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EEA, you are better off with the EEA.” The Bank of England rates the Norway option one of the best and it may have enough support for us to avoid a no-deal exit. It must therefore be taken seriously.

A Mirror investigation reveals the UK has lost , grass pitches, swimming pools, sports halls and athletic tracks during the past two years of austerity. It comes as a Sport England report yesterday revealed . million children and young people – .% – do less than  minutes of physical activity a day. And NHS figures showed the proportion who are severely obese has gone up by more than a third since . Commonwealth gold medal winner Conrad Williams, , said: “People talk about an Olympic legacy, but it is six years later and we are already cutting off people from joining the conveyor belt that leads to big success.”   Figures discovered by the Labour Party revealed England has been stripped of  swimming pools at a time when nearly half of -year-olds leave primary school unable to swim. Some  inidual sports halls,  athletic tracks and  grass pitches have been scrapped. Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the stats “cast a truly dark cloud over how seriously the Government takes fitness and well-being”. Sprinter Conrad, who won gold with England in the xm at Glasgow , fears closures will deprive the UK of the next generation of athletic stars. He trains teenage runners at Crystal Palace Arena in South East London, which is currently at risk. The arena, the home of British athletics until the Olympic stadium opened, was where Conrad used to train – and he is campaigning to save it.   He said: “If we don’t have facilities which are open and near people, then we are not going to see success and we’re going to lose our reputation as a great sporting nation.” The former European m shychampion also said closures made sports like athletics harder for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into. He said: “There is so much talent in this country in the inner cities and in deprived areas. Butthey don’t have places near then to train, or see people who are like them achieving success, then they won’t get involved.” Not only are kids more likely to be obese than ever before, but just one in  are getting their daily recommended exercise, a study by the universities of Exeter and Plymouth found.   Experts studied  year five children from  schools in Devon and discovered one in  children in their last year of primary school is so severely overweight they are considered obese. The number of children being treated for Type  diabetes is  times larger than previously thought, the study said. The UK has lost , grass pitches, swimming pools, inidual sports halls and athletic tracks since  and gained just , – a net loss of ,. They include Sansome Walk swimming pool in Worcester, which closed in , bringing an end to more than  years of swimming at the site.   Other facilities under threat include Pontllanfraith and Cefn Fforest leisure centres in Caerphilly, South Wales. Hundreds of locals campaigning to save them were joined by ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock as they took to the streets. Dad-of-four Dean Jones, of Pontllanfraith, said: “This is about quality of le for my kids – they get exercise and they are getting to be part of a team. “We can’t seem to get the importance of that over to the council. It doesn’t seem to matter about the consequences for their health. “Keeping these centres open doesn’t cost that much compared to the massive benefit it has for our children - I don’t know why politicians don’t get that.” In Somerset, eight swimming pools are going to be transferred to nearby schools to cut out the cost of paying a company to manage them. And in Pendle, Lancs, the council is reviewing its support for leisure centres in Barnoldswick, Colne and Nelson. Labour says the lack of facilities makes it especially dficult for the less well-off to get the exercise which doctors agree is essential to a healthy lestyle. It blamed the Government for slashing funding for councils, which own many of the pools and playing fields, by % since .   Cash-strapped town halls are having to take tough decisions when it comes to leisure facilities, with many handing them to private companies to push the cost off their books. Dr Allin-Khan said: “We know the positive impact good fitness levels have on physical and mental health, but the Government have not listened to the experts. The Olympic legacy is in tatters – there is no way for ministers to get away from this. “Hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in local sports facilities are being ruined by cuts to local authorities. “While some members of the public can afford expensive gym memberships and access to private adventure parks, these perks are often financially out of reach for the most vulnerable in society.” The Government insists many of the grass pitches have been replaced by more modern all-weather articial grass pitches –  of which have been opened between  and . A Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said: “We are completely committed to helping people get active and are investing poundbillion in grassroots sport. “Since , Sport England has also invested poundmillion to help build new state-of-the-art health and leisure shyfacilities across the country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners want pogues fairytale new","story":"NewsCampaigners want Pogues Fairytale of New York CENSORED over homophobic lyricA student assistant editor and a radio DJ are among those who feel the line \"you cheap lousy faggot\" should be edited outShareCommentsByCheryl McEvoy:,  DEC NewsKirsty MacColl and Shane MacGowan collaborated on the classic tune in  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCampaigners want the word faggot banned from the Christmas classic Fairytale of New York.

Tony Martin, a farmer from Norfolk, was convicted of murder in August  after shooting burglar Fred Barras, , dead in his home. He later had his sentence reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. His former mansion and farm outbuildings, which stand together on a plot of land in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, appear to have remained empty for many years.   The -year-old now lives at a dferent secret address. The clip follows YouTuber Abandoned World Explorer UK as he makes his way around the eerie house whilst on holiday with a few friends in June.His video gives a tour around the property showing the house covered in overgrown plants and grass. Walking around the abandoned house, the explorer stumble across piles of unidentied bones lying around in the bathroom. As they continue upstairs, they discover a room with animal bones hanging from the ceiling on pieces of string.   Its not clear how the bones got on the pieces of string but there were another pile of bones on the floor beneath them.Footage shows how cars were left to rot in a damp garage and other farm vehicles are left abandoned in high grass. The explorer said: We spotted the house whilst on holiday and decided to explore it without realising whose house it was. The bones around the place made the house seem like it was something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  They were hung up like decorations and looking like a spider web. I dont think I will be going back, I felt so intimidated and scared whist we were there. To me the most interesting thing I saw was the classic MK Range Rover in the garage and the hanging bones.

Martin blasted them three times with an illegal pump action shot gun.   Both fled through a window but Barras died on the grounds of the now abandoned mansion.

Former pound-an-hour escort mum Elizabeth Wilkins, , fractured her babys skull and broke his ribs by shaking him and banging his head, a court heard. She was convicted by a jury after a four week trial of assaulting her defenceless newborn son in rage and frustration. Judge Peter Johnson launched a scathing attack at the former law student for her lack of remorse. He said: I find you manipulative and devious and you had only your best interests at heart. The insidious suggestion that Erick was responsible for shaking your son I find despicable.   You deprived him of contact with his father and gave lie after lie to save your own skin. There was just one possible perpetrator - you. The trial heard the child, just three months old, suffered brain damage two years ago and may have developmental problems when he grows up. Wilkins, who had been studying law at university, tried to sht the blame on her former partner and co-defendant -year-old Erick Vanselow. But he was acquitted of all offences after they both went on trial at Plymouth Crown Court in September. Wilkins, who revealed during the trial she sold sex as an escort to pay for therapy to try and get her son back, was released on bail as an act of mercy but was today jailed for seven years.   Judge Johnson said: You say you are sorry about what has happened but this is in the context of saying you did not harm him. There is not one jot of remorse about what you have done. You maintain you are innocent - you are not. You claim you took a lie detector test and passed but the court also has a lie detector test - it is the jury - and you failed. This was not just one assault, it was two. The judge said the first assault happened when Wilkins squeezed her son in the chest and caused bloodshot eyes. The second assault left the tot with a fractured skull that nearly killed him after Wilkins struck his head with severe blow or hit his head against a hard object. The judge added: The skull fracture left him with likely permanent developmental impairment.   Wilkins, of Plymouth, Devon, was found guilty by a jury on one count of assaulting the baby with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September , . She was also found guilty of assaulting the baby causing actual bodily harm between August  and September . This charge relates to his bloodshot eyes. Assault charges against Vanselow were dropped by the prosecution during the trial and he was also found not guilty of allowing the child to suffer serious physical harm. A probation officer and psychiatrist have written reports to try and explain why she attacked her only child - although she has always denied any wrongdoing and the sentencing hearing heard how she still maintained her innocence.   The judge told her: You are an intelligent, articulate and determined woman who had a very hard start in le. But you obtained a place to study law at university. It was while studying there that you met Erick and you fell pregnant. This was planned on your part to maintain a relationship with him. Your son was born in early July. You felt the baby was displacing you in Ericks affections. But your plan backfired. Wilkins, originally from Weston Super-Mare, Somerset, sat in the dock emotionless while the judge delivered sentence. Her defence barrister Piers Norsworthy said that despite the sentence his client still protested her innocence. He added: There are those that maintain their innocence after the verdict.Many who are in fact guilty but there are others who maintain their innocence and years or decades later are proven to be innocent. Whatever the position here, she maintains her innocence.   Putting that to one side, she is of course anxious of a period of custody of any . She has not experienced it before. She was assaulted outside this building during the trial. There have been threats of violence and death towards her in a number of ways.A photo of her has already been sent to the prison where she is expected to go.They will target her and her time in prison will not be a comfortable one. Someone who has been convicted of offences of this nature will find their time even more dficult. Mr Norsworthy told the judge how Wilkins had had suffered a large degree of trauma from her childhood living with an abusive mother, who she ran away from at the age of . Despite this he said she had worked hard to try and address her issues and was extremely bright and had gone on to study for a law degree at Plymouth University. Mr Norsworthy said she was still suffering moderate depressive disorder around the time of the offences. He added: She does not pose a risk of harm to the public. She is more a danger of harming herself. He said that baby was well-looked after and well-loved by Wilkins and added: Despite what the jury convicted her of it was clear she truly and deeply loved him. She said that until the verdict she had continued to see her son on a regular basis but had not had any contact with him since.

Karolina Valantiniene also hugged her daughter Viktorija Sokolova in bed at their home in Wolverhampton, on the evening of April , before she went off to sleep. The next day, she got up to get ready for work as an early sht as a packer in a factory, where checked on the sleeping -year-old before leaving. But this was the final time she saw the teenager alive, a court heard.A -year-old boy is on trial accused of rape, murder and sexual penetration of a corpse, after the youngsters body was discovered partially-clothed by a dog walker on April .   Jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court had previously heard the schoolgirl had been subjected to what a prosecutor described as horric levels of violence. It is alleged the youth, who cannot be named because of his age, used a hammer-like weapon to fracture the victims skull in a pavilion known as the black house, before sexually assaulting her body. The Crowns case is that he used Facebook messenger to arrange to meet the youngster, in the citys West Park, and changed his trousers before leaving the scene. Giving evidence for the first time on Thursday, the victims mother told the court her daughter had at one stage been sent to live with her natural father after repeatedly running away from the family home in Mostyn Street.   On the Sunday before she was killed, the girl disappeared again, so Mrs Valantiniene went looking for and found her in a park. She found her, later that night, in a childrens play area with her a former boyfriend and another girl, smoking cannabis. When she asked her daughter to come home, the teenager started to shout and scratch and became violent, she told the court. She managed to elude her mother, but was picked up by the police the next day and placed in a childrens home overnight. On Tuesday, April , she was brought back to the family home by a social worker, who advised Mrs Valantiniene and Viktorijas stepfather to try and communicate with the girl.   Mrs Valantiniene, describing the last contact she had with her daughter, said: We were about to go to sleep. I came to her room, gave her a hug, and kissed her for the last time. As she left for work at am, on April , she added: I came to see Viktorija before I left. There was no more contact between the pair, and after work that evening, when her daughter failed to come home, she called the police and reported her missing. She and her husband, Saidas Valantinas, went to bed and the next morning checked their daughters bed to find she had not ed. Mrs Valantiniene said it would have been impossible for her daughter to sneak back into the home undetected, as the couple had a burglar alarm and a dead bolt on the inside of the front door.   She later told the jury that following a patch of bad behaviour from her daughter, beginning in summer  when she started hanging around with older Eastern European males, she was sent away. Viktorija went to Ireland to live with her natural father in late December , ing to Wolverhampton in February . The move followed an incident on December , when Viktorija had gone missing once again, when one of the windows was smashed at the family home. In a phone call to  police call handler that day, Mrs Valantiniene said: I am scared in my own house, you understand. I have a very big problem with my daughter.

But fortunately, the surgery was a success.Little Alexander and Harris managed to reach  weeks and, despite being born prematurely just five days later, are now adorable tots. Their parents, from Surrey, have shared their story ahead of World TTTSAwareness Day tomorrow.They are warning parents of identical twins not to be afraid to challenge the care being giventhey suspect the le-threatening condition.“Dont be afraid to speak up about the care, especiallyit falls below the standards set out by NICE and Tamba, said Duncan, referring to the UK charity, Twins And Multiple Births Association.And dont feel afraid to seek support from other parents who have been through TTTS. We feel very lucky to have received the care that we did.Angelina was  weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed with Stage  TTTS, which affects the flow of blood from the placenta to each baby. The condition means one twin - the recipient - receives too much blood, with the higher blood volume putting a strain on their heart. Meanwhile, the other twin - the donor - receives too little blood. This baby often becomes smaller and anaemic - and can suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid, according to Tamba.The condition is potentially fatal, leaving both babies at risk.Angelina was monitored and she and Duncan enjoyed some normality - but by  weeks, the TTTS was found to have progressed. It was just hours before this scan, while driving, that the concerned mum-to-be had felt something wrong with her bump. She recalled: “It felt swollen and hard but also uneven making me almost hunch over which looking back was obviously the result of one of the twins having too much fluid around him. “My advice to all expectant twin mums is to keep an eye on your bump and get these things checked. We were lucky we had a scan the next morning,we didn’t it could have been a very dferent outcome.” The scan revealed one twin had no visible bladder and was stuck due to having no fluid around him, while the other had an enlarged heart due to the strain of the additional fluid.  The couple were told that without surgery they would lose both boys. And even after the procedure, they could still lose them.“I was absolutely devastated and terried. I felt a failure as a mother because my body wasn’t protecting them like it should,” said Angelina. “We’d read all the statistics about survival rates and felt so scared and nervous for the future of our unborn children. “But then reading all the information on the Tamba website really helped us and helped me stay away from the general Internet too much.” The surgery, carried out by Dr Asma Khalil at St Georges, went well. However, the worried couple were repeatedly warned that the twin left with a small placenta share may not make it. They lived in constant fear at each follow-up scan. Not long after, they celebrated reaching  weeks, knowing that one of the twins was now more than lb and the chance of survival was increasing day by day. But just five days later, Alexander and Harris arrived into the world via emergency C-section as Angelina suffered a placenta abruption and lost more than a litre of blood. The boys were in hospital for  days in total. They came out at what would have been  weeks gestation.  Duncan said: “We had many ups and downs during our stay including Alex getting very poorly with e-coli and needing ROP surgery, as well as many transfusions and Alex on and off oxygen.“Our care was split between St Peter’s in Chertsey, which we were lucky is the highest level neonatal intensive care unit in Surrey, and St George’s in London where the surgery took place. “The best thing St Peters did was to know where their knowledge finished and when it was right for us to referred to the specialists at St Georges. “This was NHS care at its best as consultants at both hospitals were amazing at treating the boys and at ensuring we were both OK and took the time to answer the many questions we both had. But he claimed: We know this isn’t always the case which is why Tamba’s research and QI programmes are so important. What is TTTS Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndromeis a rare condition that occurs in about  to  per cent of identical twin pregnancies. If left untreated,  per cent of these babies will die, Tamba says. And even with treatment, there is only up to a  per cent chance of both babies surviving.Of those that do survive, there is a chance they will suffer from a disability or health condition. Tamba says: TTTS occurs when there is an imbalance of blood supply from the placenta to the twin babies.One baby receives less bloodand often becomes smaller and anaemic. They can also suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid and become stuck to the side of the womb.The twin who receives more bloodbecomes bigger and the higher blood volume puts a strain on their heart. The charity adds: A common way to help treat TTTS is laser ablation.This is where a camera and laser are inserted into the womb and some of the shared blood vessels are coagulated using the laser. After this surgery, excess amniotic fluid in the recipient twin’s sac is also removed to achieve a normal volume. Only a handful of clinicians across the UK are able to perform laser ablation surgery on twins as it is a highly specialised procedure. Tamba’s TTTS Registry, set up in , helps specialists learn more about the potentially deadly condition. The charity is raising money to fund vital research. To donate to the cause, click here.

Trewin Restorick, chief executive and founder of Hubbub, said: “We all know plastic is a threat to our oceans but the issue can often start much closer to home. “Some % of plastic in our oceans is from land, and shockingly has been found in fish we eat such as mussels and mackerel. “Rubbish blights rivers and canals across the UK and is being eaten by birds, fish and other species, harming wildle and entering the food chain. “Not only have we got to change consumer behaviour, we need to create infrastructure to recycle all the plastics we produce. “Hopefully projects like this can show it is possible.”   Last year Hubbub launched the world’s first % recycled plastic boat, called Poly-Mer, made from , plastic water bottles. Parent Christine Armstrong at Canary Wharf College, East London, had heard about the activities of a Dutch organisation called Plastic Whale, which cleans up Amsterdam’s canals. College principal Sarah Counter adapted the idea and encouraged her students to clean up their area. Inspired by their story, Hubbub collected , plastic bottles from cycling event Ride London and set out to make the world’s first shyrecycled plastic boat. Since then they have taken more than , people “fishing” in London’s Docklands, collecting more than , plastic bottles and generating nearly pound, in shydonations for the college. These bottles will be turned into a new boat, which will be given to the winner of a competition, details of which are below. After the plastic has been collected it is sent to a factory in Dumfries, shyScotland, where it is shredded, washed and melted down before it is reshaped into plaswood – planks made up of shyrecycled plastic. Craig Gamble said: “Plaswood allows dferent types of plastics to be recycled. It is waterproof and it can be recycled again when it reaches the end of its le.” From here the planks will be sent to maverick boat maker Mark Edward, who built the Queen’s barge in , at his workshop in Richmond, South West London. “There is a real lack of dignity in recycled plastics and that really needs to change,” he explained. “It’s been a challenge to turn these plastic planks into a shypractical punt. I’ve had to forget shytraditional techniques and search on Google for shyadhesives. “But the durability of this plastic outlives timber, which requires protection and maintenance, whereas plastic requires virtually none.” Trewin added: “We’re hoping to see a range of inspiring entries, from schools to local businesses. “If you want to make a positive dference to your local environment, simply enter.” Robert Lynch, of Starbucks, said: “Reducing our impact on the shyenvironment has always been incredibly important to us – whether it’s incorporating it into the way our business operates, looking at the materials we use or making it easy for our customers to reuse or recycle. “That is why we are so pleased to be able to support this project through money that has been donated from the p charge we levy on disposable coffee cups. “We encourage everyone who wants to help clean up their local river or canal to enter. By working together, we can make a bigger impact. Good luck.” From bottle to boat . Plastic bottles dumped into the waterways are collected. . The bottles are sent to a factory in Dumfries, Scotland, where they are shredded, washed and melted down, then reshaped into plaswood planks. . They are sent to boat maker Mark Edwards in Richmond, South West London, where they are made into a punt. . Boat is launched for school trips and corporate team-building days to collect more plastic. How you can enter We want to hear from local community groups, schools or clean-up volunteers who believe having the new boat will make a huge impact on their area – and to see your photographs. The competition is open from now until midnight on January , . Four finalists will receive the boat for one week each for a clean up mission before an overall winner is picked – who will then own the boat.

Talented young sportsman Olly Liddle thought he was suffering with growing pains in his right leg but continued to play rugby and take part in school athletics. However, months later Olly and his dad Steve Liddle, , were told by doctors the teenager had osteosarcoma, an aggressive form of bone cancer just under his knee. Tragically, this is the second time the family have been struck by cancer as in  Kerrie Liddle, Ollys mum and Mr Liddles we, died after a gruelling two-year battle. “Fantastic mother” and “perfect we” Mrs Liddle passed away aged  while fighting breast cancer, when Olly was just seven and his brother Max was .  Widower Mr Liddle admits “its been a bit of a tragedy” and says he was “hit really hard when his son was diagnosed. Bu he has raised more than pound, in a charity boxing match through fundraisers Ultra White Collar Boxing. Businessman Mr Liddle, , said: Eight years ago my we was diagnosed with breast cancer and since then its been a bit of a tragedy. While she was ill her father started to get Alzheimers and her mother was diagnosed with cancer as well. Sadly we lost both of them as my we went through treatment and then my we passed away in . Fast forward six years, we were just about finding our feet when my son was diagnosed with bone cancer. I remember thinking s***, here we go again. It hit me really hard, two of the hardest things Ive ever had to do is telling my boys their mother was never coming home and tell Olly hes got cancer. Sporty Olly and his dad made the decision to have his leg amputated, rather than have doctors replace bone with metal, to remove the tumour.   However, it means he can no longer play contact sports such as rugby, leaving the young fly-half gutted. With his dads and -year-old brother Maxs support, Olly battled through chemotherapy like a proper little fighter and is now being fitted for a prosthetic leg. The determined teenager now plans on competing in triathlons, with hopes of taking part in the Paralympics. Mr Liddle, of Whitley Bay in Newcastle, said: Fortunately the cancer is quite treatable, but we had to remove the tumour which was just below the knee. It meant either keeping the leg but replacing the bone with metal, which would limit movement, or amputate the leg which completely removes the tumour. Its le changing but hes trying his best to deal with it and at the moment weve just started the process of getting fitted for a leg. The chemo has not even touched him, hes a proper little fighter, hes getting through it like a true warrior.   Finding out he can never play rugby again was hard on him, he loves playing and hes really good at it too. He had a lot of promise and its tough for him as hell miss playing. Now hes going to be looking at other sports he can take part in. There are plenty of options for people in his situation thankfully, so hes thinking about trying to get into the Paralympics in the future. Hes really keen on competing in triathlons. Ollys rugby team, Whitley Bay Rockclf Rugby Club, shaved their heads to show solidarity with him and raise money for charity. Mr Liddle said: His rugby friends have been really, really good to him. We did a headshave because he was losing all his hair and the under s all did it with him.   Then, loads of others joined in to and we had the under s doing it as well as they wanted to raise money, it was brilliant. Now, Mr Liddle has raised pound, for Cancer Research UK by stepping into a boxing ring for a charity fight. Mr Liddle, who drew the fight, said: I had never stepped into the ring before but I had to do it in memory of Kerrie and for Olly. The fight was really intense, I loved it, but Im amazed at how generous everyone has been. Speaking about his late we, Mr Liddle said its been hard for him to get by.  He said: She was a great woman, a perfect we and a fantastic mother. She had lots of friends and was very popular. When you lose the woman you love its so hard to get back on track, we were married for just over  years and I knew her for . She was very little, only ft ins, but she really fought until the end as she didnt want to lose her boys. Five days before she went doctors told us she had a week to live.

Stacey Booth, , suffered a horric campaign abuse from Alexander Heavens, also , who she had been with for seven years. Booth is now speaking out about her ordeal after Heavens pleaded guilty to engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship. Convinced she would die from his relentless abuse, Stacey, of Blackley in Greater Manchester, made secret recordings of his behaviour for her family to find in the event of her death. Manchester Crown court heard Heavens on one occasion punched her twice to the face. Prosecutor Rob Smith added: During arguments, he began bending her fingers back so far that she thought they were going to break. On one occasion she was going to sleep when he asked her a question about something on her phone, and when he didnt get a reply he punched her in the face. She remembers being pushed to the kitchen floor, stood on and trampled on. When she was asleep he would grab her finger and use it to unlock her phone as it had her fingerprint ID code.  Exhausted Stacey says she felt numb and ran on nothing, dramatically losing weight and waiting for birdsong at the end of each night to let her know she could escape to go to work. She says she became so convinced she would end up dead that she started making secret recordings of Heavens nightly activity and sending them to herself to let her family know what had happened. Heavens will face sentencing next May. Now bravely speaking out about her ordeal, Stacey hopes that her terrying story will inspire others to get out of abusive and controlling relationships. Stacey said: You think its going to be your happy ever after story. You get engaged and think youre going to get married but then reality set in and it just got worse and worse and worse.  I feel like having that ring and being engaged gave him more control over me. I had a voice at the beginning. But the more he did to me the more my voice just went away. I used to record him towards the end because I felt like no one would believe me. Thats what helped me get him into the courtroom. I used to put my phone face down and as he drted off to sleep Id put my camera on because I knew hed start. My phone would record the whole night. I would wake up and he would be trying to get on my phone and he would be that drugged up and drunk that he would be recording me sleeping. He would be saying put your password in your phone, put it in your phone. He would check through all my social media, all my work friends who I work with. He used to check through everything. The last year, I felt like someone I worked with would [end up] working on my body. It just felt like a matter of time. It got to the point where I thought I would go home and no one knew anything about it, anything about me or what I was going through. I actually sat there in work and thought this could be my family sat at this table, this could be my mum, my dad, my brothers, sat at this table talking about me because of what hes done.  Nobody would know my story and I would have no voice. I think thats why I started to record things. I felt like one day I wouldnt be here to tell anyone what had happened to me. It was really like coming into the workplace that I work in and seeing other people lose people which kept me going because I always felt like there was someone worse off than me. I was just grinning and bearing it and trying to get on with it. It was hard. I was absolutely terried. I was numb. At work nothing would affect me because I constantly felt numb throughout it all. I felt like it wasnt real. I was so tired, so exhausted and I was just getting through each day - although I dont know how. I was running on nothing. I wasnt eating. [Making those recordings] was like a survival instinct. I thoughtone day they go on my laptop, they will see what he did to me. I was hiding evidence on my laptop in case anything ever came of it and I wasnt here to tell the story. I kind of came to terms with it because I just knew it was a matter of time. I never saw an escape or thought Id be able to get through it. I never saw any positive from it, I just thought this is my le now for the rest of my le, however long it lasts. I would just have to get up, get on and deal with it because I was not sleeping, eating. Everything was so restricted.  It was her first relationship and although she says she saw signs of abusive behaviour from the startshe made exceptions for him because she was young and in love. However, after the pair got engaged on Staceys st birthday in , she claims Heavens behaviour changed. The court heard the couples relationship soured in Christmas  after he suffered bouts of paranoia due to his cocaine use. Stacey claims she would often visit her mum for a cup of tea after she finished work, and Heavens became jealous and paranoid about where she was. She says Heavens kept picking arguments with her about it until he allegedly bit her and bruised her upper arm with his teeth. Stacey says she tried to defend herself against his punches and hair pulling but eventually became frightened and apologised for her actions until she convinced herself she deserved the abuse. Too terried to even tell her family, she made excuses to avoid showing them her scars and bruises - including keeping her coat on as she ate Christmas dinner with her mum. Stacey said: For months after I left him I used to cry every time I heard the birds tweeting because it would remind me of that sense that Ive got through another night. He used to put me through absolute hell. It was never really spoken about [between us]. I tried to forget it because I knew the next night would be worse. If I pulled it up on what hed done it would have made my night worse the night after it.  One night he was asking me five questions on his hand: have I ever been disloyal to him, have I ever done this or that. I answered all of them perfectly and because it was his mind that was so out of control he started to go back over the five questions. He got to the third, and the next thing I remember was him hitting me right in the face. My ears were ringing and I just remember going funny. I saw my work logo and I remember looking at it and then myself in the mirror and thinking who are you. I thought in my brain I know that from somewhere, I know that, what is that. I was so confused in my brain I didnt know where I was. I kept saying who are you, whats happened, why am I here to him. I ended up curling into a ball and lay at the bottom of the bed. I remember turning my back to him and trying to go so close to him and trying to make him hug me because I was terried he was going to kill us both or just me or himself.  Brave Stacey found the strength to flee her home shortly before her rd birthday in October . She packed a bag and moved into her mums house while Heavens was at work. But despite not being with him for more than a year, Stacey claims she still feels that he has some control over her mind - although she is slowly learning to find happiness again. Stacey said: In the end I moved up to my mums when he went to work. I got all my stuff together. He was still living in my house for two days afterwards. After three days passed my mum looked at me and said, what has he done to you. She said I just looked at a wall for two days straight and didnt make any comment of why Id come. He would say he was coming to the door and was texting and ringing me. He was counting down on text message like , , , andyou dont answer then Im coming through the house. I had to tell everyone because he was going to do something to me or my family. We just got the police involved from there on. Obviously my family have supported me, and Ive stayed with my mum ever since.  You cant live a normal le even though Im out of it. I would be scared to leave the house just in case. I was rated as the highest priority with the police because of what he was doing to me in my relationship. In over a year while Ive not been with him Ive gained three stone and Im a lot happier. That was just living in a box room at my mums house with nothing. I took nothing with me. Ive never been back to the room where it happened. He was that controlling that, even a year and more on, he still has control over me. He still crosses my mind every time I make a decision. Still. Thats how much hes affected me. He was just so controlling over everything. A simple yes or no would be overridden by him. Even my mum said to me not so long ago that Im finally starting to say yes when I mean yes and no when I mean no. The last year Ive realised how much hes pulled my family apart. I just look at my mum and think shes aged five years in one year knowing whats happened to me. Now I sit and think to myself how could somebody do that to somebody  I didnt deserve to be treated like that. I am definitely feeling positive about the future now. Now the dust has settled and theres an outcome, I want to help others. I want to start my own safe place just to say to other people there is an escape because you literally cannot see an escape when youre going through it.

Were accustomed to hearing people raise their voice during Question Time and talk over their fellow politicians to get their point accross. But thankfully there are some among us who still think this kind of behaviour is unnacceptable. One such person is -year-old Ella Ezergailis from Canberra in Australia. Young Ella was recently offered the chance to attend Question Time at the Australian Parliament House after being accepted into a program called Girls Takeover Parliament.   The school student was excited to learn more about politics, but what she saw during her visit left her feeling embarrassed. She claims to have been disappointed by the behaviour of the politicians and has since penned an incredible letter to Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister of Australia. A copy of Ellas letter was shared by news.au. It reads: Dear Prime Minister Morrison, my name is Ella Ezergailis and Im  years old.   On  Nov , I was privileged to participate in Girls Takeover Parliament. I was paired with Ms Gai Brodtmann, Member for Canberra and I had an amazing experience. I am very passionate about girls and young people having a voice in our country, which Gai mentioned in her  second speech to Parliament and I feel that I need to bring an issue to your attention. I was so excited to attend Question Time for the first time ever but was very disappointed and embarrassed by how a majority of the Parliamentarians behaved. Ella went on to explain that during her visit, she saw about six Members of Parliament get kicked out of the chamber and that these people were setting a very bad example for young people.   She continued: I think they should be setting a better example by behaving more respectfully, listening to each other, letting each others talk and express their ideas and not shouting at each other, because this achieves nothing. The youngster admitted she didnt think school children should visit Parliament House anymorethats how people were going to behave, but instead the MPs should come to her school to see how they run their student parliament. We respect others, listen when they are speaking, give supportive suggestions to their ideas and make sure to uphold our school values, everybody counts. She then pleaded with the Prime Minister to fix the problem: As Prime Minister you have the power to affect change and I ask you to be a change leader in creating a more respectful, inclusive, co-operative and supportive culture in Parliament.

The -year-old sneakerhead, showed off his unique house in a new documentary called The Worlds Weirdest Homes, which aired on Wednesday night. Presenter Charlie Luxton travels to destinations including Arizona in the US, Dubai and Rio de Janiero to discover a number of unique homes in the Channel  show, which included an interview with Rashed.  The super-rich teen is known as his name of Money Kicks on Instagram, an account which boasts over .million followers and showcases his extravagant lestyle. In the documentary he spoke of his aspirations to follow in his billionaire construction mogul father Sa Ahmed Belhasas footsteps by creating a fortune of his own. From the giant living room, a private zoo is visible which holds big cats such as lions, tigers, panthers, leopards and cheetahs, as well as giraffes and bears. A-List celebrities often visit the zoo - and the teen has even named some of the animals after his VIP guests. The animals have names like Versace the lion, Gucci and Dior the orangutans, giraffes called Bert and Ernie, Armani the chimp . Some of them are invited inside the mansion for snuggles on occasion.  Celebrity visitors include Mariah Carey, Ronaldo, Floyd Mayweather, Rihanna, Paris Hilton, and Jackie Chan - and all of them have animals named after them. When the filmmaker askedhe is the only child in the world with his own private zoo, Rashed replied: You could say that. I don’t like to show off. Rasheds father, billionaire UAE businessman Sa Ahmed Belhasa, owns over  exotic animals which he collected from other private zoos that were neglected. As the zoo is not open to the public, the family does not make a profit and he shut down any suggestions that the animals are mistreated. He said: We take care of all our animals. When I went to Kenya, I see a lot of lions dying because they eat once a month and here they eat every single day.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un continues to mass produce and deploy the existing types of nuclear warheads in the countrys arsenal. The images, obtained by CNN, show the mountainous Yeongjeo-dong missile base and a new nearby site are active and have been constantly upgraded. These upgrades came despite Jong-un claiming it is willing to work towards denuclearisation. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearisation at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specics and negotiations have made little headway.  Shortly after that summit, Trump tweeted that there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. North Korea has said it has closed its Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and the Sohae missile engine test facility. But these images show the construction of a new facility just seven miles away from the Yeongjeo-dong base, which has been known to US intelligence agencies. A report issued by the Middlebury Institute report states: Satellite images show that the base remains active. Moreover, in the past year North Korea has signicantly expanded a nearby facility that appears to be another missile base. They dont knowthe bases are separate orone is superior to the other.  CNN reports these images indicate North Korea was building a huge underground facility in  and it was still under construction in August . Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey told CNN: Construction on the previously unidentied site has continued even after the Singapore Summit. Mr Lewis and his colleague David Schmerler say the sites location would make it a prime location for their new long-range missiles, including those which can carry nuclear weapons and could hit the US. We watch North Korea very closely. We continue to support the diplomatic process. We will not discuss matters of intelligence, Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Chris Logan told CNN. The State Department said it does not comment on intelligence matters.  South Koreas Defense Ministry, citing the countrys Joint Chiefs of Staff said Yeongjeo-ri is one of the important North Korean sites that is being tracked and surveilled in cooperation with the United States. A spokesman added: It is not appropriate for our military to officially acknowledge the content of a foreign media report. National security adviser John Bolton said he will push ahead with plans for a second summit with Jong-un. While Trump maintains Kim promised to fully denuclearise, the actual agreement they signed is quite vague.In it, they pledge to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and to work toward complete denuclearisation of the peninsula.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone.

There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c07d657d12d4.jpg ","title":"dundee united can follow ayrs example in how to react to a rout","story":"Dundee United are licking their wounds after a mauling dished out by Ayr at the weekend – to get back on track, though, they can take a leaf out of the Honest Men’s book.The Tangerines were given a home humbling by former manager Ian McCall’s league leaders on Friday night to bring Robbie Neilson’s Tannadice revival to a shuddering halt.The United boss has described the result as a “boulder in the road” rather than just a bump and is hoping his side can put the result firmly behind them by going straight out and making it six wins from Robbie’s first eight matches in charge by beating Greenock Morton on Saturday.And for inspiration they don’t have to look too far.Just like United were going into Friday night’s clash, Ayr were riding the crest of a wave at the start of the season.Seven wins and two draws from their opening nine fixtures of the campaign saw them continue the superb form that led them to the League One title last season.That run included a - win at Dens Park against Premiership Dundee, where the Honest Men completely outplayed the top-flight side, and a - home win over a Dunfermline side that had started the campaign strongly, too.Then, however, came their own shuddering halt to the form that had seen them sweep almost all before them on September  at Palmerston.Queen of the South had enjoyed a fairly up-and-down beginning to the season and weren’t expected to be the first team to stop Ayr’s momentum.A first-half blitz, however, shocked the rest of the Championship as Queens rattled up a four-goal lead inspired by their main man Stephen Dobbie and his partner-in-crime Gary Harkins.A hat-trick inside  minutes had the Doonhamers cruising before Harkins curled in against his old side with  minutes on the clock.Dobbie added a fourth in the closing stages to seal victory and give the Honest Men their first real test of the campaign.Many expected the wheels to come off at that point, as has happened to plenty of teams before, and for the newly- promoted Honest Men to fall back down the table.That looked the case the following week, too, as Falkirk, under new boss Ray McKinnon, raced into a - lead within  minutes at Somerset Park.However, that’s where the rot stopped – something Dundee United will be keen to emulate this coming Saturday, though they’d prefer not to give hosts Morton a lead first.The second half saw Lawrence Shankland find the net before a quickfire double from Andy Geggan and a Leo Fasan own goal gave Ayr the kind of response Robbie Neilson is desperate for.From there, McCall’s side have lost just the once – to Ross County – and drawn with Queens and Morton to regain top spot in the table.And they more than cemented that on Friday night at Tannadice.The question now for Dundee United is whether they can emulate their title rivals by getting back on form as quickly as possible.Victory against Morton would be one step closer to the manager’s goal of promotion while anything  would allow both Ayr and Ross County to open up a sizeable gap above the Tannadice club.However, Ayr have shown the Tangerines how to recover from a hammering – the test for Robbie Neilson and his men is whether they can do the same to get that “boulder” out of their way, starting on Saturday at Cappielow."},{"url":null,"title":"neil mccann claims outside influences led to dundee sack","story":"Former Dundee manager Neil McCann has defended his time in charge of the club, claiming ‘outside influences’ had a part to play in his dismissal.McCann was relieved of his duties at Dens Park in October – leaving the Dark Blues marooned at the foot of the Premiership table with just three points to their name after eight games.And asked why he feels he was let go, despite talk of an experienced No  coming in to help him which never came to fruition, he said: “I don’t know. I could say ‘I’m going to change things’ and the team knew that, the coaching staff knew that and the club knew that as well but ultimately it comes down to results.“Outside influences can be strong and the club felt they wanted a change. They’re entitled to make the change, they pay those wages that they were giving me.“I’m of the opinion I would have turned things around. Eight games into the campaign and not a million miles away from eigth, ninth, seventh – it wasn’t too far away.“It goes back to what I was saying about players, when you’re asked to do something with the budget and bring in certain players who I believe will mature into good players, playing my type of football then they’ve got to be given time.“Time can run out pretty fast when results aren’t coming, especially maybe when outside influences are becoming stronger.”McCann admits it was a shock to be sacked but feels he had the players confidence and that they can stay up under new boss Jim McIntyre.He added: “I don’t know, only time will tell but I do believe there’s good enough players in there to absolutely survive in the Scottish Premiership.”"},{"url":null,"title":"o2 network outage puts angus councils off street parking meters out of use","story":"All of Angus Council#s off-street car park meters are out of use due to UK-wide #network issues#, reports The Courier.The local authority took to Twitter to inform locals that the machines, which were controversially reintroduced on November , are down.They have been affected by a network problem affecting all of the UK.The parking meters have been covered up until the issue is fixed.mdash Angus CouncilDecember , Angus Council tweeted: #All parking meters in our off –street car parks are unavailable for use due to network issues which are currently affecting a number of services UK-wide.#This is an intermittent fault but the meters will be covered until this matter is fully resolved.#Local O customers have also reported issues, with many people in Dundee left unable to use data or make calls.mdash O in the UKDecember , mdash O in the UKDecember , mdash O in the UKDecember , It is unclear whether the O outage, said to be the result of a #global software issue#, is linked to the problems with Angus Council#s parking meters.mdash Amy MilneDecember , mdash Colindufc🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿December , In a statement, O said: #All O technical teams are working closely with one of our third party suppliers who has identied a global software issue in their system which has impacted data services.#As a result of this incident, we are experiencing a high demand on our network which means some customers may have issues making and receiving voice calls.#We believe other mobile operators around the world are also affected.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7215913.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"may-deploys-travelling-sales-ministers-as-backbench-offers-brexit-deal-lifeline","story":"Senior Cabinet ministers including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are among those who will make another late push to garner support for Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement ahead of Tuesdayrsquos vote.They hit the road after MPs tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement that would give MPs some control over the controversial Northern Ireland border backstop, which has been the main sticking point after two years of negotiations.Todayrsquos #MeaningfulVote debate was opened by Chancellor for the Exchequer, @PhilipHammondUK.Watch him tell MPs why he supports the Governmentrsquos #WithdrawalAgreement: https:t.co SkgGjKeqzB pic ehcSLrnkmdash UK House of CommonsDecember , The alteration would mean Parliament would have to approve a decision to trigger the backstop arrangement or extend the transition period beyond December .It was tabled by Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire, Richard Graham and Bob Neill, hours after the Prime Minister indicated Parliament would choose between the two options after the UK formally quits the EU.The move is likely to be seen as a bid to bolster flagging support for Mrs May ahead of a crunch Commons vote on her EU withdrawal deal next Tuesday ndash a showdown the PM made clear on Thursday morning she would not postpone.But it remains to be seen whether it goes far enough to win over enough Tory Brexiteers to get the deal through the Commons.Domestic legislative tinkering wonrsquot cut it.

been good for the economy than bad.But their study also reveals signicant iations by party ndash with SNP voters more likely to take a positive view.Meanwhile, those who back Labour and the Tories in Scotland are less likely to support immigration than their counterparts down south.SNP MSP Stuart McMillan said people across Scotland and the UK ldquoclearly recognise the benefits of migration for our economy, culture and wider society.He added: ldquoThatrsquos why it is so absurd that the Tories want to end free movement once we leave the EU, which will harm our NHS, our universities, key industries and our ability to work and travel across Europe.ldquoThis is why the SNP will fight to remain within the EU through a second referendum or, failing that, stay within the single market, which is eight times bigger than the UK alone.The new report was authored by polling guru Sir John Curtice and researcher Ian Montagu.Using data from the most recent British and Scottish social attitudes surveys, they found little dference in attitudes towards immigration among voters in Scotland, England and Wales.But while nearly three-fths of Labour supporters down south think migration is good for Britainrsquos economy, only around halfof the partys voters in Scotland share this view.Similarly, three in ten Scottish Tory backers believe migration has been beneficial ndash compared with nearly two-fths in England and Wales.The study reveals % of Scottish Tory voters actually believe migration is bad for the economy, noticeably higher than the equivalent figure of % south of the Border.Mr Curtice and Mr Montagu said the dference between Scotland the rest of the UK resides in how attitudes are reflected in the ballot box.They said: ldquoThe SNP has gathered for itself an electorate that is relatively positive about immigration, an electorate whose views are then counterbalanced to some degree by a pattern of support for other parties in Scotland that is somewhat less positive towards migration than is found among those in England and Wales who back such parties.ldquoSupport for Scottish independence is associated with a more positive outlook too, even though on its own a strong Scottish identity is not.They said their analysis is a ldquoreminder of the dangers of attempting to infer the prevalence of attitudes from the outcome of an election or a referendum, adding: ldquoTwo sets of voters with very similar attitudes to each other can behave very dferentlythe political choices with which they are presented and the political appeals to which they are

parliamentary protocol.During PMQs, the Highland MP claimed Mrs May had misled the House ldquoinadvertently or otherwise.As Tory MPs shouted ldquowithdraw, the Speaker intervened to rebuke the SNP leader, stressing there could be ldquono ambiguity\" in comments to suggest the PM had purposefully misled the House.This led Mr Blackford to alter his wording to say she had done it \"perhaps inadvertently\".However, this led to even louder jeers from the Tory benches and Mr Bercow asked him again to \"rephrase\" his words. The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber continued unchallenged after removing the word ldquoperhaps from his subsequent remarks.In her response, the PM stressed how there was no dference between what Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, had said in a statement to the Commons on Monday and the published legal advice.Later, outwith the chamber, Mr Blackford declared: ldquoItrsquos absolutely conclusive that the PM has misled the House relating to the permanency of the backstop.He replied: ldquoLet us call a spade a spade. On the basishellipshe had the legal advice when she spoke in the House of Commons, then shersquos lied, yes.The published paper from Mr Cox - in bold type - states: ldquoDespite statements in the Protocol that it[the backstop] is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its placehellipThe six-page document also said that under the proposed arrangements, \"for regulatory purposes, GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI\".Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist Party leader at Westminster, described the legal advice as \"devastating\" and said it made clear the proposed backstop was \"unacceptable\" and must be defeated.Sir Keir Starmer for Labour said the legal advice had confirmed \"the central weaknesses in the Governments deal\".As the PM continued her Commons meetings with Tory MPs, saying she was ldquolistening to the concerns of colleagues about ldquothe way forward, it emerged No  was discussing a plan to give MPs a vote on whether the UK should enter the backstop at all orthe Brexit Plan should be scrapped altogether.But ardent Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the Downing St strategy, saying: ldquoIt is silly and few are falling for it.Meanwhile, it was suggested EU chiefs are preparing for a May defeat by putting the issue of extending Article  on the agenda for the December European Council, which takes place two days after next Tuesdayrsquos Commons vote.The continuing row at Westminster came as Holyrood formally voted against both Mrs Mays Brexit deal and the prospect of quitting the EU with no deal in place.MSPs voted by  to  for a motion which said both these options \"would be damaging for Scotland and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole\".As a result, they called for the Brexit deal to be rejected when it is voted on at Westminster on December  and for \"a better alternative be taken forward\".Today, David Mundell will open up a new front in the Brexit row when he calls on Nicola Sturgeon to ldquoopen her ears to Scottish business and back the PMrsquos withdrawal plan.In a speech in London, the Scottish Secretary will say: ldquoIf she genuinely wants to represent Scotlandrsquos views she has to stop lecturing and start listening.ldquoIf she listened, shersquod know we have a workable solution.

It was full of nettles and less than a metre wide. We managed to enter it and there was a section of boulders ndash we moved them out of the way and then there was a ft drop. That led to a spectacular chamber  yards by  feet ndash big enough to stand up in. The stones were blue and purple. It was some incredible sight.ldquoWe managed to explore  yards before finding the route choked with sediment. We plan towith a team in the New Year to dig it out and explore further.ldquoThe theory and hope is it could extend all the way to Smoo Cave which would make it by far the longest cave in Scotland and with the most spectacular of entrances ndash or exits, depending on the start point ndash at Smoo.Scotlandrsquos longest cave is currently the Cave of the Sloping Rock in nearby Assynt which is . miles long.The longest cave system in the UK is the Three Counties System in the Yorkshire Dales, with . miles of passageway, while the longest in the world is the appropriately-named Mammonth Cave in Brownsville, Kentucky with more than  miles explored.Smoo Cave is the largest coastline cave in the British Isles and has provided shelter for thousands of years. It is believed to have been a Stone Age home more than , years ago with Norse settlers later gathering here to repair boats and fish for herring.It has one of the largest entrances to any sea cave in Britain at  ft high. It was formed by a burn that runs down into the rear chamber, as well as erosion caused by the sea.Mr Greig added: ldquoIf it links up to the new discovery it will be one of the best caving experiences in the UK. It is a treasure trove for geologists. Over the two days we have explored the new cave we even found a white freshwater eel which has never seen sunlight.ldquoThe drought helped us because the cave floods in wet conditions, and up to the roof in places. Itrsquos like a big treasure hunt, but we do not know what the treasure is yet. It is what most cavers dream of. This is the final frontier of exploration in Scotland. Every inch of the country has been mapped by satellite ndash itrsquos what remains under the surface that remains the big mystery.Fellow caver Colin Coventry, who for more than  years has led tours at Smoo Cave, added: ldquoFor many years I have been convinced that Smoo was linked to one long cave. We believe the biggest cave in Scotland is here and waiting to be found.ldquoThis looks like it. But it is spectacularly dangerous.ldquoI would certainly not take tours there.

Others were said to be frustrated by Mrs Mayrsquos non-inclusive approach.Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, admitted that trying to convince Tory MPs to back the Brexit deal was \"an uphill challenge\" and admitted there was \"no plan\"the Commons rejected it.David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, called on MPs to vote down Mrs Mays Plan and \"make sure the stake goes through its heart\".Today, some  ministers are being dispatched to the four corners of the UK to sell it as the clock ticks down to Tuesdayrsquos moment of truth at Westminster.David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, will host a business roundtable in Glasgow, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, will tour engineering companies in Peterborough, Chancellor Philip Hammond will visit a school in Surrey, and Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, will visit a hospital in Portsmouth.The PM said: ldquoIrsquove been speaking to factory workers in Scotland, farmers in Wales and people right across the country, answering their questions about the deal and our future.ldquoOverwhelmingly, the message Irsquove heard is that people want us to get on with it. And thatrsquos why itrsquos important that ministers are out speaking with communities across the UK today about how the deal works for them.As Mrs May continued with what was dubbed a ldquodesperation strategy, ITV announced it had followed the BBC in scrapping its plans for a televised head-to-head debate between the PM and Jeremy Corbyn.The commercial network withdrew after Labour and the Conservatives had spent days rowing over the issue.It means the party leadersrsquo face-off is now unlikely to happen, meaning the only pre-vote debate will be on Channel  on Sunday night, involving \"four high-profile politicians,\" reflecting a range of views.With their leader facing a devastating Commons defeat, senior colleagues urged her to pull Tuesdayrsquos vote.Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the partyrsquos backbench  Committee, suggested it would be \"perfectly sensible\" to postpone the meaningful vote unless the PM could deliver a means for the UK to unilaterally leave the Irish backstop.The Cheshire MP said there was ldquono sense in proceeding and losing heavily\".At a journalistsrsquo lunch at Westminster, Mr Blair said he too did not see the point of going down to a huge parliamentary defeat and hitting ldquothat brick wall at speed\".But Mrs Mayrsquos spokesman brushed aside suggestions of pulling the vote and insisted: \"The vote will take place on Tuesday as planned.\"Earlier, the PM confirmed that she had been discussing with Tory MPs how they could be given the power to decidethe UK went into the controversial backstop or adopted the alternative of extending the -month transition period.However, it appeared another desperate move to try to reduce the scale of the Tory rebellion next week.Yet talk of extending the transition period will raise Scottish Conservative fears that this might lead to the fishing industry having to continue to comply with the hated EUrsquos Common Fisheries Policy during any extension.As MPs debated the Brexit deal for a third day, Mr Hammond said it was \"simply a delusion\" to think a better Brexit deal could be renegotiated at the th hour after warning a no-deal was \"too awful to contemplate\".The Chancellor faced dissent from Tory backbenchers as he warned a no-deal would see the end of frictionless trade, restrictions on EU travelling rights and large tarfs for UK exporters.With the SNP and Labour continuing to hold talks on what alternative to the May Plan the two leading opposition parties could coalesce around, sources in both parties told The Herald that the ldquodirection of travel was towards a Peoplersquos Vote.At the Westminster lunch, Mr Blair said the passing of the Grieve amendment, which opens the way for MPs to vote for an alternative way forward, meant the UK Parliament was now operating like a ldquoShadow Government, having taken ldquoeffective charge of the process surrounding Brexit.The former Labour leader said it was impossible for Mrs May to square the circle on Brexit and so there should be a Peoplersquos Vote.He also revealed that he was ldquoreally worried about the consequences of Brexit for the UK.Describing himself as a ldquopassionate Unionist, the former PM explained: ldquoI donrsquot think necessarily in the short term but in the longer termwe pull out of Europe, it is a further, additional argument for those who make the case for Scottish independence. I donrsquot agree with that case but where there is a strong majority in Scotland for being part of Europe, particularly among younger people, as time goes on, itrsquos a risk.Elsewhere, Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd resigned the Liberal Democrat whip, saying he was now backing Mrs Mayrsquos Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrating-250-years-of-encyclopaedia-britannica","story":"Such as the very succinct four-word definition of woman: ldquoThe female of man.And, what must have been terrying for anyone who dared to indulge in an evening puff of their pipe, a dire warning that excess use of tobacco caused neurodegeneration, ldquodrying up the brain to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes.The first instalments of Encyclopaeligdia Britannica arrived in Edinburgh homes exactly  years ago this week, offering essential, albeit certainly rather weighty, reading. For a start, the section on anatomy alone spanned an eye-watering  double-column pages and filled more than six issues.Its scientic approach to nature and medicine prompted some to brand the new book as the ldquogospel of Satan, its graphic depictions of dissected female pelvises and foetuses in its articles on childbirth were so controversial that an enraged King George III demanded the offending pages be ripped from every copy.But for those hardy Scots who stuck with it from A to Z, the result was a formidable wealth of knowledge, an essential three volume weapon in the armoury of the great minds of the Scottish Enlightenment, and an encyclopedia that would go on to become one of the best known of its kind, found in homes and classrooms across the world.The th anniversary of Britannicarsquos publication is now set to be marked by a series of events organised by the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh.These include a sell-out talk by Professor Stephen Brown of Trent University in Ontario, who plans to unravel the roots and spotlight the often very eccentric characters behind the launch of one of Scotlandrsquos most extraordinary publications.It was Saturday, December , probably late in the day and in Stairs Close just off the Lawnmarket in Edinburghrsquos Old Town, when the first copies of Encyclopaeligdia Britannica made their way from the publishersrsquo offices into the eager hands of the capitalrsquos society.It was the idea of printer Colin Macfarquhar, who driven by a determination to produce a book of knowledge by Scots and for Scots, had joined forces with the diminutive ft ins figure of engraver Andrew Bell.Neither, according to Mr Brown, had any formal education to speak of ndash Macfarquhar had just been released from his apprenticeship, Bell was the son of a baker ndash but both had spotted a niche in the publishing market for a weighty tome that would offer the Scots in the age of enlightenment an up to date and informed source of global knowledge.The pair engaged William Smellie, who had edited the Scots Magazine for five years and who had used Bell as an engraver.However large parts of the first edition were ndash by Smelliersquos own admission ndash an th century version of todayrsquos ldquoctrl-C ctrl-V, and simply chopped from other publications using a trusty pair of scissors, and pasted on to the pages, errors and all.Perhaps to avoid the risk of the learned establishment of Edinburgh pouring scorn on their credentials as authors of an encyclopedia, the group referred to themselves simply as ldquoA Society of Gentlemen in Scotland.The first edition was published in instalments between December  and , at a time when the dodo still thrived, freshly-cut onions were recorded in its pages as a cure for baldness and Calornia described as located in the West Indies, ldquounknown whether it is an island or a peninsula.According to Mr Brown, Britannica was heavily promoted for its Scottishness. ldquoIt included many Scottish sources and had a long treatise on Scots Law, he adds. The adverts also encouraged subscribers to be patriotic and purchase this first ever encyclopaedia by Scots.ldquoThe three founders were not Jacobites. They were typical of the Edinburgh business and intellectual community who promoted a strong Scottish identity within a healthy Union. They recognised the benefits of peace to commerce. Thus the Britannica within the title.A novel early feature was Smelliersquos inclusion of treatises, some of which, like anatomy left readers with an astonishing amount of content to consume and sparked complaints from some who simply couldnrsquot cope with the extreme verbosity.As a result, while the first volume covered just the first three letters of the alphabet, leaving the second two volumes to hurriedly handle the remaining .ldquoThe illustrations amounted to  engravings and several thousand figures, all executed by Andrew Bell, adds Mr Brown. ldquoThe most notorious were his engravings of a foetus in the womb in the treatise on midwery.ldquoThey were copied from the other William Smelliersquos book on midwery aimed at medical specialist. But the Britannica was the first book intended for public consumption to include such graphic medical illustrations.Perhaps the adverse publicity and wrath of royalty helped. The first edition sold enough copies to enough to warrant an updated second edition.However, a row between Smellie and the Duke of Buccleuch, a major subscriber, over biographical information sparked his resignation.Perhaps it was no surprise that the chore of writing the next volume would go to an equally unusual character, James Tytler, the first man to successfully fly a hot air balloon in Great Britain and whose personal fortunes had already careered from whaling ship surgeon to debtorsrsquo prison and a love affair with the bottle.He penned , pages and increased the encyclopedia from three volumes to nine, mostly writing hunched over his washerwoman landladyrsquos upturned washtub and locked in his room by the publishers who feared he might escape.Tytler was paid a pittance for his work, but supplemented his income by writing a guide to Edinburghrsquos prostitutes which rated their looks, performance and teeth.Incredibly,  years later, several first edition copies of the encyclopedia are still in circulation.Mr Brown added: ldquoThere are  sets are currently listed in the English Short Title Catalogue in libraries around the world, and there are others in private hands."},{"url":null,"title":"dream-of-refloating-the-maid-of-the-loch-lives-on","story":"ldquoIt is going to take some time to absorb this news and the reasons behind it\", said John Beveridge, chairman of Loch Lomond Steamship Company, which has been restoring the vessel since .The charity, however, promised that the decision ldquois not the end of the road and said it still firmly believed in the project.Yesterday it learned that a pound, capital grant funding award by the Scottish Government had been confirmed, meaning that the goal of ing the ship to sail lives on.The package from the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund , awarded earlier this year, hung in the balance following the \"disappointing\" news from Heritage Lottery Fund .The charity said the Scottish Government announcement meant that the Maid could look forward to  \"with a renewed focus, with work already confirmed including repairs to the shiprsquos hull, creation of an on-board education facility, refurbishing the mainsuite, and overhauling the engines to enable them to turn with steam.\"Mr Beveridge said: ldquoThis is a huge boost to the project and will transform the Maidrsquos attraction to visitors.

It will be the first time any work has been done on the hull since , so there is great excitement among our volunteers who canrsquot wait to help.The biggest transformation to the ship next year will see the engines turning under steam power. Work will include having the engines professionally overhauled, new pipework installed, and a mobile boiler plant sited on the pier producing enough steam to allow the paddles to turn.The engine room last month received two feed boiler pumps, a critical component in getting the ship sailing once again, from Coatbridges Summerlee Heritage Museum.Mr Beveridge added: ldquoEveryone who has visited the Maid over the years have said we must get this beautul ship sailing again. Getting her in steam and with her paddles turning again is the next best thing, and we anticipate great interest next year as people come to watch her majestic engines moving for the first time in  years.The Paddle Steamer Preservation Society has also confirmed a grant of pound, will still be granted, taking this work package to pound million.The Maid currently operates as a static tourist attraction and hopes to earn industrial museum status for the ship and steam slipway as a growing number of artefacts are collected and restored to working condition."},{"url":null,"title":"dyce carvery launches the ultimate festive treat","story":"Christmas is all about twinkling lights and sparkle, and a Dyce carvery is set to prove the point as it launches the ultimate festive treat# GLITTER GRAVY.The Dyce Farm carvery on International Drive, Dyce Drive is offering its guests the chance to add some shimmer to their festive dinner with glittery gravy throughout December.The sparkling menu addition is available at the Farmhouse Inns carvery to enjoy with a selection of traditional roast meats, seasonal vegetables, signature roast potatoes and the pub’s famous giant Yorkshire puddings.John Tracey, general manager at the Dyce Farm, said: “Our carveries are a firm favourite for the run up to Christmas, but this year we wanted to take the celebrations to a whole new level by making the UK’s most festive gravy!“Christmas is all about decoration and sparkle, so we thought why not add a touch of this to our seasonal menu to spread some extra Christmas cheer.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

She believes that voting for that deal is way to resolve these issues.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839946.1544034461!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit s causes would remain even if it s prevented malcolm bruce","story":"The UK needs to find ways to improve the lives of justiably angry people who voted for Brexit, writes Liberal Democrat peer Malcolm Bruce.The Brexit referendum opened deep isions within the UK between those who feel ignored, frustrated and forgotten, and an apparently indferent establishment.Globalisation has left many better off. However, it has also led to rapid change which, for many people, has meant the decline of their communities whose economic reason to exist has moved where. We may have record numbers in employment, but many people find themselves stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs. People are angry, and justiably so. People have seen their pay cut and opportunities diminish while those driving the economy got richer even when it was their decisions had made millions poorer. The excesses of capitalism must be addressed. We must enact economic reforms to ensure a fairer society. Liberal democracy is based on markets, free trade and free enterprise. But these need to be servants, not masters of a liberal society. One major issue is the UK economy is consumer driven. We inflate the value of our real estate, borrow against these assets and buy goods and services which mostly we don’t produce.One way to tackle this would be to introduce land-value taxation. This would not only discourage speculative land hoarding, but it is an initial step in introducing taxes on wealth rather than income. It ensures that those iniduals with high-value net worth contribute fairly to the community. Land and property speculation should no longer be the principal driver of our economy.In Germany, their economy is driven by investmentand skills and company ownership is held more through direct investors and workers, rather than institutional shareholders looking for short-term gains. The Liberal Democrats have long called for workers representative on boards, the encouragement of worker share ownership, and partnerships and supervisory boards with wider responsibilities than just shareholder . Liberal Democrats believe that it is vital that everyone is given a stake in our economy, that we can only be united and competitive as a countrythe rewards are reaped by all.: Brexit deal will cost us £bn, says Nicola SturgeonThe UK still suffers tension between the roles of the state and the private sector, instead of the promotion of creative partnership. People are also being confronted with utilities raising prices ahead of inflation whilst delivering poor service. Rail services are equally expensive and unreliable.To answer this, Labour has revitalised its Marxist-Leninist credentials and is proposing wholesale nationalisation. To a younger generation with no memory of the Soviet Union or the tussles over Clause  of the Labour Party constitution, it might seem attractive to bring gas, electricity, water and the railways back into public ownership.After all, wouldn’t that mean fuel bills would be kept down and the trains would run on time with lower fares  Not necessarily. British Rail was famous for dreadful food, poor timekeeping and under-investment.How would Labour pay for the shares and how would utilities and railways secure funding in competition with health, education, and welfare  Seizing the assets would destroy investment and collapse pension funds. It would be far better to give consumers and rail passengers a more direct role in the running of these companies, rather than having to own them.: Police Scotland officers could be sent to Northern Ireland during BrexitMuch of the inequality in the United Kingdom can be attributed to where you live. Therefore, it is vital we unlock the positive energy of our communities. In Scotland, having our own Parliament with signicant powers gives us control of our domestic affairs to address our distinctive needs and culture. We should be using those powers to pursue policies to improve our quality of le and strengthen our economy, which remains too dependent on the public sector. That does not mean we should cut public sector funding or privatise sectors. Rather we should seek to grow the private sector and with it the tax base.However, we have seen over the past year what little regard the Conservative Government has for devolving powers. The Brexit process has been abused with powers being taken to Whitehall that should have been devolved. The loss of £. billion of European Structural and Investment Funds is only likely to make the problems faced by disadvantaged areas worse. Local authorities must have their powers and sources of funding guaranteed. Local autonomy with real financial muscle is the only sustainable answer to the regional ide. That is why the Government must support our call to devolve more decision-making power over key levers of economic development including transport, housing and skills. We must do more to tackle regional inequality where you are born should not affect your chance of prosperity.All of this makes clear that it is time for a new People’s Contract. We must end the politics of ision, espoused in ious forms by the Tories, Labour and the SNP and bring the country together. When looking at the referendum vote, we must not only call for a People’s Vote to end the Brexit chaos in the short term, but we must address why people voted leave in the first place. If we are to achieve a fairer, less ided society we must reform our economy so that everyone has the means to get by and the chance to get on.Malcolm Bruce is the Liberal Democrat’s spokesperson for Northern Ireland  Scotland in the House of Lords©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840069.1544086386!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish new car sales motor ahead","story":"Scotland#s car dealers notched up a  per cent rise in new registrations last month, bucking the downward trend seen where in the UK.Industry leaders pointed to a resilient start to December after figures showed , new cars were registered to Scottish addresses during November, up from , in the same month a year earlier.Sandy Burgess, chief executive of the Scottish Motor Trade Association, said: “ has proved to be a very unsettling year for our industry, with the shortage of products that we experienced in our peak selling month of September due to the new WLTP regulations and the effects of that dreaded word Brexit on the consumer confidence.“It really is testimony to the resilience of the Scottish market that we are experiencing growth in the twilight months of the year.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin.

In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

A recent survey of RCGP NImembers found that % of GPs surveyed are concerned their increased workload during the winter months will negatively affect their ability to deliver patient care. The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies. This will be faster and more efficient and will help ensure appointments with a doctor are available for those who need them most.”Patronage to support Drew Nelsons legacyParking problems at local hospital discussed with the Health Trust Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8727531.1543923072!/image/image.jpg","title":"have your say on dromore public realm scheme plans","story":"Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council are inviting members of the public to have their say over plans to improve the public realm in Dromore.Delivered by the council, the Dromore public Realm Scheme will provide high quality improvements within the Town Centre Conservation Area, which includes outer Market Square, Bridge Street and Church Street.The Scheme proposes to enhance the streetscape and offer quality design, utilising natural materials with bespoke details to reflect the town’s unique history and conservation area designation, introducing new pavement treatments, lighting, enhanced shared space, street furniture, signage and decorative features designed to complement the previous works at Dromore Town Hall in the central area of Market Square.The concept design proposals will be on display at Dromore Community Centre until Thursday January , .

She explained: “Normally the Council erects blue plaques at the birth place of famous people from the area but this would be dficult seeing Rosie McCann was a fictional character in a song. “I would suggest the page creator contacts the shadow council.” The song set near Banbridge was written by Cathal McGarveyfrom Ramelton, County Donegal and is sung from the point of view of a young man who chances to meet a charming lady by the name of RosieMcCann, referred to as the “star of the County Down”.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp ian paisley says gallows are being built for theresa mays brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"20m boost for englands","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop. After his try-scoring cameo for the seconds last week, Ross Adair was added to the bench.The first half was a dour affair. Old Wesley scored an early converted try, but the lsquoHinchrsquos blanket defence was able to keep the home side at armrsquosfor the rest of the half andfour penalties from the booming left boot of Peter Nelson kept the visitors in touch.Two well struck penalties from the reliable Rory Stynes gave Old Wesley a narrow - lead at half-time.The arm wrestle continued early in the second half with another exchange of penalties making it - coming up to the hour mark.Ballynahinch were starting to dominate the physical exchanges and were rewarded with a try from replacement Adair as the game moved into the final quarter.He seems to have lost none of his electric pace following hip surgery and the coaching staff will hope to ease him back into the starting line-up as he gets more rugby under his belt.The travelling support were spared a nervy finish when front row replacement Campbell Classon went over following a sustained bout of lsquoHinch pressure on the Wesley line.Nelson completed a fine afternoonrsquos work with the boot with the conversion sealing a - victory.The rest of the results in B fell perfectly for the Co Down men and the top five teams are now separated by just two points, with Ballynahinch right in the mix for promotion once again.Old Wesley Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge receives donation from Amazon Delivery Station  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE charity supporting children and young adults suffering from cancer has received a generous donation from an online delivery company giant.Daisy Lodge welcomed the pound, donation from Amazon Delivery Station and plans to use the donation to provide a child undergoing cancer treatment with short break to Daisy Lodge.Daisy Lodge provides a leline for every young person diagnosed with cancer or living with a parent with the disease during and after treatment so that no family has to face cancer alone.

At the touch of a switch the sun roof and windows open, the seats adjust and the radio aerial goes up and down. The steering is adjustable, the boot opens from a switch on the dash, the lights automatically dip when meeting a car and there is a special lsquoclimate controlrsquo knob. The car also boasts quahonic radio and tapes, a miniature dressing table with lights and a place for a TV.ldquoI was over in England and called in with a friend dealt in American cars. I saw the Cadillac, fancied it and told him I would come back the following week with a view to purchasing it, Jim said.Worth around pound,, Jim reckons it was a real snip and it leaves him in a position to sell his other American car, a  Buick. ldquoComing from the sunshine of state of Florida, there was no rust on it and it was rather frustrating when someone bumped into it after only three weeks on Northern Ireland roads, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick police have warned motorists to lock up their vehicles properly when they go Christmas shopping.The warning comes after recent incidents in the town involving the theft of cars, including one which was taken from a car park at Downtown Shopping Centre.A Ford Cortina car was stolen from Raholp last Wednesday and was later found in a field after crashing through a hedge, while a car was stolen in Market Street and later found in St Patrickrsquos Drive.ldquoA police spokesman said: ldquoThe Christmas period is a time when many cars are stolen.

Most actually attend throughout the course of the year, but quite often it is dferent faces cropping up each month. If only all could come every month, instead of some on occasional months, then we would be a good, strong .The spokesman added: ldquoThere are many issues which can be debated and decisions reached which affect traders and shoppers, so it is hoped that our next meeting will see a revival of interest.NEWCASTLE mdash A petition urging a halt to work on a house in Newcastle was presented to Down councillors at their meeting this week.Signed by  local residents, the petition added fire to Cllr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuersquos claim that the builder had overstepped the restrictions of the original planning permission.After one-and-a-half hours of heated argument the council agreed on a majority decision to ask the planning authority to reconsider the application.Cllr OrsquoDonoghue said the house in King Street was originally given the go-ahead as a two-storey duelling, but had now developed an additional storey. He said the house as being built much higher than it should be and that it was dwarfing the adjacent houses.Cllr Ethel Smyth disagreed strongly with Cllr OrsquoDonoghue and said she felt that the builder was being victimised.KILLOUGH mdash A new pound, housing development in Killough was officially opened last Friday mdash three months ahead of schedule. The development, which consists of  houses, is situated at Castle Street-Main Street on a site which was originally acquired by the old East Down Rural Council.It was eventually transferred to the Housing Executive, but dficulties regarding site boundaries were not resolved until . The existing trees had to be preserved and it was also necessary to preserve the strong street elevation character of the village.The contractor appointed was Polly Brothers, of Downpatrick,and the contractwas  months. However, the contractor has managed to complete the development three months ahead of schedule.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash An exciting new multi-body committee, pledged to crush threats of over-exploitation of Strangford Lough, is expected to be set up within the next three months.The ambitious move is the product of recommendations by a Government working group which was formed two years ago to probe increasing pressures on the lough and surrounding area.The group has concluded that the lough could have massive future potentialit can be preserved in its present unspoilt state. When formed, a management committee will co-ordinate the activities of bodies who have the power to make and implement decisions which influence the future development of the lough.ldquoStrangford Lough is a major resource for the people of Northern Ireland, a spokesman for the Department of Environmentrsquos Conservation Branch said. ldquoIt is indeed fortunate that an area so rich in potential for recreation, tourism and other amenity use, yet so close to a major urbanisation, has remained more or less unspoilt.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh church organist revealed yet another of his musical talents recently when he won the Burnside Cup for top Male Solo Voiceat the youth music festival in Glengormley.Ninegteen year-old Mark Spratt is the organist and choirmaster at First Killyleagh Presbyterian Church and is currently studying music at Stranmillis College in Belfast.This is by no means Markrsquos first success.

His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along. Sadly, children are growing up in a society that is saturated with technology and it appears to be hindering their development in reading and understanding.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland brings to le the best loved of all the Irish hounds in history since Finn McCool and his favourite dog, Bran, strolled these parts.They include the much loved best friend of Manus OrsquoKane, an ancient chieftain from the Glens. His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories. This generation is seeing a lot more children who are hyper active but a book in hand can be a slowing down tool to enjoy in a park or curled up on the sofa.Five Famous Dogs of Ireland would make a great Christmas gt for any child or adult.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do.

The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people. We have a great staff team and Knockevin has many, many family connections with the area which is so lovely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Presentation night at Spa Golf Club  ","story":"FINAL closure on Sparsquos  playing season came on Saturday night when Marian Armstrong and Mark Smyth were named the clubrsquos golfers of the year.It was a remarkable achievement for Marian who claimed the title for a fourth time along with the addition of five other trophies she collected at Sparsquos presentation night.Meanwhile, the Spa team captains will soon be knocking on the door of Mark as they make their selections for the  inter-club matches.While this was his first golfer of the year award, he won three other trophies and over the course of the season has seen his handicap plummet from  to the present .Club captain John Robinson said it had been a great year for Spa for many reasons including the achievements of the ious teams.The Pierce Purcell squad reached the final of the competition while the Sam Rutherford and Rossmore teams also won through to the closing games.He thanked everyone for their tremendous support during his year in office including the council, club officers and staff including the green keepers who, he said, had protected and improved Sparsquos most precious asset.Congratulating all the winners, Mr Robinson said the consistent high quality of play meant it was never easy to win a trophy at Spa Golf Club, but to those who achieved their golfing ambitions in  it was a case of ldquovery well done.Lady captain Carol Shields also thanked the large number of club officers and staff who had made her term in office such an enjoyable experience.She said it had been ldquoan absolute pleasure to work with Mr Robinson, describing him as ldquoa perfect gentlemen who has been a great ambassador for Spa Golf Club.Menrsquos prizewinners: Golfer of the Year , Mark Smyth Winter League trophy, Greg Wilson, Tom Wilson and Julian Kelly Gordon Cup, Robert Gartley Sunbound Cup, Barry Stevens Shaw Cup Doubles, Larry Power and Tom Coburn Lowe Cup, John Munn Holmes Cup, Daniel Connolly Scotia Cup, David Corr John Smith Cup , Bobby Wallace and Mandy Murphy Vice-Presidentrsquos cup, Alan Stevens Mark Gibson Trophy, Gordon Martin Montalto Cup, Alan McNamara Boyd Cup, Mark Smyth Ferguson Cup, Larry Power Eric Dodd Cup, Brian McQueen Wallace Cup, Mark Smyth Joe Mulholland Cup, Chris Donaldson La Carte Trophy, David Kidd Sam Graham Cup, Daniel Connolly Action Press Cup, Daniel Connell H L Hegan Cup, Mark Smyth Plessey Cup, James Walker McIlveen Cup, Alan McNamara Caldwell Cup, Eamon Canavan D J Bell Cup, Brian Blythe Eden na Vadie Cup, Brendan McAlarney Summit Trophy, Sammy Gurr Brian Irvine Cup, Gary Simpson Walter Moore Cup, Alan Stevens Dominic Stratton Cup, Brian McGrillen Forthill Cup, Larry Power Spa Cup, Brian Rea Sunday Jug, Barry Stevens.Ladiesrsquo prizewinners: Golfer of the Year, Marian Armstrong Hugh Gordon Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Challenge Cup, Suzanne McLoughlin Caldwell Cup, Mandy Murphy Lindsay Cup, Lynsey Martin Josie Murray Cup, Gillian Earls Kinray Trophy, Beth Coburn Combat Cancer Trophy, Marian Armstrong  Challenge Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas Slieve Croob Cup, Vivienne Abernethy McRoberts Rose Bowl, Pam Trohear Harvest Cup, Catherine McEvoy Plessey Cup, Ellie Smyth Mr Presidentrsquos Cup , Lisa McCavery Victor and Rita Ginesi Cup, Mandy Murphy Sena Feneran Cup, Marian Armstrong Ladiesrsquo Foursomes Matchplay Trophy, Sally Ann Douglas and Carol Shields Howitt Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Montalto Cup, Alex Murphy Adams Aiken Trophy, Stephanie Rea McIlveen Cup, Gwyneth Cordner Hunter Cup, Marian Armstrong Lowe Cup, Gwyneth Cordner McEvoy Cup, Carol Shields Coburn Cup, Marian Armstrong Sarah Brennan Cup, Mandy Murphy Maureen Hanna Trophy, Gwyneth Cordner Lynne Robinson Trophy , Marian Armstrong..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Seaforde machine on target  ","story":"SO close for the Saints in this first round tie as they had the league leaders on the ropes for much of this match, with it only being decided on the final run of games.After last weekrsquos below par performance against the same opposition, the home side battled better in keeping the games tight as Francie McGreevy lost narrowly - to Derek McCann and Des McAuley lost - to David Boal.The next run of games saw another tight away win, this time Graham Christie beating Collie Brown -.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Because Christmas is not about what we get for ourselves, it is at heart about what we give and what is given.”Funds raised through the Black Santa sit-out are distributed to local charities and organisations, with a small portion going to charities working overseas among those who have little food and few prospects.Donations to the appeal can also be made online at www.belfastcathedral.orgDrug supply evidence ‘was found on laptop’Fatal shooting: Men arrested in connection with killing are released Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

farming.Formerly of Watchill Road, Straid, she is believed to have been the last of her generation of classmates from the Mullaghmossin School at Magheramorne to have now passed away.Mrs Beattie was the only child of James and Mary Millar of Aldfreck townland, Ballycarry, and she attended Mullaghmossin Public Elementary School at Magheramorne, where the principal was Mr DA Hawthorne and Miss Poag was another of her teachers.The family lived close to the main shore road through Magheramorne and she would walk a few miles up the braes from the Millar farm to Ballyedward townland, where she reached the county road which led to the school.It is a sign of the passage of time that the Mullaghmossin School she attended has long since closed down and Magheramorne, which once had at least three schools, no longer has any.The photograph of the classmates of  includes many of her neighbours Jack Millar, Tom Stuart, Tommy Liddle, Margaret Workman, Nancy Smyth, Mary Blair, Adam Semple, Alex Liddle and Sandy Hunter among them.After her school years, Cissie worked on the farm at Aldfreck and, in , she married Hugh Beattie , and moved to Ardboley near Straid, where the couple would raise two sons.Over the years she still maintained friendships which had been forged while she was growing up and living in Magheramorne and she always had a keen interest in the area.She was a former member of Glynn Women’s Institute, but her abiding interest was in the loyal orders, in which her two sons, Arthur and Thomas, were deeply involved over the years.Mrs Beattie was a member of the Old Orange Hall ladies committee at Magheramorne for many years, helping with events such as the installation dinners of the lodge, and also a keen supporter of Magheramorne LOL , RBP  \u2028and Magheramorne Silver Band. Among those who attended her funeral were many members of the local lodges and the Larne Black District Chapter, of which her son Arthur is Worshipful District Master.The funeral service from her son’s residence at Carrickfergus was to Raloo Presbyterian Churchyard, and was conducted at both locations by Rev Ricky Montgomery. A piper led the mourners to the graveside.Mrs Beattie was predeceased by her husband Hugh and her son Thomas, who died in .

She is growing more untrustworthy by the day. “The PM knows that once the withdrawal agreement is in place, Parliament has no say about the backstop.“The introduction of the backstop will be a legally binding arrangement as a result of the agreement, and the ending of the backstop is the responsibility of the EU, as they have the power to block it. “Lets assume parliament did have the ability to decide when the backstop would start she can’t bind any future prime minister as to what they would do. She is making promises she can’t keep.“Also,Parliament was faced with a choice of extending the transition period, which would mean the whole of the UK would stay fully in the EU and make a budget contribution of whatever the EU decided, with no rebate, do you honestly think any parliament is going to vote for that over the backstop “This is total desperation. She will say anything to try and get this deal over the line.“It shows she does not listen. We have explained to her that the only way she is going to change people’s minds is to change the agreement.”The backstop, intended to prevent theof a hard border on the island of Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The government says it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Backstop plan will ‘haunt us for years’, warns Trimble Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Meanwhile, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated that the agreement with Mrs May was the only deal on offer.try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The legally binding international Withdrawal Treaty would remain fundamentally flawed as evidenced by the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice. https:t.co AWDegHqmdash Arlene FosterDecember , DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party opposes Mrs Mayrsquos deal, warned that the amendment would not be enough, tweeting: ldquoDomestic legislative tinkering wonrsquot cut it.ldquoThe legally binding international Withdrawal Treaty would remain fundamentally flawed as evidenced by the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice.The backstop, intended to prevent theof a hard border in Northern Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The Government says it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Under the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop would be introduceda trade deal had not been agreed by both sides by the time the transition period ends in December .However, the transition period could be extended for a maximum of two more years.Prime Minster Theresa May switches on the lights on the Downing Street Christmas tree on Thursday, with the help of children from her constituency The amendment would add provisions for the Commons to ldquoapprove the Governmentrsquos proposed approach, including whether or not an extension to the implementation period should be pursued and parliamentary approval of the commencement of the powers implementing the Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Graham, who sits on the Exiting the EU Committee, told the Press Association it had been clear for some time the backstop ldquowas and remains the thing that gives colleagues the most concern.He said: ldquoWhat we are trying to achieve is something that gets a lot of support from colleagues and that the Government, we hope, will take forward because it will make a real dference to the vote.Earlier on Thursday, ITV had joined the BBC in cancelling plans to broadcast a televised Brexit debate between the Prime Minister and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, after Labour and the Conservatives failed to agree which of the rival offers to accept.Both channels had wanted to host the live programme on Sunday evening, two days before the vote, but it now seems unlikely a head-to-head will go ahead.Mrs May faced calls to postpone Tuesdayrsquos vote, with senior Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, saying he would welcome the vote being deferredno solution could be found to dferences within the party over the backstop.Sir Graham told BBC Tworsquos Newsnight: ldquoI think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop hellipwe were to enter into one in the future.ldquoItrsquos having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing, sothat question can be answered in the course of the next few days then all well and good.ldquoIf it canrsquot, then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.Chief whip Julian Smith acknowledged he faces an ldquouphill challenge to persuade MPs to back Mrs Mayrsquos deal, but insisted ldquoitrsquos all to play for.Speaking to ITV News, Mr Smith insisted there was no ldquoPlan B ready to be unveiledthe PMrsquos proposals are voted down.And former prime minister Tony Blair, asked at a Westminster lunchMrs May should pull the December  vote, said: ldquoPersonally, I donrsquot see what the point is in going

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
