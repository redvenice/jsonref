They can also pose a hazard to other road users if they are lost when the vehicle is moving.\u0027 Drivers in Cumbria’s Barrow-in-Furness were told they could be sanctioned by the council’s licensing committee for having the flags on their cars.The National Private Hire Association said all councils have different policies on taxi drivers displaying flags, but \u0027very few\u0027 ban the practice outright.The government has published new regulations regarding what is and is not allowed regarding flying flags in England.The government says the following flags do not require consent from a local planning authority:Any country’s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensignThe flag of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations or any other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a memberA flag of any island, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village within the United KingdomThe flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom (e) The flag of Saint DavidThe flag of Saint PatrickThe flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United KingdomAny flag of Her Majesty’s forcesThe Armed Forces Day flag.However, the regulations state that all flags must not \u0027obscure, or hinder the interpretation of official road, rail, waterway or aircraft signs, or otherwise make hazardous the use of these types of transport\u0027.      After the law was changed, the rules were relaxed to allow house flags, provided they adhere to certain restrictions:  Flying a flag on a vertical flagpole from the roof of a buildingOnly one flag on a vertical flagpole on the roof of a building is permitted There are no restrictions on the size of flag No restrictions on the size of any character or symbol displayed on the flag, except where a flag is flown within an area of outstanding natural beauty, area of special control, the Broads, conservation area or a National Park (referred to elsewhere as \u0027controlled areas\u0027) where the characters may be no more than 0.75 metres in height (0.3 metres in height in an area of special control) It is permitted to fly one flag on a vertical flagpole on the roof of a building and one flag within the grounds of the building without consent (subject to restrictions below).

Instead, he conned his way into a job with the \u0027British FBI\u0027 hunting fugitives – only to go on the run himself when he was finally found out.The 40-year-old was jailed for 18 months in his absence after gaining UK citizenship by lying to officials.Now the Mail has tracked down the former Scotland Yard and Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) intelligence officer to his bolthole in the seaside resort of Vlore in his homeland.He has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked for – even boasting of his experience with the British police to gain security work in Albania. Ironically, Soca – now part of the National Crime Agency, nicknamed the British FBI – had been investigating Habilaj without realising he was one of its employees.The Albanian arrived in Britain in 1998, and claimed he was a Kosovan named Bekim Ademi. He said his brother had been tortured to death and his father killed by the Kosovan Liberation Army.It\u0027s time to set up migrant processing centres in AFRICA,...Radicalised asylum seekers have murdered or injured more...Share this articleBritish authorities believed him, and he was granted full asylum in November 2001, and citizenship five years later.He was hired by the Metropolitan Police and later Soca, where he worked as an intelligence officer in its London-based \u0027fugitive location team\u0027, helping to find suspected criminals wanted for extradition. He was finally unmasked after checking his own file on a work database of people of interest. Habilaj even called up a photo of himself on his computer screen in front of his boss.Belated checks revealed that he had been born in Albania rather than Kosovo, he never had a brother, and his father was alive and still living in his home town. After he absconded before his trial, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC issued a bench warrant, which instructs police to arrest Habilaj if he is traced. The warrants remain live and legally in force until the suspect is caught or voluntarily returns to face justice.          Habilaj has spent six years there hiding from the UK authorities he once worked forHabilaj was subsequently tried in his absence and jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January 2013 after being convicted of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception and fraud.The sentencing judge Simon Wilkinson said: \u0027He pretended to be a Kosovan and he was an Albanian who made up tales of atrocities to evoke sympathy.\u0027But he has successfully evaded British authorities, and this week we found him overseeing building work on a hotel he manages on the outskirts of Vlore.He also touts himself as a \u0027freelance security consultant\u0027 and boasts to locals of his time working for the British police – without revealing how his time in the UK came to an abrupt end.When approached by the Mail, Habilaj angrily demanded: \u0027Who has sent you? Who was it who brought you here?\u0027 He then ordered one of his building workers to chase us off the premises.Now a father of one, Habilaj boasts online that he has a degree and master\u0027s in criminology, and also claims to have written books on the subject.In a post written in Albanian and posted on Facebook in 2015, he described how he worked for the \u0027highest British agency against crime for almost two years.\u0027He added: \u0027Before that, I did work for the Metropolitan Police in London at its prestigious centre of Scotland Yard. It is an organisation dedicated to perfection and professionalism.

But there are some hard facts that both sides are going to have to confront.ONE is that Theresa May misled the Remainers. A charitable interpretation is she did so unintentionally. A less charitable one is that she mugged them in an effort to save her own skin. But regardless of motive and method, on Tuesday Dominic Grieve and his allies believed their concerns would be fully addressed by a Government amendment, hence the 11th-hour withdrawal of their own. By accident or design, they were duped.RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The Bad Boys of Brexit spoke for Britain...Blow for Philip Hammond as the PM plans to pour billions of...Share this articleWhat is equally apparent is that by tabling such a strongly worded motion, Grieve over-reached himself. Upholding the sacred right of Parliament to scrutinise legislation is one thing. But his text went way beyond that, stipulating that in the event of a deal being rejected by the Commons, the Prime Minister ‘must follow any direction in relation to the negotiation under Article 50’. That was an untenable demand. Setting aside the issue of centuries of constitutional precedent, the idea that MPs could elbow aside Ministers and begin setting the terms of negotiations themselves was utterly impractical.As one Government official scornfully noted: ‘We haven’t started the procurement process for a negotiating table around which it’s possible to fit 650 MPs.’Similarly, by presenting his amendment merely as a sensible contingency, only to be triggered in the event a no-deal scenario, Grieve was himself being uncharacteristically disingenuous.He knew full well that, if adopted, it would have emasculated David Davis and his Brexit negotiating team, giving their EU opposite numbers a clear incentive to simply stonewall the talks and await the cavalry from the Commons. Far from guarding against a no-deal scenario, it would have made a no-deal scenario a certainty.Grieve, Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and their allies believe the end justifies these slightly underhand means. They genuinely think they represent the last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit. And for that they deserve respect, not slurs about their patriotism or their parentage.But they are also wrong. The last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit is Theresa May.The Prime Minister was pilloried last week for her negotiating stance. ‘A farce’ was one of the more polite descriptions from one Brexit-supporting newspaper.Even Downing Street insiders characterise their progress as ‘several steps forward, then a couple back’. But they also – correctly – point out that the overall direction of travel is consistent. Towards a sensible, pragmatic Brexit.For all the criticism she has received from Tory Remainers over the past few days, Mrs May has demonstrated time and again she too is prepared to stand up to her hard-Brexit zealots. Over the orce bill. Over the transition period. Over ECJ rulings during that transition. Over a customs arrangement. Indeed, not just stand up to them, but face them down, as Boris Johnson’s perennial frantic redrawing of his ‘red lines’ attests.But if the Prime Minister is undermined this week, then she will no longer be in a position to stand up to anyone. At that point a leadership challenge would almost certainly be mounted, one that if successful would result in the election of a far more Eurosceptic Tory leader.Or worse. The removal of Theresa May might give a brief moment of satisfaction to the Remain and hard-Brexit factions. But it would not break the Commons deadlock.And that is the real danger presented by the Grieve amendment. We are now on the cusp of entering a period of parliamentary purgatory. The Prime Minister attempts to negotiate a deal. The Commons rejects it. A new Prime Minister is dispatched to negotiate a new deal. That in turn is rejected. Tory – and moderate Labour – fears of a Corbyn government prevent a dissolution of the House and an early Election. And so the cycle repeats itself. At which point the Government ceases governing.          Nicky Morgan is one of the Tory rebels The country deserves better than this. As does Theresa May. Twelve months ago her premiership was over. The horrific fire at Grenfell, and catastrophic Election result, had created a perfect storm. In a matter of months Corbyn and his legion of White Walkers would be marching up Downing Street.BUT with the tenacity and bloody-mindedness that have become her trademark, the PM has stabilised her position. Labour’s lead in the polls has been reversed. The Corbynites’ crude attempt to leverage the Grenfell tragedy into a transitional political moment has failed. And, as we report today, a dramatic cash injection for the NHS demonstrates she is finally throwing off her instinctive caution, delivering the kind of major ‘visible from space’ policy announcements Ministers have been crying out for.Then there is Brexit. It has been an ugly process. But the Government is inching forward. David Davis has won the argument for publication of a Brexit White Paper. It will be signed off at next month’s Chequers away-day, after which it will form the basis of Mrs May’s official negotiating position.That’s if the Remain rebels stand with her. Last week the Prime Minister hurt them. But she is the Prime Minister, and they are not.

He is understood to have told police he had sex with the teenage British tourist, but said it was consensual.

Reeco Hackett-Fairchild, pictured, made his debut for Charlton last year scoring twicePolice and court officials could not be reached for comment.The incident which sparked the three arrests is said to have happened at a hotel in Cala de Bou near the party resort of San Antonio after the alleged victim and a female friend met them at a bar and agreed to go back to their hotel.A Spanish National Police spokesman said after the first two arrests: \u0027National Police officers arrested two English men on Tuesday in San Jose in Ibiza as the suspected authors of a sex attack.\u0027The parents of the 19-year-old victim, who is also British, reported the incident to police.\u0027It would appear the victim and a female friend of hers who were on holiday in Ibiza with the victim\u0027s parents, went to San Antonio on Monday afternoon and met several lads from a football team in the UK in a bar there.\u0027Both women agreed to go back with the some of the men to the hotel they were staying at, in the municipality of San Jose.\u0027Once they were in a room, one of the youngsters was allegedly sexually attacked by one of the players, while a second took hold of her and a third recorded her on a mobile phone.\u0027After the incident, the visibly affected victim and her friend left the hotel to go back to the woman\u0027s parents.\u0027The victim\u0027s parents quickly suspected something was wrong and after discovering what had happened, went to speak to the National Police.\u0027National Police officers went to the hotel where those allegedly responsible for the sex attack were staying, and subsequently arrested two men.\u0027The police investigations are ongoing and further arrests in the coming hours have not been ruled out.\u0027The spokesman confirmed the third arrest on Thursday morning, describing the detainee as a 26-year-old British national.A well-placed police source said at the time: \u0027The third man held is the suspected sex attacker.\u0027One of the two men held on Tuesday is suspected of holding the woman down during the alleged sex attack and the other of recording it.\u0027The judicial investigation - which is taking place behind closed doors - will now seek to determine the involvement of each of the three men in the incident and clarify if police have been given an accurate version of events by the alleged victim, her friend and the three men.The female holidaymaker was asked to ratify her original police statement to the courts. It is believed she has already done so.Local reports earlier this week said one of the men - thought to be Ahearne-Grant - told police and the judge he was in another room with the alleged victim\u0027s friend and got involved in an altercation with the other two men after hearing noise and going to investigate.Cala de Bou, which is in the municipality of San Jose, is a popular location for tourists looking to stay somewhere quieter than San Antonio but within easy reach of the brash party resort.It is just seven miles from the airport and home to a number of hotels and short-stay holiday apartments.Ahearne-Grant, born in Greenwich is a forward who signed with League One side Charlton as a 17-year-old in September 2014.He has made more than 60 appearances with the club in Championship and League One football and has played for England at U17, U18 and U19.Redbridge-born Hackett-Fairchild made his professional debut with Charlton in August last year, and hit the net twice in 12 appearances.He has previously spent time with Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge and Dulwich Hamlet.A Charlton Athletic spokesman said: \u0027The club have been made aware and are looking into this matter.\u0027Due to the ongoing investigation we will not be commenting any further at this stage.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/14/4D2F5A1000000578-0-image-m-28_1528896411300.jpg","title":"Novelty toy inventor designed inflatable bogus speed cameras","story":"    London-based entrepreneur Shed Simove with his newest novelty invention: an inflatable speed cameraA novelty toy inventor who designed an inflatable fake speed camera has been warned he could be jailed for seven years if his gadget causes car crashes.Wacky entrepreneur Shed Simove is  known for his gimmicks, including his bestselling book \u0027What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex\u0027 - consisting of 200 blank pages.But the London-based former Big Brother producer has been told his latest curious creation could land him in trouble with the law.Mr Simove commissioned a factory in China to manufacture his joke  speed camera, dubbed the FAKESO, and planned to sell them in stores for £30 each.Now officers have warned him he could fall foul of the Road Traffic Act 1988 if his blow-up yellow devices distract drivers and cause accidents.When fixed to a drainpipe the bogus cameras look surprisingly realistic - but they could prove hazardous if motorists start taking notice of them rather than the road.Elderly man on mobility scooter causes havoc on dual...‘This should be fun’: Thrillseeker slides down concrete...Share this articleMr Simove had thought they would appeal to drivers with a sense of humour and anyone trying to get cars to slow down outside their home.But his plans to start selling the novelty item have now been put on hold and he is waiting for legal advice on whether he can press ahead.

As an atheist, I found it difficult to square my father’s intelligence with his embrace of what to me were religious fairy stories.Love and admiration aren’t synonymous, and can be at odds. The awe we had drilled into us was distancing. My father was already remote – often out of town, impatient when the dratted kids needed to pee, and distracted at dinner – from which he bolted, the better to get back to work.

Now the challenge of keeping pace is walking that slowly. Of course, I’d rather his body decay than his mind. Fortunately, he can still rail cogently against Donald Trump, and I’ve laid down the law: he has to live long enough to see the back of that guy in the White House.I’m not grateful for his infirmity, but I am grateful for its effect. There’s a new tenderness to our relationship, on both sides.Once unheard of, he confides in me. My mother’s massive stroke means he’s often lonely.He needs me now, if only, as he says, for ‘someone to complain to’. He’s mortal. I prefer my father mortal.

Dagmar Hochová took photographs that captured all of the hopes and fears of the long postwar struggle for freedom in her country, which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.Hochová was born in 1926 and lived most of her life in Prague until her death in 2012. Though her pictures were sometimes overtly political – the young, ostracised Václav Havel, at home the “march of silence” against the Russian invasion – Hochová became best known as a photographer of children. This was partly a question of expedience. Childhood was one of the few aspects of the city’s life that was effectively beyond the censor’s control. Hochová’s camera sought out the mischief and spirit of Czech kids playing in the streets. The exuberance she was drawn to was no doubt a statement of subversive intent at a time when freedom of expression was outlawed – there was also plenty of pure innocent joy.This picture, part of the first UK retrospective of Hochová’s work, captures all of that youthful Bohemian spirit. It was taken on a bridge over the Vltava River in 1959. After the Russian coup in 1948 there had been long years of Stalinist purges of artists and agitators, and the creation of all the grey apparatus of a police state, but that world seems far removed from these two girls.

With her novels, she prefers to wait for her characters to introduce themselves to her, and slowly develop a trust and a friendship with them. Sometimes, however, external events force her hand. One of these was the election of the isive Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi as Indian prime minister in May 2014.At the time, Roy had been working for about seven years on her second novel, the successor to her stunning, 1997 Booker prize-winning debut, The God of Small Things. But Modi’s victory forced her to “really put down the tent pegs” on what would eventually become The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. “It was just a moment of shock for people like me,” says Roy, twirling an elegant, checked scarf around her neck like spaghetti around a fork. “For so many years, I’d been trying to yell from the rooftops about it and it was absolutely a sense of abject defeat and abject despair. And the choice was to get into bed and sleep for five years, or to really concentrate on this book. I didn’t feel like writing any more essays, although I did write one, but I felt like everything I had to say had been said. It was time to accept defeat.”It may have felt like defeat to Roy, but the arrival of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness last year was a cause of celebration for nearly everybody else. The novel, now out in paperback, opens in Delhi, in what appears to be the 1950s, and introduces us to Anjum, a Muslim hijra or transgender woman. In the second part of the book, the story moves to Kashmir and we follow a new protagonist, Tilo, an architect who becomes involved with a group of Kashmiri independence fighters. The strands eventually converge, but along the way dozens of odd characters dip in and out of proceedings. It’s not always immediately clear what purpose they are serving it’s only at the end of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness that you realise what an extraordinary and visceral state‑of‑the-nation book Roy has created.“What I wanted to know was: can a novel be a city?” says Roy. “Can you stop it being baby food, which can be easily consumed? So the reader also has to deal with complexities that they are being trained not to deal with.”Much of Roy’s own experience feeds into The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, not least the fact that she studied to be an architect and has campaigned for Kashmiri independence. For herself, she realised very quickly that architecture was not for her. “I graduated but I didn’t actually build anything, because I wasn’t really cut out to be making beautiful homes for wealthy people or whatever,” she says, smiling. “I had too many arguments with my bosses. Kept getting sacked for bad behaviour. For insolence!”So finding her way to writing was probably for the best then? “It started with knowing very early that I couldn’t have a boss!”Even now, at the age 56, Roy manages to retain a healthy rebellious streak. We meet in London, at the offices of her publisher, Penguin Random House, a couple of days after the end of the Hay festival. I notice she hadn’t appeared at the festival and wondered if there was a reason. There was: Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns everything from steel plants to tea company Tetley, sponsored various events at Hay under the banner “Pioneering with Purpose”. Roy has in the past been critical of it as one of the “mega-corporations” that run modern India. She didn’t want to be a hypocrite.Roy, who lives in Delhi, instead wanted to use her time in London to confirm the publication of her collected nonfiction work. In the 20 years between her two novels, these projects have occupied most of her time. She has written powerfully about government dams, the 2002 Gujarat massacre, and spent almost three weeks walking through the forests of central India with Naxalites, a Maoist group that seeks to defend the rights of the tribes whose land, abundant in minerals, is being developed. It is a considerable body of work: so much so that when the essays are released next year – with the title My Seditious Heart – the book will run to more than 1,000 pages.Roy describes her nonfiction as “urgent interventions”, but ever since Modi came to power she is mostly drawn to writing fiction. It seems unlikely, then, that we’ll have to wait another 20 years for a new novel. “Who knows, but I hope not!” she says. “Because I really have so enjoyed writing fiction again. But I must say that, the times are so uncertain, there’s going to be a very, very hard year in India and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I can’t ever say in advance what I’ll be doing …”She shakes her head and laughs, “It’s a highly unplanned life.”Lionel ShriverAuthorDo you ever worry that your work as an activist detracts – or at least distracts – from your fiction, and are you concerned that sticking your neck out politically changes the way readers and critics respond to that fiction?I have always quarrelled with this word “activist”. I think it’s a very new word and I don’t know when it was born, but it was recently. I don’t want to have a second profession added to writing. Writing covers it. In the old days, writers were political creatures also, not all, but many. It was seen as our business to be writing about the world around us in different ways. So I don’t feel threatened or worried about that. For me, my fiction and my nonfiction are both political. The fiction is a universe, the nonfiction is an argument.What I do worry about is the fact that writers have become so frightened of being political. The idea that writers are being reduced to creators of a product that is acceptable, that slips down your throat, which readers love and therefore can be bestsellers, that’s so dangerous. Today, for example in India, where majoritarianism is taking root – and by majoritarianism, I don’t just mean the government, I mean that iniduals are being turned into micro-fascists by so many means. It is the mobs and vigilantes going and lynching people. So more than ever, the point of the writer is to be unpopular. The point of the writer is to say: “I denounce you even if I’m not in the majority.”Nina StibbeAuthorWhich Beatle is your favourite and why?John Lennon. I can say that in my sleep! Why? Because I always felt that there was a sadness that was wrapped with brilliance. And, this is not the reason that I love him – I also love the way he looks.

I was like, “Fuck!” Although it was really before my time, but still…George MonbiotWriter and environmentalistIn a world racked by climate breakdown, ecological collapse and the marginalisation of billions, what gives you hope?One of my books of essays is dedicated to “those who have learned to orce hope from reason”. So being unreasonable is the only way that we can have hope. I am often among people who battle every day, but when you’re in there with them it’s not all grim. These are people who have their backs to the wall and are fighting for survival, but so much of the time they spend laughing at stupid things.For example, when I was inside the forests of central India with the comrades, one night everyone was asleep and I saw this guy typing something on his solar-powered computer. So I said: “What are you doing?” And he said: “Oh, I’m issuing a denial. You know, if all our denials were published, they would run into several volumes.” So I said: “What’s the most ridiculous denial you’ve ever had to issue?” And he said in Hindi: “No brother, we didn’t hammer the cows to death.”The story was that the current sitting chief minister had promised in his election campaign that, if he won the elections, every rural household would get a cow. So once he won, to pretend to deliver on his promise, they rounded up all these elderly cows and then they were subcontracted to people who were expected to deliver them to these far-flung households in the forests of indigenous peoples. Some of them just killed the cows halfway through and then said the Maoists did it. It served so many purposes: they didn’t have to bother delivering them, and the Maoists come out of it as anti-Hindu.So there’s often a graveyard humour and a steely resilience, and I believe that the only way – if at all – the machine can be pushed back is through these resistances. And I’m on the side of the line with them.Eve EnslerPlaywrightWhat reader’s response to The Ministry of Utmost Happiness surprised you the most?Ha-ha, there are several. One is that it’s a book that doesn’t pretend to universalise anything or conceptualise anything. It’s a book of great detail about a place. So the first thing that surprised me was that it has been translated into 46 languages – that it is being read in Vietnam, in Georgia. It was never designed to be that kind of an easy read. I got a letter from someone in Palestine the other day who said: “Thank you for making space for the poetics of other languages in your book.” That was amazing because the book is imagined in more than one language. And given the climate we have in India right now, I’m happy to say that it’s been pirated and even being sold to me at the traffic lights. For half-price!Wendy DonigerUS Indologist whose book The Hindus: An Alternative History was recalled by its publisher, Penguin India, in 2014Do you think it is possible for writers and publishers to join forces to find ways to oppose prosecutions for blasphemy (or “offending” religious feelings) under laws like Indian penal code section 295A? Or at least to change the charge from a criminal to a civil offence?If we’re talking India in particular, I feel that it is possible. I know Wendy Doniger’s publishers let her down very badly. It was very wrong what they did, because they were not even taken to court. It was just this crazy man who makes a business out of going after people in this way. This is the way the criminal justice system is used in India, as harassment. So they could have backed her, but they didn’t.At the moment what is happening in India is that censorship is being outsourced to the mob. Some person comes out and says: “Oh you’re not showing rajput in a good light,” or any community starts feeling that they can burn down cinema halls, they can stop a film release, and it’s all being allowed. In the same way, writers have been killed and shot and threatened. The government can try to act as if it’s not involved, but its involvement is in protecting the mobs. It’s a question that leads to many questions and Wendy Doniger has suffered.Shobha RaoAuthorWhen did you know your childhood was over?It’s not over yet! It should never be over for writers. The people I fear most are the people who I look at and I can’t imagine what kind of a child they were. Because of the circumstances in which I was born and how I lived, I had to be in some ways a pretty adult child and I would like at least some part of me to be a pretty childish adult.Kate HudsonGeneral secretary of CNDIt’s 20 years since India’s Pokharan nuclear weapons tests. At the time, you powerfully and convincingly demolished the claims that such weapons were deterrents to war. Now the narrative from the White House is one of “usable” nukes. How can we defeat this drive towards global self-destruction, and how can a new movement be built?I don’t know what the answer to this question is. But one thing that’s truly on my mind now, and I know it will sound paranoid – but I think we do need to be paranoid – is artificial intelligence. Perhaps AI can do better surgery than surgeons, write better poetry than poets and better novels than novelists. But what it does is make the human population almost surplus: it makes it unnecessary. One argument is that it will be the end of work and the beginning of play that people can be looked after. But people could be looked after now, as we know there’s enough surplus to do that, and it doesn’t happen.When human beings become surplus, that’s where these smart nukes and chemical and biological warfare – these things that are genocidal – begin to really worry me. Because I do see a time when the masters of the universe will decide that the universe is a better place without most of the population. Artificial intelligence is a way of becoming the perfect human being, which fascists have always thought about: the supreme human being. If you can think of that, if that is your goal, then certainly you can think of the other. I worry about it.Ali SmithAuthorI am a fan of all your writing in all its forms, but what is it that the novel makes possible for us that no other form of writing does?And there are things it can do. There’s a quote from James Baldwin in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness: “And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.” So if you were to take out the political milestones in this book and just do nonfiction about them, they would not be what they are. Only a novel can tell you how caste, communalisation, sexism, love, music, poetry, the rise of the right all combine in a society. And the depths in which they combine. We have been trained to “silo-ise”: our brains specialise in one thing. But the radical understanding is if you can understand it all, and I think only a novel can.Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell Directors of Grafton ArchitectsYou have said that literature is not about issues, that it is about the world, about everybody, that literature is a monumental, profound, beautiful and complicated thing. Would you apply the same values in your contemplation of architecture?Yes, of course. I’m a student of architecture, and if I had to choose a profession again I would choose architecture, because I do believe it’s about everything. One of the people who made me want to become an architect was Laurie Baker he was British but had lived in India all his life. He used to do what was called no-cost architecture, where you pay a lot of attention to material and where it came from: he was so against the idea of his buildings living for ever. I learned from him that beautiful architecture is not directly proportional to how much it costs or how much money you put into it. So for me, it’s a very fundamental and beautiful art, certainly extremely profound in terms of how you should be thinking about it.With regards to your fiction, would you be able to describe the balance between research, autobiography and imagined worlds? How important is it to you?James CorcutI don’t do research. What generally happens is I begin to get curious about something for no reason and then I just find it impossible to contain and I’ve written nonfiction. But especially in the novel, these things just settle in you and you become like a sedimentary rock. The characters come by and it’s almost like you’re walking down the street and someone catches your eye and you meet them again and then you become friends. It’s a bit like that. One of the ways in which I write, especially when I write fiction, is just that I wait. And something just comes knocking at your door. You have to be open to it. You have to allow it in, more than pursue it.I’m very much part of those worlds that I describe. So sometimes it might be really autobiographical and I don’t know. When you’re open to allowing these characters in, everything is autobiographical, no? Esthappen in The God of Small Things says: “If in a dream you’ve eaten fish, does it mean you’ve eaten fish?” For me, those worlds are all very osmotic: experience, autobiography, imagination, understanding. And that’s why it all needs to mix and settle and it’s not segmented.My friends and I often debate “the best Bookers”. Mine happen to be, in no particular order: Disgrace, The God of Small Things and Midnight’s Children. I’d like to think that you, too, have these “pub conversations” – so, what’s your favourite Booker novel, and why?Viren Mistry I don’t have these conversations, because I don’t feel like thinking about books in this way. Books are unique and so I don’t think of them hierarchically. I understand that people need to give prizes, but it’s so particular to you and I don’t even think of “Booker books” to begin with.You have been fiercely expressing your disagreements with the state, irrespective of political parties in office. Have you ever wished to go into electoral politics? If yes, why haven’t you yet? If no, why?Anand AaniNo. It’s such an important place and time in which to be a writer, where you’re not burdened by the idea of soliciting people’s support. Where often it’s so important to stand alone, to be a person who expresses themselves very clearly on certain things. So I can only see it as a great defeat if I really wanted to come into politics or stand for elections or ask people to like me or vote for me. It’s just not in my DNA to do that. I cannot even conceive of becoming a person who needed to change something about the way they were dressing or thinking or speaking to get someone to vote for me. To suddenly start going to a temple and pretending I’m really religious because I want to win the Hindu vote, I can’t do it! I’d be terrible at it!You once said: ‘Each time I write an essay I get into so much trouble I promise never to do it again.’ What was the last essay you wrote and did you get into any trouble?Cate LoboWell, the last essay I wrote was actually about the trouble, it was called My Seditious Heart. But previous to that, I wrote a piece called Professor, POW about GN Saibaba. He is a professor of literature, paralysed in his lower body, and he was thrown in prison and sentenced to life for… I don’t know what all the reasons are, but he’s accused of being a Maoist and working against the state. He’s still in prison now and is in a bad state.I’ve known him for a long time and when I wrote Professor, POW I was charged with criminal contempt of court. I have a long history of contempt of court, being accused of contempt of court – I’ve also gone to prison for it. So I had to appeal to the supreme court to quash it, which they have not done, but they have put it in cold storage. It’s so tiring, but it’s OK for me. Because of the work I do, I have lawyers who are friends. I have the money to fly to the other city where the appeal is being heard and hire a hotel and stay there. But let’s say you’re a young journalist or a young writer who doesn’t have that – what do you do? You’re finished! So the idea is: “Let’s make this an example, let’s break up the stride, then the mobs will come there and will shout at you.” It just goes on and on.How do you write the parts that make us cry? And do you cry when you read them back?Brendan RossWriting and crying are things that people do differently. For me, I’m always writing: when I’m walking, when I’m shopping, when I’m thinking. There’s a processing that’s going on – and the heartbreak is close to the surface all the time. But there’s a difference between the retelling of a tragedy and when you sometimes don’t actually tell it, but what it reflects is even more tragic. So often when I think about things, yes, I do cry, but I shift between laughter and tears and anger. That’s what I meant about never stopping to be a child: you have to always be in touch with those feelings.What female writers have inspired and influenced you?Sofía GuerreroIt seems that The Ministry of Utmost Happiness suggests it’s possible to live in a world that is carved out of, yet also away from, the degradations of a class- and caste-ridden (also ableist, homophobic etc) society. Is such a world possible only in novels, or do you think it’s possible in real life?Alpana SharmaI don’t think that The Ministry of Utmost Happiness should be viewed as a manifesto, that it’s proposing an alternative way of living. It’s a story about certain particular and unique people who find their way in a unique way. By having these people, you are shining a light on what society is really like and the fact that you can’t ignore caste and gender and all of that. It’s really about that.What moments in your life give you solace?Sylvie MillardThe moment when I just put my cheek on my dog’s tummy. I have two of them, and one has a considerable tummy, but the other is slightly more delicate. Both of them used to be strays. I found them. One of them, her mother was killed by a car on the road outside my house. Her eyes were closed and she was so small and I had to feed her with a dropper and now she’s huge. The other one I stole. I’d see her tied to a lamppost night and day on this road, and I just took her. Later, I told the people that I’d taken her, and they said: “OK, we didn’t want her.”• Arundhati Roy’s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is published in paperback by Penguin (£8.99).

Living standards have flatlined and public spending has been cut. People are anxious, frustrated and angry. The only real surprise is that they are not angrier. That, though, may only be a matter of time, because rapid technological change is happening at a time when the global economy seems fragile and many people feel they are getting a raw deal. These are perfect conditions for an age of insecurity.So far, the response from mainstream parties has been unimpressive. Those expressing concerns about the hollowing out of industrial communities by globalisation have been lectured about the benefits of free trade. Those who have voiced anxiety about migration have been called racists. Those who wonder how they will make a living when the robots arrive have been branded Luddites.In his new book, Charles Dumas says: “It is vital that the label ‘populism’ does not become a sneer. To be sure, demagogues have readily exploited widespread discontent with quack remedies. But centrist politicians and commentators have shown equally widespread lack of empathy with the legitimate grievances that underlie this neo-Luddism. The way combined globalisation, technology, demographics and financial imbalances are developing could only too easily aggravate neo-Luddism in future, as well as false ethnic andor regional isions.”What’s more, there is less chance of a child born into a poor family making good than there once was. The OECD found that upward mobility for people with lower educated parents tended to increase for children born between 1955 and 1975 but stagnated for those born thereafter. “Families and communities in many countries seem to be trapped on the bottom rungs of the ladder.” Nor, according to the OECD is there a trade-off between inequality and social mobility. Scandinavian countries have not been immune from populism but they are the most equal and they also have the most social mobility.A speech last week from Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, helps explain why that is.There were technological advances and periods of strong growth pre-1750, but times of rapid expansion were almost exactly matched by episodes of contraction. The big change since 1750 has not been that the upswings have been stronger, it is that downswings have been less frequent and less painful. Growth depends on two things: new ideas and institutions that cushion the impact of recessions.The three previous industrial revolutions all caused technological disruption and led to significant job replacement. They also led to income inequality, because those with the greatest skills were able to stay one step ahead of the machine. Workers did not always benefit fully or immediately from the pick-up in productivity associated with periods of technological change, which were often long as well as difficult for those affected.But institutions developed to ensure that the fruits of growth were shared. These took many forms: Haldane name checks compulsory schooling, the spread of higher education, the development of central banks, the emergence of credit unions and friendly societies, the arrival of trade unions to represent workers, and the creation and expansion of the welfare state during the 20th century. He thinks the coming technological change could be the biggest of the lot, because artificial intelligence means humans will no longer have the cognitive playing field to themselves.“The fourth Industrial Revolution will expand the range of ideas, perhaps more than any of its predecessors. It may also expand the range of workers who suffer its side-effects, perhaps more than so any of its predecessors. In the past, new institutions have emerged to cushion this painful transition, limiting the recessionary hit to societies. Historically, doing so appears to have the key to sustainable growth.” Jobs will be created as well as lost, but even if higher unemployment caused by technological change is avoided there could still be rising wage inequality, a fall in labour’s share of national income and social unrest. Doubtless new institutions will eventually be created to help deal with the fourth Industrial Revolution. In the meantime, it would be a good idea to breathe new life into some of the institutions developed as a response to the first three: progressive taxation, investment in education, cradle-to-grave welfare states, and collective bargaining.Populism and Economics – Charles Dumas, Profile books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e30960d24ac857708b3e56cb669479c71d385e3/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b87d0d345f3f2edf8eade1bab7148f","title":"opec summit saudi arabia russia oil cartel","story":"At the meeting Vienna, Opec members will debate whether to lift the 18-month-old production cap to stabilize pricesAs the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) prepares to meet on June 22, its members are looking at a very different world than just a few years ago.The massive oil supply glut – and rock bottom prices – is gone. The global economy is stronger, fossil-fuel energy demand is at a record high, and the nuclear deal that allowed Iran, an Opec member, to start selling oil again is in tatters. After falling to sub-$30 a barrel in early 2016 for Brent, the global benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, oil prices have risen to about $76 and $67 a barrel respectively.Crude oil demand now outstrips supply, and Opec members will debate whether to lift the 18-month-old production cap to stabilize prices. It’s believed Saudi Arabia wants to pump more, as does Russia, a key non-Opec member, but poorer Opec members would rather see prices continue to rise.Agreements are never easy for the oil cartel, but oil-market watchers say even if the cap is lifted, spare global capacity to produce more oil is limited, which means for the first time in many years the oil market may be at the mercy of potential supply shocks or geopolitical tensions rattling prices.After surprising discipline by Opec members to hold to the cap, more oil is coming to the market. That’s why Brent and WTI prices are off their May highs of around $80 and $73, said analyst Scott Roberts of Invesco Fixed Income. Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were already pumping more than before, curbing the recent rally.Those announcements show where Opec may be leaning, Roberts said, but cartel confabs are complex. Opec members may be irritated that it appears that the US and Saudi Arabia have been discussing policy before the meeting. Trump complained at least twice, on 20 April, and then again on 13 June, about oil prices. Given the Saudi’s raised output in May, it may have appeared that the Saudis was responding to Trump’s tweet.Roberts said Opec could boost production by about a million barrels day fairly rapidly, but several Opec countries have problems. Venezuelan production continues to decline it’s unknown how much Iranian production might be lost because of sanctions and in Angola, Libya and Nigeria production is also crimped. And some Opec members want prices to go higher to help them meet their country’s budgets. Thus, there are limits to how much extra oil the cartel can be called on to supply.US shale producers can step up to meet any supply deficit, but Roberts and Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at the Price Futures Group, said it takes time for them to increase output because of the nature of shale mining. Roberts said production from the Permian Basin, the biggest shale deposit, is being curbed because of infrastructure bottlenecks to get oil delivered to refineries.Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which focuses on energy markets, said those bottlenecks could last another 18 months, another aspect Opec members will likely take into consideration at the meeting.What Opec doesn’t want to do is hurt demand, Thummel said. Significant drops in US and global oil inventories show consumer demand is at record highs, spurred by the lower oil prices and now a stronger global economy, said Roberts and Michael Cohen, analyst at Barclays. Going into the second half of the year, demand will likely to continue to increase with the summer driving season ahead, Thummel said.Roberts said the $4 a gallon on a retail basis “is a psychological point people keep in mind”.With demand currently outpacing supply, it leaves the market in a situation it hasn’t been in for some time: susceptible to price shocks. Although the market probably won’t revisit the huge price swings from yesteryear because the US is now such a big producer, Thummel said, it’s still a possibility.Flynn said the markets really aren’t ready for the potential impact of geopolitical threats or outright output disruption. “If you look at the lack of spare capacity from Opec and you compare it to demand, there’s just no room for error. What if we have another hurricane,” he said, referring to Hurricane Harvey, which took out refinery capacity in Houston and sent gasoline prices soaring for a while last fall.Cohen said the market has already priced in a slight rise in output – say 700,00 to 800,000 barrels per day. If there’s a lack of consensus about upping output, that could be a bullish sign and push Brent prices to average around $80 to $85 for the year, above current levels.There’s one other factor to consider, Roberts said, and that’s the US dollar. A stronger greenback weighs on oil since it’s denominated in dollars. That could keep a cap on prices and limit how much money Opec makes at higher production levels.“A strong dollar hurts Opec, no doubt about it,” Roberts said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5b831d7ef20cb610bbdf3a53e97fbb843a85e/0_308_4780_2868/master/4780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5363ac4d661202d32abb5789876611b3","title":"alpha males surely there is a better term how about tossers","story":"From the City to politics to advertising, macho behaviour reigns uncheckedAnnouncing its latest report, the Commons Treasury committee headlined its conclusions “Abolish ‘alpha-male’ culture to encourage progression of women in finance”.Given that equal access to massive City bonuses has yet to be widely understood as a priority, while the international threat from high-profile alpha maleness is already ranked at severe, this turned out to be a brilliant bit of PR. It sounds so promising. How quickly does the Treasury committee think we can eradicate alpha maleness? By which method? Would it be suitable for any type of infestation? Most important, would it work on David Davis?Moreover, given that the relevant men are being urged to reform, you could argue that calling them “alpha males” – only a few steps down from masters of the universe and several up from silverbacks and big beasts – might be less effective in achieving behavioural change than some less obviously awed-sounding descriptor. Git? Or maybe tosser, being more insistently male, better captures, for instance, the kind of modern Bank of England manager who, recruiting from a shortlist of four women and one man, unerringly picks the man.Admittedly, some will find the term too imprecise, too binary, possibly on the reductive side, for use by a parliamentary committee engaged in an important quest for workplace equality. Aren’t there more kinds of men in the world than\u0026nbsptossers and non-tossers? Where do manspreaders fit in? But the same surely applies to the term “alpha male”, with its insulting proposal that all the others are betas. What possessed the committee to endorse terminology so cherished by the world’s strongman enthusiasts? As it is, they echo, for instance, Nigel Farage excusing Trump’s rapey molestation stories as “alpha-male boasting”.It’s not just that the comparison is, as applied above, unfair to apes. More unhelpfully, it reflects back to the male referent, his valuation of his own eminence. The committee might as well have added that, as Farage once complimented “brilliant” Putin, if you poke the deputy governor of the Bank of England with a stick, he will respond.Of course, when finance committee member Rushanara Ali questioned witnesses about “alpha male” workplaces, “this culture of winning at all costs”, she did not mean it kindly. As deployed by Ali, and by countless men equally resistant to this idea of masculinity, “alpha male” is hardly less suggestive of deviance than “toxic masculinity”, “man child” or “narcissist”.But, as demonstrated by some prominent tossers, the quality of being not so much indifferent to criticism, as viewing it as a form of potency-guarantor, is as reliable an indicator of this personality type as an enthusiasm for Ayn Rand, a cartoon handshake or a disgust for unimpressed – probably menopausal – women. Look at the obsession of the “alt-right” with “cucks” or, more locally, at the valedictory column in which the Daily Mail’s departing hominid, Paul Dacre, dwells as boastfully on the loathing he inspires as on his important admirers: “I suffer my critics’ obloquy with pride.”Anyone still wondering how much men in financial services mind being called alpha males by Nicky Morgan should probably go back to the viral G7 photograph in which prestige – Angela Merkel – confronts dominance – Donald Trump, seated in what was described as the “alpha male” position. Smirking, legs spread, arms crossed, the president shows Merkel and a group of similarly appalled men whom (even if Macron did hurt his hand) he unquestionably considers beta, that their objections only harden his asinine – or should that be swinish? – resolve. Although analysts have long favoured dominant monkey behaviour as a parallel for the powerful human male’s, Trump’s thundering greed, idiocy, aggression,\u0026nbspimmaturity, cruelty, priapism, misogyny, destructiveness, egotism and impulsiveness indicate, as never before, its limitations as chief comparator, a sufficiently abject\u0026nbspanimal alternative having yet to evolve.Supposing there were real insights to be gained, following publication, in 1982, of Frans De Waal’s Chimpanzee Politics, from comparisons between powerful men and primates, it’s unfortunate that the relevant domineering, bullying or simply preposterous human conduct thereby got itself dignified as“alpha male”, in a borrowing from primatology, rather than, say, “apelike”, “chimpanzoid”, “bestial”.How differently we might then have viewed Martin Sorrell, recently mentioned in connection with a sex-buying claim (which he denies) and bullying, formerly a “pretty unique alpha male”. Ditto Philip Green, back when this rude bully (or “sex god” to Michael Gove) was “the archetypal alpha male”. On the left, Alastair Campbell, in his press monstering days, wowed even victims: “Alpha male… he could be a bully – but you can’t survive five minutes in that job without sometimes being a bully.” Substitute chimp (assuming tosser is out of the question) in each case and we might have learned something.For aspiring tossers, a range of study aids includes Putin’s walk and\u0026nbsphints on the wide-legged “power stance” hilariously attempted by George Osborne and Sajid Javid, though never by Barack\u0026nbspObama, one of the legions of men to have demonstrated that power is not, however unlikely it might currently appear, the monopoly of thugs. Although, if we persist in calling them alpha males, that can’t but help."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebd2baee4e2686adb5213b0d49c7aa79df6c24e/0_83_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d10d1580e197ab5086d8c72164c47575","title":"as a society we must get over the green loo","story":"The avocado bathroom suite is an interior design no-no these days, but it hardly proves that civilisation has reached its zenithFor some reason, Samsung has commissioned a study into what people think are the worst interior decoration fads of the last 50 years. I say “for some reason” because, at heart, I’m an optimist. I try to believe there’s a good reason or, failing that, some sort of reason for most of the things people do. But I must admit, in this instance, I’m struggling to think of one.Raising brand awareness perhaps? It certainly will do that, to a modest extent. Articles mentioning the study will probably mention Samsung, so it’s getting more mentions. But are they apposite mentions? It’s not as if Samsung makes interior designy things – or, if it does, there’s still a lot more brand awareness work to be done where I’m concerned. Can you get Samsung sofas, or curtains, or lamps, or wallpaper? Why didn’t Dulux or Laura Ashley or Ikea pay for this survey? I thought Samsung made mobile phones?To give Samsung’s marketing team credit, they have managed to corner me into mentioning that the firm makes mobile phones. So is that the strategy? To associate the brand with such weirdly unconnected areas of commerce that it forces people to contemplate the fact that it makes phones and puzzle over what links there might be between those phones and whatever interior design study, or real ale festival, or turbot-breeding initiative the logo is randomly stuck on?How tortuously cunning! It makes me feel like a dupe for having repeatedly written the word “Samsung” in the last few paragraphs and moves me to say that I once owned a Samsung mobile phone and, in all honesty, I thought it was crap. Much worse than a Nokia or an iPhone, in my view. And if I was ever interviewed by someone doing a survey into mobile phone use, perhaps sponsored by Robinsons Barley Water or Stanley Gibbons, that’s what I’d tell them.I suppose you can probably get Samsung TVs and surround-sound clobber, which are vaguely to do with interior design and may explain why “situation room levels of audio-visual equipment in what is supposed to be a lounge” isn’t one of the study’s top 10 most derided trends. Personally, I hate surround sound when I’m watching television. I want the sound to be made by what I’m looking at – and the pictures don’t surround you, so it’s just distracting when the noises do.Sometimes, it literally makes me turn away from the TV to see what’s happening behind me. Which obviously turns out to be nothing. But then, by the time I turn back to the screen, I’ve potentially missed a key bit of whatever’s going on. I mean, I hardly ever have missed anything, but you can’t be sure until you’ve rewound and checked. Otherwise, later on, when you inevitably find some element of the plot totally baffling, you become convinced that it would all be clear if you hadn’t missed that crucial instant of screen time. That’s my strong view. It’s not always the view of the person or people I’m watching TV with. So, all in all, surround sound is a\u0026nbspdisaster.But it’s not something the 2,000 respondents to the survey were bothered by. When asked to rank their least favourite of the last half century’s home decor ideas, from a list of suggestions drawn up by design writers, their collated responses produced the following top five: first, furry lavatory rugs and loo seat covers second, stuffed animals third, avocado bathrooms fourth, chintzy furniture and fifth equal, waterbeds, Artex and carpeted bathrooms.So what do we learn from this list? On the plus side, it shows a timely rejection of trends for absorbent surfaces in the rooms most prone to stray excreta. Anyone who’s ever lived in a shared house will have come to view any little pink rug clinging round the communal lavatory pedestal with the sort of awed respect for extreme toxicity usually reserved for a nerve\u0026nbspagent.But, on the minus, it’s a lamentable reflection of how susceptible people are to fashion, not just in what is popular, but also in what is unfashionable. It’s long established that fashion can make people think they adore the daft and hideous. But this list suggests it can also make them dutifully loathe the completely\u0026nbspinoffensive.I’m talking about avocado bathrooms. A decade ago, I co-wrote a TV sketch about how our culture has completely lost its sense of perspective about avocado bathrooms. And, as further proof of the complete impotence of satire, the situation has only worsened in the intervening years.It’s just green. An avocado bathroom is just green. All that’s happened is that a thing, the colour of which can be dictated in the manufacturing process – as it can with clothes, cars, crockery, carpets, toothbrushes and many many other items – has been made green. An extremely normal colour. It is one of the main colours for things to be. Many things are naturally green, but many others are deliberately rendered green, or partly green, in order to look nice.But people behave, and are being encouraged by designers to behave, as if having a loo, sink and bath that are coloured green, or indeed any colour other than white, is hideous and insane as if it shows the worst excesses of “What were we thinking?!” fashion craziness – kipper ties, mullets, puffball skirts and bound feet all rolled into one as if some final epiphany about the wrongness of baths being any colour apart from white has been reached.It’s not that green sinks aren’t currently fashionable: the implication is that it’s been decided they never will be again. It’s something society has permanently moved on from, like slavery. This reeks of the arrogance of the contemporary: we are the era that’s got it right, that finally understands.

Recent weeks have taken me to Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain. I learned much about these very different countries, but the most important takeaway was about my own. The largest conclusion I drew from recent conversations on the continent is that Europe is no longer terribly interested in these islands. How much attention are our closest neighbours paying to what is happening to the United Kingdom? Not much, in truth.The week ahead in Britain will see the energies of its parliament expended on the latest developments in a Brexit plot that is becoming hideously complex even for those of us paid to follow it. Exactly like the week just gone then. No different to many weeks previously. Breathless news bulletins bring the latest about the drama of tight parliamentary votes along with threatened cabinet resignations and actual ones lower down the political food chain. Reporters endeavour to explain to head-scratching viewers why the cabinet is angrily ided over “time-limiting the backstop”. Theresa May thinks it a good night’s work when she survives to prevaricate another day. Jeremy Corbyn achieves the unusual feat of splitting Labour MPs three ways over a key vote on what kind of Brexit we should be having. The Westminster air grows fetid with tales of last-minute bargains and stories of betrayal. The characters alternate between insulting each other in the most vitriolic language and torturing us with rival ways to define “a meaningful vote”.This is hard enough to make sense of if you are British. Hayley Hughes of Love Island has been much mocked for admitting she is baffled by Brexit. The ridicule was unreasonable. After all, the people who are supposed to be in charge of Brexit, the contestants on the Hate Island that is the Tory party, don’t appear to have a clue either. The negotiations with Brussels are stalled because the cabinet is still not agreed on which form of customs arrangement to propose for rejection by the EU.Even the natives are struggling to keep a grip on this surreal soap opera. How much less accessible is the grisly show to anyone tuning in from elsewhere? The comic English eccentrics who were introduced to amuse foreign audiences have ceased to raise a laugh. Boris Johnson just isn’t funny any more.The continental shrug was not always the case. In the immediate aftermath of the referendum – a long and painful two years ago – there was much fascination with what was happening here. From princes to paupers, just about everyone on the continent had an opinion about Britain’s narrow decision to self-amputate itself from the EU. Many were taken aback by a choice that ran counter to the stereotype of a nation of level-headed pragmatists who prized orderly stability above most things. Many were dismayed and puzzled and echoed the hope expressed by Donald Tusk that somehow the decision might be reversed. Some, particularly Germans, were wounded that Britain had chosen orce. Others, the ardent integrationists in Brussels, were happy to say good riddance to the EU’s most truculent member.Twenty-four months later, I’d say lack of interest is the primary response to Britain. For Ireland, unwillingly pressed on to the frontline by geography and economics, this is not the case, because a bungled Brexit will have nasty consequences for the republic. Elsewhere in Europe, the initial shock has numbed into indifference.This is less true as you move up the ladder of financial and political power. Business leaders, people in government and other decision-makers are still giving it some attention. They are conscious of the scale of the stakes. The most horrible consequences of a car-crash Brexit would be felt on these islands, but a “no deal” outcome would be painful for many EU countries as well. It is not just German business that has cause for concern about the negative consequences for trade and investment of an acrimonious British departure. Even so, even among business and political leaders, there is diminishing patience with what is seen as a second-order issue for Europe. Viewed from Berlin, Paris, Rome, the Hague or Madrid, the theatrics at Westminster are of marginal interest compared with the mounting strategic challenges facing the EU.There were always more important things for most Europeans to be anxious about than the islands on the north-western shore of the continent. They are concentrating their minds on those, rather than trying to fathom the unfathomable intents of this country and its flailing government. George Soros goes so far as to say that the challenges facing the EU amount to “an existential crisis”.Europe is confronted with a growing and increasingly grave crisis over immigration. Authoritarian governments in Hungary and Poland are defying founding principles of the EU. Vladimir Putin, who would achieve a major geopolitical triumph if the EU started to break up, will be on his best behaviour only for the duration of the World Cup. The best-case scenario about the new government in Italy is that it doesn’t last long enough to wreak too much havoc. Italy is too important to the EU to be allowed to fail but too large to be saved. A financial meltdown in Europe’s fourth largest economy would merit the adjective existential. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for long the most powerful fixed point in European affairs, is struggling to sustain her domestic coalition. France’s Emmanuel Macron has been better at generating a vision for reviving the EU than at winning support for his ideas among other key leaders.Then there is Donald Trump. The fear he induces in Europe makes Brexit look trivial and Britain’s decision to quit the EU even more misjudged. The poisoned G7 summit in Quebec has left relations between the US and its historic allies in the democratic world in a darker place than at any time in living memory. Even by his standards, it was a special achievement for the American president to viciously insult Canada en route to lavishing praise on North Korea’s totalitarian-in-chief. There is trepidation in European capitals about what will unfold when the American president is next thrown into proximity with other leaders at the Nato summit in July.It used to be the conceit of British prime ministers that they could be a transatlantic “bridge” between Europe and the US. This was often delusional, but occasionally bore some relation to the truth. No one in Europe now looks to Theresa May to be a go-between with Donald Trump. Any British prime minister would find it hard to navigate a relationship with a volatile occupant of the White House who is so cavalier about its traditional alliances. It is not Mrs May’s fault that her premiership has coincided with the Trump presidency. It was Britain’s decision to detach itself from its continental neighbours just at the time when America went rogue.The Trump-triggered escalation towards a global trade war emphasises how marginalised Britain has become and what a perilous place the world can be for a medium-size state without reliable allies. Trade wars are waged by elephants smaller animals get crushed underfoot. Rounds of destructively macho tit-for-tat tariff retaliation makes the climate even less clement for striking a decent deal with the EU. Trumpian belligerence exposes what a fantasy it was to believe that Britain only had to shake itself free from Europe to conjure up golden trade deals with the rest of the world.We could conduct a thought experiment and wonder what part Britain might be playing on this turbulent planet had the country made a different choice in the summer of 2016. Britain could be having an influential role in shaping what sort of Europe, what sort of world, emerges next. A British voice might have been a powerful one urging and helping Europe to defend shared values and interests against authoritarianism, nationalism and protectionism. The cost of leaving the EU will be counted not just in pounds and pence but also in influence forgone. The British political class is too consumed by Brexit to think about the world. The world has bigger things on its plate than Brexit.A fractured planet is in great flux. Many of the things we have taken for granted about the international order over many decades are in play. Where the pieces ultimately land will have profound consequences for these islands. And where is Britain? Britain is busy with a bunfight at the bottom of its own navel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717a42d168d1ca3f6a5f78374d50caa76c1c9784/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=734d83138523765495eb347666f91b3f","title":"we can teach our children about technology but ban phones in school","story":"When I heard that Eton now requires its year 7s to hand in their mobile phones at bedtime, my immediate thought was I quite like the idea of a check-in, zone-out service that would confiscate my smartphone as the Love Island credits start to roll and return it in time for the 8am news bulletin. But if Eton expects its 13-year-old boarders to hand in their phones overnight, where are they the rest of the time? And why are older boys allowed to keep their phones overnight?On schools and smartphones, I’m an enthusiastic proponent of the nanny state. After Emmanuel Macron made it a key pledge in his presidential campaign, the French government is banning mobile phones in schools altogether after September. In the UK, the decision is left to headteachers: some ban them, others take a more permissive approach.France has got it right. It is surely beneficial for all young people to have a few hours where they are disconnected and school, which should be a distraction-free zone, is the right place to enforce that. The educational benefits make it a no-brainer: an LSE study found that banning smartphone use in schools boosted results, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The researchers estimated it was equivalent to providing an extra five days of school for these young people, something that by my (admittedly back-of-an-envelope) calculation would cost more than £1bn a year for five- to 16-year-olds in England and Wales.This would undoubtedly be opposed by those edtech evangelists who argue that banning phones will limit rather than augment learning. But to say the evidence that technology in schools improves learning is shaky would be a polite way of putting it. Others will complain that it’s impractical to enforce: won’t schools need to install secure lockers? But a technological solution such as 4G signal-jammers would mean that parents could still reach children after school, but access to the internet during the day could be tightly regulated by teachers.There’s a reason some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are sending their children to screen-free schools. They’re all too aware that the currency in which social media companies trade is time spent on their platforms. Developers have responded to those commercial incentives in ingenious ways: the “like” buttons that deliver the dopamine hits that keep us coming back for more the unlimited scroll and autoplay functions that keep us hooked the constant stream of alerts and notifications that draw us back in the read receipts and status updates that fuel more interactions by making us feel it would be rude not to respond immediately.A new report by the 5Rights foundation looks at how these addictive features affect young people. It highlights that excessive social media use is linked with anxiety, self-doubt and low self-esteem, aggression, bullying and sleep deprivation. “Scrolling forever gives me a sick feeling in my stomach,” one young person told researchers. “All I want to do is disconnect from my phone for a long period of time… but there are always pressures preventing me,” said another.Nanny-statism in the form of school bans should absolutely form part of the response – this is stuff that kids deserve to be protected from – but we also need to develop children’s resilience to addictive technologies that fuel negative behaviour. That doesn’t mean simply teaching children about the dangers of social media in the classroom, which would be akin to letting loose a bunch of 17-year-olds on the roads with no more than a theory test under their belts. Instead, we should be providing safe spaces in which children can learn positive online behaviour.CyberSmarties in Ireland is one such initiative. Its founder, Diarmuid Hudner, likens it to bike stabilisers for a social media age. It’s a locked-down, safe social network exclusively for seven- to 12-year-olds that works in partnership with primary schools, with more than 80,000 users.It’s what a network might look like were it designed with the needs of children, rather than the commercial interests of Silicon Valley, in mind. Negative messages are flagged and children asked to reword them before they are sent. Clicking on an “I’m feeling sad” button prompts positive comments that the child’s friends have made about them to pop up. The network is monitored by a team of more than 50 trained moderators while it is operational, between 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. Moderators inform schools about any incidents of bullying so they can be proactively addressed by teachers.The hope is that teaching positive behaviour to a pre-smartphone age-group will better equip them to cope with the world of adult social networks. The jury is still out on the long-term impacts – the network has only been running three years – but it has all but eliminated cyberbullying within the site itself.While the government should be doing more to get social media companies to enforce age restrictions and to remove addictive features for the under-18s, it should also be piloting initiatives such as CyberSmarties. But the sad truth is that in a world where it has taken years of tireless campaigning to have sex and relationships education made compulsory in all English schools, despite the numbers of children now viewing porn online, we’re much more likely to see hand-wringing than real action.Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that we adults are not generally very good at modelling responsible tech behaviour for children: the average adult smartphone user touches their phone more than 2,600 times a day. I suspect it isn’t just schoolkids who’d benefit from a smartphone confiscation service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1d9174ca860658b1bcf7f63ba70d3e7a06fb67/0_182_4855_2914/master/4855.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cdd5321dc0c3a986e14f58275f0f897","title":"andrew scott interview sea wall sherlock hamlet king lear shakespeare","story":"Andrew Scott, 41, was born and raised in Dublin. Recently seen in the BBC adaptation of King Lear, he is best known for playing Moriarty in Sherlock, and for starring in Robert Icke’s production of Hamlet, which transferred from the Almeida to the West End last year. In 2008, Simon Stephens wrote Sea Wall – a monologue about grief – for Scott it is being revived as part of the Old Vic’s bicentenary celebrations.How is it performing Sea Wall alone on stage?This one I love. I did it at Edinburgh,\u0026nbspand you could actually see the audience. There isn’t any separation, and the house lights are usually half-up.The play gets to some big questions pretty quickly – such as, do you need God when terrible things happen?The idea of goodness, morality and kindness, and that you can possess those qualities without an organised faith… I think a lot of people of my generation feel that. People want to be kind and good, and have a sense of community, all that the church used to bring.You were brought up as a Catholic. Does it still hold anything for you?No, it doesn’t. I hid away from it before, but now I feel like I actively reject my upbringing. Not in an angry way – I don’t feel angry any more. A lot of family and friends do still believe, and you’ve got to exist with that. But over the past five years I’ve been really interested in the idea of spirituality and mindfulness – just being here. I do find it troubling, being on a train and looking round and everyone is on their phones. We can be addicted to not being here, to always being somewhere else. Having all this information is so new you realise, God, I actually can’t sit still. Just to be there and not to be looking for a little high all the time… That will define our age.How was playing Hamlet?It was extraordinary. I’m still absorbing it. After I finished, two weeks later I did King Lear: I had a Shakes-year, boom-boom. But it’s the stamina. Sometimes I thought I can’t do it – three hours and 50 minutes, twice on a Wednesday and Saturday. And it’s not light material you have to go to a dark place.What was your way into that part?I really wanted it to be engaging for people who’d never seen it before. Rob Icke and I wanted it to be a play that would ignite our 14-year-old selves. And the big thing was to try to speak the language in as conversational a way as possible. To attack the play for what it is rather than what you think it is – because it’s so famous. I do think it is the greatest play ever\u0026nbspwritten.It might be the greatest play ever written – but do we do it too often?There are a lot on! You have to have a really sound idea – you can’t just barge in. There has to be a real reason behind it. I felt very proud of our production: 28,000 young people came to it. Something like half of the audience in the West End\u0026nbsphad never been to the theatre\u0026nbspbefore. And that’s an achievement.A first bad experience of Shakespeare can kill it for you, whereas a good one can set you up for life…I always think of it like rap music – there’s the rhythm of the thing, and even if you don’t get every word, it’s electrifying. I just hate the idea of Shakespeare being put in a glass box, like something that’s dead.You played Hamlet hot on the heels of Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch. Was there rivalry?There was no rivalry. It has to be your own thing, you have to bring who you are to it – so it shouldn’t be similar.Hamlet may be the best part – but what’s the worst part you’ve ever\u0026nbsphad?I played a Christmas bauble at the Royal Court. It was at this international festival, which are cool things – but I couldn’t do anything playing a Christmas bauble. I didn’t\u0026nbspeven get a costume, I just had to mime!Did you like Shakespeare at school? I loved Shakespeare as a kid. We used to have these drama competitions in Dublin, in deserted atmosphere-less school halls, with nervous mums and some priest slowly pulling a curtain open: “Competitor number three, an extract from Romeo and Juliet.” I got\u0026nbspto play, when I was 14, Richard III, Shylock, King John…How big an impact did Sherlock have on your career?Well, I’d worked a lot before it, but it definitely opened doors for all of us. I’m grateful to have been in it.You almost studied art. Is it still an interest?Yes, it’s still a big passion of mine. I’ve been getting into linoprinting recently. It feels like magic to me.Which artists’ work do you enjoy?I live near Tate Modern and sometimes, when it’s late opening, I go in when I’ve had a hard day, and just walk around. As much for the particular quiet as the art. David\u0026nbspHockney is my all-time favourite artist.Did you go home to Ireland for the abortion referendum recently?Unfortunately I couldn’t, because I was working. And I was really scared. But oh my God, what a day. Another great day – because we had the marriage referendum a couple of years ago which was just so thrilling. It was a great day not just for women, but for humanity.

On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road.

You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers. Enjoy and don’t worry if you miss your train home as Sheffield has more than enough to offer for further adventures. Alternatively, you could just do what I did and move here!Stay in the heart of the action, and let Sheffield’s creative spirit inspire you, by checking out homes on Airbnb"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ebccc3eb3fe63b9497db436ae7f456d9745e73/0_446_5337_3203/master/5337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ffecd280d7e1941fb08af610ccc76bf","title":"sea and be seen the insiders guide to margate","story":"Jimi Famurewa meets Margate’s most in-the-know locals and sizes up Kent’s Copenhagen-like capital of cool, where you can go to a major art gallery, swim in a scenic tidal pool, dine on Nordic cuisine and shop for designer homeware – without the flightIn lieu of a permanent move, more and more weekend visitors are taking advantage of Margate’s recent influx of acclaimed new restaurants, chic cafes, superior homeware stores, on-trend boutiques and more. In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

He recalls his early morning walks through its lanes, past the porches of houses on his round. At virtually every home, he saw the same picture: windows plastered with tiger moths that had been attracted by lights the previous night and were still clinging to the glass. “It was quite a sight,” says Leather, who is now a professor of entomology at Harper Adams University in Shropshire.But it is not a vision that he has experienced in recent years. Those tiger moths have almost disappeared. “You hardly see any, although there used to be thousands in summer and that was just a couple of villages.”It is an intriguing story and it is likely to be repeated over the next few weeks. The start of summer is the time of year when the nation’s insects should make their presence known by coating countryside windows with their fluttering presence, and splattering themselves on car windscreens. But they are spectacularly failing to do so. Instead they are making themselves newsworthy through their absence. Britain’s insects, it seems, are disappearing.This point was underlined last week when tweets from the naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham went viral after he commented on the absence of insects during a weekend at his home in the New Forest. Packham said he had not seen a single butterfly in his garden, and added that he sleeps with his windows open but rarely finds craneflies or moths in his room in the morning. By contrast, they were commonplace when he was a boy. “Our generation is presiding over an ecological apocalypse and we’ve somehow or other normalised it,” he later said.Certainly, the statistics are grim. Native ladybird populations are crashing three quarters of butterfly species – such as the painted lady and the Glanville fritillary – have dropped significantly in numbers while bees, of which there are more than 250 species in the UK, are also suffering major plunges in populations, with great yellow bumblebees, solitary potter flower bees and other species declining steeply in recent years. Other threatened insects include the New Forest cicada, the tansy beetle and the oil beetle.An insect Armageddon is under way, say many entomologists, the result of a multiple whammy of environmental impacts: pollution, habitat changes, overuse of pesticides, and global warming. And it is a decline that could have crucial consequences. Our creepy crawlies may have unsettling looks but they lie at the foot of a wildlife food chain that makes them vitally important to the makeup and nature of the countryside. They are “the little things that run the world” according to the distinguished Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson, who once observed: “If all humankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.”Further confirmation of the link between insect and bird numbers was provided last week with the publication of a study by Aberdeen University researchers which showed that the plunge in numbers of cuckoos in some areas of England was closely linked to declines in tiger moth caterpillars on which cuckoos feed.“There is now a lot of correlational evidence to show that when certain insects do badly, very often the birds that feed on them get into trouble as well,” said David Gibbon, of the RSPB.However, insects also play invaluable roles in other parts of the environment – for example as pollinators of our orchards and fruit fields. And again, scientists are worried. “People think that it is just bees that pollinate orchards, but there are huge numbers of flies that also pollinate – and they are all also threatened,” said Leather.In addition, flies, beetles and wasps are predators and decomposers who control pests and who generally clean up the countryside. “Just think of the work of the dung beetle,” added Leather. “If they go, the land would be covered with the excrement of cows, sheep and other animals.But perhaps the most alarming indication of the ecological apocalypse we face was provided a few months ago by researchers who published a startling paper in the journal Plos One. Their work was based on the efforts of dozens of amateur entomologists in Germany who began employing strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. They used special tents called malaise traps to capture thousands of samples of insects in flight over dozens of different nature reserves.Such figures give strong numerical support to the veracity of anecdotes about splattered car windscreens and moth-plastered patio windows becoming a thing of the past. Equally stark is the fact that although meteorological patterns fluctuated to some degree during the years of the study, it was clear that weather was not the cause of the declines.But perhaps the most alarming aspect of the research was the realisation that these grim drops in insect numbers were occurring in nature reserves – in other words, in areas where the landscape was highly protected and should be the most friendly of habitats for insects. Conditions elsewhere were likely to be a lot worse, the scientists warned.The fact that insect biomass has been declining at a steady rate for almost three decades strongly suggests some profound influences must be at work. Most entomologists believe habitat change lies at the heart of the problem. “There have been massive alterations to the way we use the land and it is hard not to believe these are closely involved in what we are seeing,” said Leather.As he points out, intensively farmed wheat and cornfields support virtually no insect life, and this means that as intensive agriculture spreads there are fewer and fewer islands of natural habitat left to support them.And then there is the issue of urban spread. Housing schemes continue to encroach on our woods and heaths so that streets and buildings generate light pollution that leads nocturnal insects astray and interrupts their mating. “That is the reason we see most changes to insect life in south-east England, for that is where we see the greatest spread of cities and towns,” said Leather.In addition to habitat changes, there are the dangers posed by pesticides, in particular neonicotinoid pesticides, which have already been blamed for recent crashes in bee populations. These chemicals are water soluble and so leach out of fields after they are applied to crops.According to research quoted in the journal Science last year, these pesticides have since been found in high concentrations in nectar and pollen in wildflowers near treated fields. Though still not at levels sufficiently high to kill insects directly, they do affect their abilities to navigate and communicate.In the face of this mixture of ecological woes, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in Britain are faring so badly. Whether or not they face an ecological apocalypse is a different matter, for not every expert shares a sense of doom. Professor Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, for example, sees cause for hope. She told the Observer that there were too many success stories – tales of insects that were recovering in numbers and thriving – to feel a sense of despair. “Obviously, many species are suffering, but I am an optimist and I just don’t think it is right to call this an apocalypse,” she said.This view was supported by David Gibbons of the RSPB who agreed that not every investigation about insect numbers revealed a tale of irrevocable decline – though he added that he still believed the overall picture was worrying. “It is hard not to see a link between some of the bird number declines and drops in insect populations we are experiencing. There are very close correlations in many cases. But proving there is a causative link – in establishing the one effect is leading to the other – is much more difficult.”The crucial point is that researchers were able to show that these twin declines were connnected by manipulating herbicide levels in places where chicks were being reared. When herbicide levels went up, insect levels went down and so did bird numbers. “That manipulation provided the causative link,” said Gibbons. “It was possible to change insect numbers and so see the impact. However, such research is difficult to carry out and is very rare.”And of course, threats to our birdlife are only one aspect of the dangers posed by losses of insects in the UK. As entomologists point out, they also keep our soil fertile, degrade waste, pollinate our orchards and control pests such as the aphid.“We cannot afford to lose them and that’s what makes this issue so urgent and so important,” Leather concluded. “That’s worth keeping in mind as the summer evenings begin – and we see hardly any insects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18677c7c5a7d9be328308547f665bfc37f34cfa6/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87cfa7de17a66a6b60c363487d109884 660w","title":"awkwafina oceans 8 youtube crazy funny nora lum","story":"When she’s starring alongside Sandra Bullock in Ocean’s 8 or rapping about her vagina on YouTube, she’s Awkwafina. But at home she’ll always be Nora Lum from QueensWhen she’s starring alongside Sandra Bullock in Ocean’s 8 or rapping about her vagina on YouTube, she’s Awkwafina. But at home she’ll always be Nora Lum from QueensThe front desk clerk at the Beverly Hills Hotel is polite but puzzled. “Nora Lum? No, we have no one staying here of that name.” How about Awkwafina, I ask, spelling it out for him. He looks at me as though he thinks I might be messing with him. “Sorry, madam,” – is that a note of relief in his voice? – “no one of that name either.” I reach for my phone, but then I have an idea. Sandra Bullock? Suddenly I have the attention of all three front desk clerks. “This way, madam.”Lum’s route to the top has been unconventional. In 2012, on her 24th birthday, she uploaded a rap video to YouTube entitled My Vag – sample lyric: “My vag speak five different languages  And told yo vag, ‘Bitch, make me a sandwich.’” Two things happened immediately, neither surprising. She was sacked from her job as a publicity assistant at a publishing company. And her father went ballistic. “He was screaming at me on the phone. He thought I was having a quarter-life crisis. And then we didn’t talk for a while…”What no one expected, least of all Lum, was that the video would become a viral hit and launch her on a career as a rapper and comedian. “I still can’t believe it worked: that’s crazy to me.” Absurdly brilliant, the song almost defies description. Suffice to say that “vag” or “vagina” is repeated 53 times and the video features Lum – wearing a “horrifying pair of chemistry goggles” – delivering random paraphernalia from a (thankfully unseen) vagina: a violin, a cabbage, a live cat, a toaster.Adopted by some as a sort of feminist anthem – a belated response to Mickey Avalon’s 2006 My Dick – the video has received more than 2.5m hits. Even Bullock is a fan. “At some point Sandy discovered My Vag and loved it,” says Lum. “She shares it, which is really cool…”Views will no doubt increase dramatically this year as Lum hits the mainstream, appearing in both Ocean’s 8 and, later this summer, in Crazy Rich Asians. “It’s an amazing time to be in Hollywood,” enthuses Lum. “The landscape is changing. Here I am with an all-female cast and an all-Asian cast. I’m fairly new to this industry and I have not experienced some of the struggles I’ve heard about. Time’s up and it’s about time. No more bullshit characters for women, especially Asian American women. Don’t piss off whole communities of people.”We meet first towards the end of her photoshoot. Although there are already at least 10 people in the room, Lum’s “wrangler” – as she calls her – is hesitant about letting me in, concerned I might write something revealing about the shoot. Fair enough: she’s just protecting her client. What she may not have grasped is that it is a little late to start protecting Lum. She has rapped about her vagina, joked about her apartment’s “semen-stained walls” and made quips about masturbation. Lum intervenes on my behalf. “Let her stay. What the fuck is she going to do? Write about my Spanx? Like I care…”Funny that she should beat me to that question. It turns out that even Awkwafina finds it hard to explain Awkwafina. “There is a duality between Awkwafina and Nora. Awkwafina is someone who never grew up, who never had to bear the brunt of all the insecurities and overthinking that come with adulthood. Awkwafina is the girl I was in high school – who did not give a shit. Nora is neurotic and an overthinker and could never perform in front of an audience of hecklers.”So if the phone rang early in the morning and she answered half-asleep, who would she be, Awkwafina or Nora? “Nora. I’m Nora most of the time. But when I’m in a good mood I’m Awkwafina. When I’m in a bad, sad, lonely mood, it’s Nora all the way. When I come home at night from being Awkwafina, that’s Nora. I compare it to The Mask…” She means the Jim Carrey movie about a timid bank clerk who discovers a magical character-changing mask. “Thank God for the mask.”Born Nora Lum in 1988, to a Chinese American father and South Korean immigrant mother, she grew up in Flushing, Queens. Her early years were marked by tragedy. Her mother was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension shortly after Lum’s birth. “It was a very slow illness and she lived for four more years. I remember her, but I remember mostly when she passed… Obviously it was a very tragic situation, but I felt odd and uncomfortable when adults cried to me. One of the first emotions I ever felt was embarrassment. So I started trying to make them laugh.”Her grandmother stepped in to help her father. “My grandmother was everything to me, she taught me that Asian women are strong, they’re not meek orchard-dwelling figures. She always knew I had something, not even star power but spunk – she got me singing lessons and we didn’t tell my dad, because he’d be like: ‘Why would you waste money on that, that’s just stupid.’”At school, she was the comedian. “I was always the crazy one, the funny one. I’d do anything for a laugh, like dunking an ice cream in my eye. Everybody would be: ‘Oh my God, I can’t believe she did that!’ These were not intellectual jokes.” She attended a performing arts high school, where she played the trumpet. At 15, she came up with the stage name Awkwafina. “I just thought it was a funny name. And it was fitting that it had ‘awkward’ in it, because I am awkward.” After majoring in journalism and women’s studies, she went to China to study Mandarin, then worked at a video rental store, an air-conditioning company and finally a publishing company.Following My Vag, she released a rap album Yellow Ranger, then joined her idol Margaret Cho on Green Tea, a song which lampoons Asian stereotypes. Later she morphed into acting – appearing in comedy movies like Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising – and pioneered her own gloriously deranged web chat show Tawk, which she hosted from corner stores and laundromats, complete with an octogenarian, boombox-bopping sidekick – as well as a segment from her 84-year-old grandmother Grammafina, who delivers pearls of wisdom from a leather armchair in a darkened room, such as, “You want to throw a good party, you serve some hors d’oeuvres.”“My grandmother’s such a ham,” Lum says. “She’s always like: ‘I’m so bad at acting.’ And then she murders it…”In Ocean’s 8, Lum plays Constance, a pickpocket whose adroitness attracts felon Debbie Ocean, played by Bullock, who is planning a heist at New York City’s annual Met Ball. Before meeting the cast, Lum was terrified. “I had waking nightmares I would say something weird. But they welcomed me, they were so warm. There was so much laughter on set. I consider them my heroes – but now they are also my friends.” They keep in regular touch with a group text. “It’s always a joy to wake up to a text from one of them. We have a lot of gifs, a lot of laugh-out-loud jokes.”Lum – who still raps and has just released a five-song EP In Fina We Trust – does not think she will ever feel like a movie star. “I’m physically insecure. It came with puberty, not feeling pretty. But when I say that to my grandmother, she’s like: ‘Bitch, you’re fine…’ But I don’t think I’ll ever carry myself like a star. Look at me now, bent over slurping up soup.” She says she finds it hard to relax into her success. “Even when I’m lying in bed at night I’m thinking, ‘What more can I do?’ I keep feeling I’ll pay for it all some way.”Yet she thoroughly enjoyed one moment while filming Ocean’s 8 in New York. “We were shooting this glamorous scene and I looked up and saw the office I got fired from. I thought: ‘Oh my God, everything has come full circle.’ I left that job in pursuit of Awkwafina. And here I was shooting a scene with Rihanna. Getting fired from that job really hurt my feelings. Now I could just look up and say, ‘Fuck y’all.’”Lum still talks to her grandmother almost every day. “She’s my therapist.” And even her father has come round. “Now he won’t leave me alone,” she says affectionately, “although I still, to this day, get random emails about government jobs from all the job lists he signed me up for. He just wanted good for me.” On a personal level, she says she feels very settled with her long-term boyfriend: “I’m extremely happy. I’m in love.” And yet: “I’m not sure I will ever be the kind of woman who can retire into a family.”I ask her if Lum and Awkwafina will ever go their separate ways. “At some point they might have to. I don’t think an 85-year-old Awkwafina will be the most normal look… By then people will be laughing at me, not with me – I will be coughing loudly and yelling at birds. But then I look at my grandmother and she’s still pretty fricking cool.”Our time is up. The hotel wants the room back and someone is ringing the phone and knocking on the door simultaneously. “They’re aggressive as fuck,” she grumbles, as she grabs her things. “Oooh,” she exclaims, spying a side table crammed with bottles of designer water. “I’m just going to steal these.” She grabs an armful, chuckling as we leave the room: “I guess I’ll always be a hustler.”Ocean’s 8 is in cinemas from tomorrow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e011723c69d85c99a662a61d1563bb59c5ae323/0_387_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d9e03a49a94ab93cccf21aba1cd01a","title":"hereditary review mark kermode horror toni collette gabriel byrne","story":"Breathless comparisons to The Exorcist, The Shining and Psycho do this fitfully frightening yet ultimately frustrating chiller few favours. Talented writer-director Ari Aster’s flawed feature debut has more in common with such recently challenging titles as The Witch or It Comes at Night (both also distributed in the US by indie-kings A24), although this tale of a cursed family possesses neither the sustained bone-chilling intensity of the former nor the sociopolitical dread of the latter. Veering erratically between promising setups and disappointing payoffs, it shifts from something reminiscent of the scary satire of Ira Levin toward the altogether dopier domain of Dennis Wheatley. Ironically, it’s the very things that Hereditary gets just right that make its clunkier missteps seem so wrong.We start in fine form, with an Ordinary People-style opening that seems to ask: “What’s wrong with this picture?” Following the death of her mother, Ellen, a secretive woman with “private rituals, private friends”, artist Annie (Toni Collette) feels her world falling apart. Unable to mourn (“Should I be sadder?”) and prone to sleepwalking, she pours her troubles into her work, building small-world miniatures that resemble doll’s houses designed by Diane Arbus. It’s into one of these models that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski’s camera creeps in the opening sequence, segueing seamlessly into the internecine action, suggesting that everything we see is happening in a weirdly artificial world, constructed by Annie’s inherited anxieties.That sense of unease grows as Annie’s family scuttle around the shadows of their haunted home. Her disconnected daughter, Charlie (arresting Broadway star Milly Shapiro), cries out for her grandma, and makes strange clucking sounds while fashioning morbid totems. Husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has the air of a condemned man as he fields calls from the cemetery about Ellen’s last resting place. As for teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), he just wants to get stoned with his buddies, clearly unable to deal with the unspoken secrets lurking in his family’s past (“Nobody admits anything they’ve done!”). And then something happens that turns grief into traumatised terror, reopening old wounds and inviting in new horrors.To reveal specifics would risk spoiling one of the most genuinely alarming sequences I’ve seen in recent years – a breathtaking jolt that made me gasp and recoil, intensified by the protracted shell-shocked silence that follows. It’s a bravura cinematic coup, setting the scene for a spine-tingling meditation on grief and guilt, our senses sharpened by the promise of further scares. Those familiar with Aster’s short films The Strange Thing About the Johnsons and Munchausen will be primed for a poisonous dissection of twisted family rituals.Elsewhere, a 90-degree camera-tilt mirrors a memorable moment from Babak Anvari’s Under the Shadow, an astute point of reference from another tale of a besieged mother. All the more disappointing, then, that what follows gradually downshifts into generic cliche, abandoning well-mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition.Plaudits are due to the ensemble cast for maintaining an air of realistic distress and derangement, even as the plot parts company with credibility. Collette is terrific as the tortuously conflicted mother whose performance recalls the intensity of Essie Davis in The Babadook, a superior film to which this clearly owes a debt. Scenes between Collette and Shapiro have rich emotional resonance, while Wolff brings a sense of bewildered anger to the family table, matching Gabriel Byrne’s hangdog exasperation. Meanwhile, Ann Dowd, who recently earned an Emmy for TV’s The Handmaid’s Tale, has a tougher time as Joan, a broad-stroke character who appears to have wandered straight off the set of Rosemary’s Baby.A groaning atonal soundtrack, full of rising polyphonic crescendos and harsh cuts, provides a heartbeat of horror that pulses through a film that wears its influences on its sleeve. Yet those lured in by the quivering quotes on the posters run the risk of being underwhelmed by Hereditary, which, for all its stylistic strengths and subversive subtexts, scares only sporadically. Oh, and for the record, it’s William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist III (rather than William Friedkin’s epochal original) that is most clearly evoked in a couple of creepy-crawly scenes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b7cb5ea35a2e234605964198afe0ba13112f74/0_98_4782_2870/master/4782.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abe565aac3b4b77dd37f223bd8cb7bf5","title":"gareth southgate england team selection tunisia world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate has moved to ease any anxiety within his England squad by making the unusual decision to reveal his selection to the players well in advance of Monday’s opening group game against Tunisia.England travel to Volgograd with a fully fit squad available to the manager, with Marcus Rashford having been integrated back into training in Repino, and with their lineup for the Group G opener decided. That is understood to mean World Cup debuts for nine players with starts for Ashley Young at left wing-back and Harry Maguire in central defence, while Jordan Henderson will be the side’s midfield anchor instead of Eric Dier.The choice to disclose the selection to his players is surprising for Southgate, who has tended to name his side on the day of the game, but is designed to allow those involved to focus fully on their task at the Volgograd Arena. Rob Green revealed last week that he had been given only two hours’ notice he was to play in England’s opening game at the 2010 World Cup and duly made a bad mistake in the 1-1 draw with the United States. It would be almost two years before the goalkeeper played for England again.“The players know the team for the first game already,” said Southgate. “We have been working on a system of play we think suits the players we have available and the style of play we want to implement as well.“From our fans’ point of view, they’re enjoying seeing young players come into the squad. Everyone at home wants England to win but they want to see them play well and enjoy their football and that’s what I want as a coach. So if we can marry those things and the environment is right, then we think results become part of that process.“Whenever you represent England, or any other country, there’s expectation, there’s hope, you carry the dreams of a nation, and it’s impossible to say to any player you can go out and play without any feeling of pressure or any feeling or fear.“But what you have to do is make sure that doesn’t control you and that you go for it in your performances. You don’t feel: ‘Oh, I was inhibited in the way I played’ or worry about making mistakes because mistakes will happen for certain. So no, I think pressure is what you perceive and very often that comes from listening to too much external noise. Actually we have to focus on the things we can control and they’re things within our camp and within our team.”Southgate heaped praise on Harry Kane but has urged the Tottenham striker’s creative teammates to ease the goalscoring burden on his captain.“He’s only played something like seven games in our 18 matches and he’s scored eight goals, so he’s pretty important,” added Southgate.While Southgate was talking, Danny Rose explained why the squad is not about to question the manager. The left-back believes the moment he dropped Wayne Rooney for a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia in 2016, he put down an important marker.“I definitely didn’t expect the manager to drop him against Slovenia and as soon as we all saw that we knew the gaffer was not somebody to be messed around with,” said Rose.Monday’s Group G fixture will be officiated by the experienced Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, who has been on the Fifa list for a decade and is at his second World Cup finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3a2d6dd6ad59956f075f999da485de5284dbc3/4_110_1762_1057/master/1762.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f17cb41d1d58a0ce297a1c2f507ed161","title":"john barnes england racism walking off world cup russia","story":"The former England forward talks about the racism he experienced and why current players should make up their own minds about walking off if abused at the World Cup in RussiaJohn Barnes tells a story about a season-ticket holder at Liverpool who would become a friend and whose seat was in front of two men at Anfield having a conversation about Barnes’s proposed transfer from Watford in 1987. “Not sure about black players,” one said to the other. “Don’t know about their character.”A few months later, on his home debut against Oxford United, Barnes scored a superb goal following a free-kick. The same bloke turned to the other, within earshot of the man who would later relay the tale to Barnes, and said: “You know, he’s not as black as I thought he was.”Barnes has heard and seen it all. From the racist chanting at Chelsea on his debut for Watford as a 17-year‑old, to being called a “sambo” by National Front sympathisers who somehow made it on to a plane carrying England on a tour of South America in 1984. This was just a few days after he scored that amazing, mazy goal in the Maracanã in a 2-0 win over\u0026nbspBrazil.Thus is the man who won 79 England caps the perfect person to address the issue of racism and racial abuse that has threatened to accompany Russia’s World Cup. His take on it, and the recent hot topic of whether players should walk off the field if subjected to abuse, is not what might be expected, however.“Yes, I went through overt racism as a footballer in the 80s and early 90s but that was, or is, nothing compared to what the average black person in the inner cities of England goes through every day,” he says.“I’m John Barnes, high-profile footballer who had bananas thrown at him during a match, and ignorant people shouting racist abuse at him for 90 minutes – before getting into my big car and driving to my nice house – but is that as bad as the huge majority of black people who live in squalor and have no hope for themselves or their children being given an equal opportunity socially, economically or educationally?”Barnes believes you cannot separate football from society. He advances a potent, trenchant argument. “Since I’ve been involved in professional football, it’s as if the rest of society is OK but football has a long way to go. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I’ve been saying for decades, as long as racism exists in society, it will exist in all facets of society. Until we eradicate it from society, football will be like any other industry.“Before we are footballers or fans, we are ordinary members of society. We are doctors, lawyers, milkmen, postmen, unemployed people, students … So why are they called racist football fans? Are they just racist for the 90 minutes of a match, when the other six days a week they’re not?”Born in Jamaica, Barnes came to England when his army colonel father, Kenneth, who had played football himself for his country, became military attaché to London. Later, in 1984, as his Watford side prepared to face Everton in the FA Cup final, Barnes was waiting for his dad in the Lillywhites sports shop at Piccadilly Circus when he was asked to leave by staff concerned he might be a shoplifter. His cultural heritage and such experience gives him huge historical\u0026nbspinsight.“Racial discrimination is understandable due to the narrative that has been spun to us for the last 500 years about the worthiness, morality, and intellect of a certain group of people in relation to other groups, particularly black people,” Barnes says. “So the fact that we are now being told we are all equal … Well, it will take a much more substantial effort than ‘We are all the same’ to change a widely held belief through mistaken colonial history that was taught which wrongly convinced us that white people are superior.“We hear a lot of ‘black players should’, or ‘black people should.’ Are we all sheep who should act a particular way because we are all the same and aren’t inidual people?“Would we ever say ‘white people should’? No, because we inidualise white culture. French, Spanish, German, English are accepted as being so different from each other. But we are just ‘black people’. African society and culture varies much more than European society but it’s just considered ‘Africa’ as if they are all the same.”Early this month, Barnes called in to a TalkSport debate about whether England’s black players should walk off the field should they be racially abused in Russia. He felt compelled to discuss the issue – heatedly – with the black journalist Darren Lewis, who believed they should.“I know and respect Darren and get on well with him,” Barnes says, “but I believe that rather than look at Russia, let’s look closer to home before we start to throw stones. I used as an example his profession of journalism. I said how underrepresented ethnic and black people are in the mainstream media.“He started to name four or five black journalists who work in that industry. Chris Hughton could do the same when asked about the lack of black managers by mentioning the four or five there are. We all know it’s a problem. But rather than talk about racism in Russia, or football, I prefer to talk about inequalities in society which are much wider and accepted.”So should Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli et al walk off if abused? “Well, it depends on your interpretation of racist abuse,” Barnes says. “If one idiot in the crowd shouts at you, and you are the only one who hears, you are being told that you are fully entitled to walk off.\u0026nbspReally? Just one? More? Many more? What form? Booing every time a black player gets the ball isn’t illegal, even though you know why the fans boo. It’s too ambiguous.“We are told our young black players have strong views. As if older black players didn’t have strong views. And that walking off shows their strength. I wouldn’t honour black players of the past who went through much worse than I did by walking off the field to show my ‘strength’ because some ignorant fool shouts racist abuse. I preferred to carry on and do what I did best.“That said, I would never advise a young black player to walk off or not walk off the field regardless of how I dealt with it, because we are all different. Again, the ‘black players should’ line … I find it insulting to suggest we are all the same.“Racial bias is not just about verbal or physical abuse. It’s also about the perception society has of the ordinary black person when they apply for jobs or credit, or who we believe to be more worthy, intelligent or moral. Which form of discrimination is worse?”It is those without a voice he feels the need to speak up for, or help to find their own. “It has always embarrassed me when people from the black community feel sorry for or support me and other black high‑profile members of society, such as actors and singers,” he says.“I feel like shaking them and saying: ‘What about demanding equality and dignity for yourselves and your children?’ Have they become so devoid of hope for that, that they vicariously feel pride through a ‘superstar’ black person making it? Until the black person in the street is seen as equal, black people will never be equal.”There remains, as he continues with his trademark machine-gun delivery, a fierce passion for football and life. “A black friend said that while he supported Liverpool, he would never go to watch until they signed an average black player. He meant that while Liverpool have signed countless average white players and no one batted an eyelid, a black player had to be better than the average white player or the narrative would be that black players aren’t good enough.“If we really want to be considered equal, the testament to that wouldn’t be great black people being successful, it would be average black people being as successful as average white people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b14ed8763d2ad7a7e0a58fba43ed9cd9cc54f0e/0_379_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7117e43e6b16d2a93a1b5676f1cea6a","title":"darren anderton england tunisia 1998 world cup","story":"Midfielder was in England’s team that beat Tunisia at the World Cup 20 years ago and says patience and fearlessness are keyThere was a lot of trouble before we played Tunisia in Marseille. The two or three days leading up to the game were unpleasant. A lot of the squad had family over there, so it wasn’t easy.We were aware of what was going on. We had families flying over in the morning or on the night before and you just never know, do you? My mum and step-dad were out there. They were having a holiday in France and were travelling down for the game. I spoke to them and it was fine but it’s something you think about. You just had to assume that people you cared about were going to stay well clear of the trouble.We were buzzing for the game, though, and could not wait for the tournament to start. It was a really hot afternoon and we were expected to win, like the guys are now. But none of us were taking anything for granted after the way we started Euro 96 against Switzerland. Tunisia were defensive and I’m sure it will be the same on Monday. You have to be patient. First games can be tedious and are so important not to lose, which makes them even more nervy.The heat was an advantage for Tunisia. The pitch was dry and sticky and we were playing against a team who wanted to frustrate us and try to nick a draw or a goal on the break. It was far from ideal. We would rather have played at night with a bit of dew on the pitch because then the ball zips around. But we believed we could control the pace of the game and have most of the possession.The key was to get the first goal and force them to come out a bit more. It worked out perfectly in the end. Alan Shearer made it 1-0 in the first half and we never looked back. Paul Scholes scored a great second goal to finish it off and it was a comfortable win in the end.Our experience helped. We had players like David Seaman, Tony Adams, Paul Ince and David Batty, although we also had a few youngsters coming through – Michael Owen, Becks, Scholesy and Sol Campbell. Rio Ferdinand was in the squad as well. We had a good blend. People always talk about Euro 96 but I thought we had a special squad in 1998.This team is much more inexperienced and this is the first World Cup game for a lot of these players, which makes a difference. People question whether the players care as much about international football these days but playing in the World Cup is the dream. You’re very aware that you’re lucky to be there and also that you might not get another crack at it. A lot of nerves come with that. You want to perform well for yourself and make sure the team starts well.Gareth Southgate has a lot of quality at his disposal, though, and I think he’s doing a good job. I played with him for England and could see him being a coach one day. It was a surprise when he became England manager but he was an appointment from within: English, a good guy and a very clever man. He played the game in an intelligent way, read the game brilliantly and was pretty underrated.He’s found a system that suits international football. Glenn Hoddle used a back three in 1998 and it helped us dominate possession. We had more players in midfield and didn’t get overrun. I played at right wing-back and although it was tough not to have the security of a right-back behind me, we were told to play in a positive way. We wanted people on the ball in good areas and I think Gareth has a similar mentality.If I have one piece of advice for the boys, it’s to play without fear. We had so much confidence back then. We were on a high after Euro 96. Glenn was very good tactically. We always seemed to have the ball. We had players who could cause trouble for the opposition. It makes a huge difference when your creative players are able to shine. If the likes of Dele Alli do well, England can have a good tournament. I want to see them play with freedom and enjoy themselves. That’s what it’s all about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b1c278b7cecf8c621bd3712ff12337f26f204a9/0_79_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bc822fd2280a502a04d18e13fe35613","title":"costa rica v serbia world cup 2018 live","story":"To set your minds at rest.Also that evening: the sole of my Air Jordan 3 (black cement, original) came away from the shoe. A woman on the next table only gave me super glue from her handbag! I’m pretty sure this kindness and serendipity is what saved the beautiful game. Feel free to send in the worst things you’ve overheard at football, and your favourite coincidences too. However it is with deep regret that I relate the following anecdote: In 2011, I was in the Sloaney Pony before Chelsea played Manchester United in the Champions League. A Chelsea fan on the next table was informing his son how easily United’s attack would be nullified. “With John and Branno,” he said, “no problemo!”Somehow, though, football pulled through, was not cancelled forever, and here we are today. Mazal tov! With today’s cap, his 104th, Branislav Ivanovic becomes Serbia’s most capped player ahead of Dejan Stankovic. And then, of course, there’s old Mitro – precisely the kind of cat you want to see scoring at a World Cup. We deserve his celebration.Serbia, meanwhile, opt for two midfield anchors – I’m not certain they’ll need that – but it’s in front of them where the fun is to be had. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is a brilliant talent, while flanking him he has the guile of Adem Ljajic and Dusan Tadic. I wonder if, at some point, Tadic might go over to the left to help his team get around the back, but in the meantime, look for him to wander infield to combine with his two pals. So yeah, about that proud Costa Rican tradition. I hoped, but by the looks of things, they’ll play as they should play and they played against England: with numbers at the back, and looking to counter if and when they can. Everyone deserves to be spoilt once in a quadrennial period, and as such, I have no compunction whatsoever in sayingAnd we’ve decent reason to hope that today’s first attempt might just be the thing. Costa Rica have a proud tradition of attacking football, they need the points, and they might not want to invite Serbia onto them. That’s because Serbia scored 20 times in 10 qualifiers and, particularly in midfield, have players with skill, imagination and wit.It’s fair to assume that Brazil will win this group, but both these outfits – and Switzerland too – will fancy their chances of chapping the second last-16 spot. So, in theory, this should be acceptable. In theory.

Until we meet again...And for those who need to know more about Serbia...A good time for this...Not content with three games today, Mike is looking forward to 2026.Writing via email, which you really need to be on nowadays, Mike says: “A sunny morning with high temp of 32 here in London, Canada but I still feel angst when I think of the 2026 World Cup.“While I might accept a trade-off of watching Russia - Saudi, Morocco - Iran, Costa Rica - Serbia etc to see matches like Portugal - Spain, I can’t imagine how bad it will be with 16 groups of 3 in 2026. If the bottom 6 teams are poor here what will the additional 16 teams be like? It would be completely shocking if any of the 16 seeded teams does’t proceed to knockout stage. “Anyway, I shall try to focus on the exciting matches to come this year and expect many good round of 16 games!”Andrew has been in touch with this beauty for some reason or other. It’s a great one, so I will stick it up. Maybe I should have left it to the end and walked out with this playing.The teams are in for the first game of the day...Can you tell the difference? Is that you, Dennis?Brazil’s coach Tite explains that Neymar might now be firing on all cylinders... Neymar is still not 100 per cent, but he is very privileged physically.The level he has displayed in his sprints in high velocity has been impressive. But still he has something to gain.It should happen sooner rather than later, hopefully.In many ways, there hasn’t been enough guff on Panama. Luckily, I provided some of that guff with this #EXCLUSIVE interview with your friend and mine, Jaime Penedo, their 131 times capped goalkeeper, who plies his trade at Dinamo Bucharest.

I have chosen to keep this on mute. The Costa Rica fans are readying themselves in Samara...Costa Rica will be hoping to do similar to the last World Cup, but sadly they won’t have to play anyone as awful as England’s 2014 vintage.The have, however, lost their last two warm-up games to England and Belgium, but coach Oscar Ramirez insists they will be better for that experience.“We need to improve the pressure we put on our opponents,” Ramirez chuckled.“That’s something that maybe cost us in our friendlies, especially in our last match where we had a hard time dealing with Belgium.“The first match in the World Cup is always crucial. We know Serbia press a lot in the first 20 minutes - we need to be able to handle this.“The first goal will be key.”I worked at ITV for a number of years (sorry) and I once suggested to the FA we could do a feature in the tournament ‘games room’ but was told this would not be possible as no one other than players and staff were allowed it. Now the media are playing darts and going bowling with the team, which is a huge change in dynamic.Meanwhile, in the England camp, Jordan Henderson has done a modern Facetime with an England fan who has raided his local flag store to decorate his estate. Regardless of what you think of the decor, it’s nice to see the England squad so relaxed during the tournament that they feel capable of doing stuff.Diego Maradona has given his version of an exchange with an Asian fan that witnesses perceived as racist. British television staff working in Spartak Stadium in Moscow during Argentina’s 1-1 draw with Iceland on Saturday reported seeing Maradona respond to South Korea fans calling his name.On Twitter, ITV presenter Jacqui Oatley posted that Maradona “obliged with a smile, kiss and wave. Then pulled his eyes to the side in a clearly racist gesture.” In a Facebook message early Sunday, the Argentina great says he saw “an Asian boy wearing an Argentina T-shirt.”He adds: “I, from afar, tried to tell them how nice it seemed to me that even the Asians cheer for us. And that’s all, guys, come on.” Fifa statutes prohibit acts of discrimination by teams, officials and fans at games it organises.Not the greatest of defences there from Diego.In a response to The Associated Press, Fifa refers to its anti-discrimination rules without commenting on the incident. Maradona also apologises for smoking a cigar in the VIP seats, despite a Fifa ban on smoking at World Cup stadiums.The blog does make a great Father’s Day gift. It’s cheap, requires no packaging (good for the environment) and it includes loads of football, which is what we all want. One assumes fathers will be visited later for some bonding over this mighty fine World Cup. Anyone got a decent gift from their offspring? I got nothing, mainly due to me having zero kids. My father, in turn, will receive two-course meal as a gift later, if he wants dessert he’ll have to pay himself.Anyway...away from the mistakes and Daniel’s Vitamix (please send me one in the post), we should get back to today’s action in Russia. Aleks Kolarov, famed for his thwacking of the football, is trying to get us all in the mood for Serbia’s grand clash with Costa Rica in a bit. If we play to our potential, are honest among ourselves, as we have been these three weeks, then we can do something.Sunday’s game will determine how important the subsequent games will be - I hope that we will get a good result and it will mean a lot if we win.I will tell the younger players to stay calm and enjoy their football because this is a huge opportunity for the 23 of us to represent our country.Qualifying for Russia was a great success, we are here on merit, but we are not going to be satisfied merely by being here, we want to go a step further.That Troost-Ekong bloke did not have a great evening against Croatia yesterday. I hope it had nothing to do with our interview last month...I will try to bring enjoyment but let’s not be too optimistic. One man more likely to bring entertainment is Paul Doyle, who has written about Tunisia.Anyway, that’s about me. Will Unwin will take over for the next little bit, so enjoy him. Bye! “Germany may not have a transcendent player - but does the Mannschaft need one?” asks Silke Sessler.“A team like Portugal certainly depends on a figure like Ronaldo. And we have all seen in 2014 how much Brazil depended then on Neymar. A team like Germany plays as a team. Mind you, I am not saying the Germans are going to win it! But what English fans seem to have a problem with is that Germany’s team works differently from a lot of other teams - the inidual is not of that much importance. We need good players, we have good players. They need the will to win it. I am not that sure about that, yet. They need team-spirit. We will have to see how much they have found themselves as a team.But do they need a lead-act? No. Anyone can become the lead-act in each game. If the opponent takes one player effectively out of the game (not talking unfair methods here, just a good working defence) another will step in. That is the strength of the team-approach.If you have one leading figure and that man gets injured or has a bad day or is caught out by the opponent’s defence, that is that.”I don’t have a problem with it at all - you win how you win. But most World Cups are won by teams with that inidual – Germany had Walter and Rahn in 1954, Beckenbauer and Muller in 1974, and Matthaus in 1990. They didn’t have that inidual in 2014, but the competition is better now. “When I was in my formative years I think I did reassess my life after some horribly wrong refereeing decisions,” emails Phil Grey. “I was 13 when Joe Jordan’s infamous handball won Scotland a crucial penalty against Wales. After all those children’s books and Disney films it does come as quite a shock when you see the villain get away with it and win in the end. And I was 18 when Harald Schumacher went totally unpunished for attacking Battiston. Those moments can actually change your worldview.”Luckily it’s only football. In politics, at least, the good guys always win. Yep, I too reckon we’re in for another feast of attacking football. Germany might scrounge one more and Serbia might not score at all. We’re football-146. Check this on Serbia, who feature in today’s first game. Iceland, then. They really know what they’re about, don’t they? What I love about them is how appalling annoying they must be to play against, like the kid in the playground who didn’t buy your dummies or feints but just got in the way, yet at the same time I’d quite enjoy watching them get gubbed 37-0. Here’s Darren Anderton, writing for us on playing in World Cups – Worlds Cup – and England starting against Tunisia. Belgium: absolutely cannot be trusted to win big games, never mind a succession of them. May well finish second in their group my dark horses. France: amazing squad, unamazing manager, look clueless, hope their good players will make something happen.Spain: best in possession but nowhere near as impregnable as when they had the greatest midfield of all-time. A serious contender, but a good team may well punish their defence.Germany: Know they can do it, lack a transcendent inidual. Brazil: Settled, have a star, but who knows how they’ll perform when it gets real. Argentina: Clueless, but have brilliant attackers and Messi. I’m going with Brazil and wouldn’t be shocked if it was Spain but would be relatively surprised were it any of the others, unless France fluke the correct combination of players. So who’s going to win the World Cup? My rationale is as follows:What’s your favourite blender? I have a Vitamix, and can’t recommend it highly enough. I have just procured myself some green juice because I am not yet mature enough to eat vegetables. In it one can find: kale, spinach, grapes, ginger, blueberries, cucumber, apples. Of these, ginger is the only one I would consume in non-liquidised form. I’d better stay away from freak yachting accidents, basically. I wrote about the wonder of football, the wonder of the World Cup, and what we can do about its specific circumstances on this occasion.Read an interview with reality TV star, John Barnes, who is thoughtful and interesting on race.Back to pluralisation:“Viduks” is one of my favourite football nicknames. Remind yourself of yesterday’s VAR romance.Stats versus Eyes dept: I thought Messi was crowded out yesterday, and if you miss a penalty at 1-1 – your chance to define the match – and it finishes 1-1, then you almost necessarily played badly because that’s how football works. Which isn’t to blame him for Argentina’s apparent lack of gameplan and wingers. Today is Jordan Henderson’s birthday. Hope old Gazzreth has got the jelly and ice cream in. I’ve just seen this that Jesseh Lingard said this: “Southgate has come in with the mentality to play with freedom, play without fear, and you will enjoy your time more. So, as a group of players that is what we are going to do, enjoy our football, play with no fear and play exciting football.”It’s hard not to wonder if he’s comparing. “Sky sources”, or “the internet” as it’s sometimes called, understand that Harrance Maguire will play for England tomorrow, not Garrance Cahill. And I guess that makes sense - Maguire is much better on the ball, and his team should have plenty of it. Other hand, Tunisia will defend deep and, I’ll be betting, concede a fair few corners. Cahill is one of the best defenders I’ve ever seen when it comes to attacking the opposition box, so might still have been useful. England have had some races in training – Sterling beat Alexander-Arnold – and they’ve also played some Kabaddi. Back in the day, West Bengal were my team.“I’m still fuming over a decision that went against Charlton in 2007,” tweets Richard Hunt. “TBF, the subsequent pain since that season might have something to do with it. I’ll seek help.”Yes - I feel you, but wonder if it’s the aformentioned pain about which you’re fuming rather than the decision itself. And no slacking on the bench either. Peru’s anthem was easily the best rendered so far. Adam Collins’ report from Sophia Gardens yesterday has a fair old bit of football #content. BREAKING NEWS: Middlesbrough have offered £5m for Sundarland’s Paddy McNair. More as I get it. Also in Russia...My own view on this: if a refereeing error, in a football match, is something which bothers you more than five minutes after the game has ended, then you might want to reassess your life. And I say that as someone who has and does dedicate significant swathes of their life to writing about, thinking about, watching and watching their team play football. VAR is really killing the tedium of tedious debate, isn’t it? Here’s Barney Ronay on that. Did you watch the Scotland ’78 doc on BBC? If not, you should and can, here.This, from the director, just made me chuckle. Sitting in a room on my bill. So what’s the state of play with this World Cup then? We’ve now seen eight games and only one of them’s been any use, but dearie me, how much use was it? More or less, that’s because it was a knockout played in the group stages, which bodes well. In 2014 and 2002, the group stages were excellent but the knockouts were mainly rubbish, which this time ought not to be so. We’ll get a decent selection of attacking teams who’ll back themselves, and it’s those knockouts that, in the end, determine whether or not a World Cup is a classic. There are some poor teams to filter first, but from the last 16 onwards there should be some belters.Nemanja Matic reckons Serbia will be focusing on the “details”. As someone who watched him a lot last season, I’d recommend that he also took note of the basics, such as “running fast” and “passing accurately”.

So why not go to the source, the original brain that figured all of this out?” says Professor Edith Hall. “I think there is a comfort in ideas that people have held for thousands of years.”Her book, Aristotle’s Way, promises to teach you “how ancient wisdom can change your life”, in particular how to achieve a lifelong state of what the ancients referred to as eudaimonia and we come closest to with “contentment”. According to Aristotle, Hall writes: “The ultimate goal of human life is, simply, happiness, which means finding a purpose in order to realise your potential and working on your behaviour to become the best version of yourself.” It’s an ancient version of that poster “Work Hard \u0026amp Be Nice to People”, but in a less cool font.Aristotle approves of food, drink and sex (all in moderation – he’s big on moderation) he believes leisure is more important than work that we all have innate talents and that we don’t peak until we’re 49. What’s not to like? But by far his most significant claim is that happiness is achievable by almost everyone – you just have to “decide to become happier”. Simple, huh! “Happiness is not a state as far as Aristotle is concerned, it’s an activity,” Hall explains. “You have to do it. It means every encounter and every day of your life and every decision you take, trying to do it in a measured and deliberated way until it becomes habitual.”Like anything, happiness just takes a bit of planning, Hall argues. “Plato, his teacher, said that the unconsidered life is not worth living. Aristotle would say the unplanned life is slightly less likely to be happy. It’s planning. Just planning.”With all the injunctions to become the Best Possible You, Hall clearly has an eye on the self-help market as well as both feet firmly in the classical world you almost expect to find a photo of a toga-clad Aristotle smiling beatifically over a slice of avocado toast. “Virtue ethics” doesn’t sound much fun, and Hall gamely breathes new life into his doctrines (which she admits can be heavy-going) for 21st-century readers, flitting over the centuries and across cultural borders, taking in everyone from Philip of Macedon to Pharrell Williams of “Happy” with breezy aplomb. A beguiling cross between Mary Beard and Mary Poppins, Hall is enjoying herself outside the ivory towers: “I love the idea that I’m now in agony aunt territory with Aristotle.”The daughter of an Anglican priest, Hall lost her faith when she was 13 and spent the rest of her teens in a “moral wilderness”. When the rest of us were experimenting with cigarettes and blue mascara, Hall dabbled in astrology, Buddhism and transcendental meditation in an attempt to answer her fundamental question – why be good? “If you don’t believe in an interventionist God or an afterlife, there is no logical reason whatsoever to be virtuous. Why would you not just pursue your own self-interest?” Then, as an undergraduate at Oxford, she discovered Aristotle: “I\u0026nbspdecided this was such an unbelievably commonsensical way of trying to organise your life. I\u0026nbspwas blown away. It was a total epiphany. So I just started doing it, as it were.”Planning and moderation aren’t the first qualities we associate with students, and Hall admits it was tricky at first. “It’s terribly grown-up to take complete responsibility.” And here Aristotle is characteristically forgiving, arguing that humans aren’t capable of consistent rational forethought until they are at least 25 (something now backed up by research, Hall points out). And it took her until her mid-30s to realise that if she wanted to fulfil her hopes of becoming a mother, she needed to stop dating “handsome lizards and moral invertebrates”. She now has two daughters, one of whom also loves history and who accompanied her on a tour of Greece in the footsteps of her hero.So what does doing it actually mean? Being nice is “not just a matter of enlightened self-interest”, Hall says. “There is an intrinsic wellspring of good feeling about yourself that does actually supply a feeling of contentment.” The examples she gives are making sure she always smiled at her children “however tired, however annoyed” she was, or taking a purse to the police station or lost property, “when the temptation might be to put it in your pocket… It may hurt a bit, but you just have to start making yourself do it.”If, like me, you come over all anxious at the idea of not handing in a purse, or apologise five times when someone else bumps into you, then you may be what Aristotle calls “an intuitive virtue ethicist”. Who knew? “Good for you!” says Hall, in a way that doesn’t sound so good. You can be “too nice” to be a true Aristotelian: not enough anger, for example, is a problem, especially for women. “It means you have no self-respect, will get walked all over and won’t look after your own. It’s not OK. You can’t be a fully moral person, actually.” Oh dear!One of the joys of Aristotle’s philosophy is that it works whatever your age, Hall believes. But she is evangelical – she describes herself as a “secular missionary” – on the need to offer moral guidance to young people, on those crucial everyday things you don’t get taught at school. “Taking a decision, clear communication, how to use your leisure, how to choose a partner and friends, and when it is absolutely fine to get rid of friends.”If it all sounds like doing what your mother always told you – smile, do your homework, everything in moderation, whatever! – there’s the rub: while we may have been well loved, Hall thinks we have not always been “well parented” we are failing our young by inadequately training them in basic decision-making skills. And so her book includes practical advice such as how to write a\u0026nbspdecent job application and when to dump your partner.What are her top three tips for getting in touch with your inner Aristotle?Number one: “Be honest – know your vices.” Hall provides a handy version of Aristotle’s inventory of character qualities, a sort of personality quiz. She identifies her own worse fault as vindictiveness. “I like to get back at people if they’ve hurt me or my loved ones. I\u0026nbspenjoy it,” she smiles dangerously. Now, as an enlightened Aristotelian she only goes “out for revenge when it is appropriate”.Number two: “Review all your relationships”, which should all be based “on full-blown reciprocal trust”, according to Aristotle. He has a system for dealing with friends and relatives who don’t come up to scratch – you simply demote them according to his categories “primary”, “pleasure” and “utility” (“I occasionally meet them for lunch,” Hall says of a couple of her relegated rellies). The latter might sound like something you have to assemble from Ikea, but it amicably encompasses most of our friendships.From your spouse to society at large, all relationships are contracts, apparently. What if your partner cheats on you? “I would always give them one more chance,” says Hall. On adultery, Aristotle “talks rather too often about the problem of fancying your neighbour’s wife”, she says. But his belief that if you abuse marital trust “you are actually rotting the foundations of society” has certainly helped her to be “a good girl”.Number three? “Think about your death. Look to the end,” Hall says emphatically. “Because it makes you get on with things. It’s about thinking of your life like a biographer while you are doing it, that your life is an art.”While the idea we can simply choose to be happy is seductive, it is rather in the “chinsocks-up, it’s-all-in-your-head” school of psychology. We can hardly blame Aristotle for being a little old-fashioned (he was also dodgy on women and slaves, which Hall excuses by arguing that he was always open to changing his mind).But taking responsibility for your own happiness will be of little comfort to the clinically depressed or recently bereaved. Hall agrees it can be difficult, but not impossible for people to find gratification after terrible tragedy, and ultimately, she says cheerfully, life is pretty bleak: “We are all in a waiting room. It’s just whether we decide to spend it trying to have a wonderful time with each other.”Aristotle’s Way by Edith Hall is published by Bodley Head at £20.

These are days on which I prefer to start cooking early, before the sun turns the kitchen into a furnace, and for which I need good-natured recipes that appreciate being taken from the oven and left to rest a while. I’m looking for dishes just as good served warm or even cold as they are straight from the oven.With this in mind, I did a lamb roast this week – a boned breast or two, stuffed with spinach, spring onions and feta cheese – that was as pleasing served warm as it was hot. The flavours reminded me of something I had eaten long ago, on holiday in Greece one very hot summer. The next day we carved it very, very thinly and ate it with a salad of lamb’s lettuce and green-shouldered tomatoes with a dressing of olive oil and enough white-wine vinegar to make our lips tingle.A second roast, of crisp-skinned duck and oranges, seemed all the better for being made an hour or so before we ate it. We folded the roast breast and leg meat, torn in fat chunks from its bones, through a bowl of stock-swollen couscous, then used the fat from the duck and juice from the roasted oranges as a dressing. It crossed my mind that this would be good with roast pork, too, or any meat with a generous amount of fat that can become part of the dressing.Whichever meat you choose, the result is a leisurely roast-cum-salad, which this time I folded through with a crisp tangle of sweet green pea shoots. (I could have used watercress or wild rocket crisped up in iced water.)Relaxed food for a great summer.Ask your butcher for breasts of lamb with the bones removed. It will speed up the process and save you an unnecessary half-hour of home butchery. When you add the cooked and drained peas to the roasting tin, turn them over in the pan juices from the roast – it will add much savour.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Remove the stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves thoroughly under cold running water. The leaves still wet, pile them into a deep pan over a moderate heat then cover tightly with a lid. Let the leaves cook for 2 or 3 minutes in their own steam, shaking the pan so they soften evenly. As soon as they are bright green and wilted, remove from the heat and plunge into iced water. Squeeze the leaves to remove the water, then chop them roughly and set them aside in a bowl.Roughly chop the mint leaves, then add them to the spinach, together with a generous seasoning of black pepper.Roughly chop the spring onions, then let them soften in the olive oil in a shallow pan over a medium heat. Add the spring onions to the spinach, crumble in the feta cheese in small lumps, then mix lightly.Lay the breasts of lamb flat on a work surface and spread the spinach filling over them, leaving a small rim of meat around the edges, then roll them up and secure with butcher’s string. Place the rolled breasts in a roasting tin, rub them lightly with olive oil and crumbled sea salt, then roast them for one hour. Remove them from the oven and leave them to rest, covered with foil.Cook the peas in boiling, lightly salted water for a few minutes until tender, then drain them and tip them into the tin around the lamb. Carve the lamb into thick slices and serve.I see no reason why this recipe wouldn’t work perfectly neatly with chicken, but the point of using duck is to harness all the glorious fat that assembles in the roasting tin, spiked with the juices of the warm orange.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the pieces of duck in a roasting tin and slash them, just deep enough to go through the skin and fat, every 3 or 4 cm. Peel and halve the shallots lengthways, then add them to the tin, together with the orange cut in half, and leave them to roast in the preheated oven for about an hour. They are ready when the skin is lightly crisp. Remove and set aside.Bring the stock to the boil. Put the couscous in a large mixing bowl then pour over the boiled stock, cover with a lid and set aside for about 15 minutes until the water has been absorbed by the grains of couscous. Squeeze the roast orange halves over the couscous. Break up the shallots and stir them into the couscous, then check the seasoning, adding salt and black pepper.Tear the duck to pieces – torn pieces look better than chopped – then fold them into the couscous. Wash and shake dry the pea shoots then toss them with the parsley and coriander leaves. Fold the herbs and shoots into the couscous and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15915999a90cc714357e54fdc9c1c54294b6c3/220_302_5139_6420/master/5139.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19vcGluaW9ucy5wbmc\u0026amp;s=a5c429861ca66bb6cb8858a851a9bd0f","title":"this years bikinis are built for love island not center  parcs","story":"You really have to have the body of someone built for nothing but bikini wearing not to feel ridiculous in this summer’s garments, writes Eva WisemanLast weekend, I saw hell in a Topshop mirror. Hours I spent, whole ironed-out hours – time would go very slowly and then very fast and suddenly it was 5pm – in the changing rooms of a selection of high-street shops, trying on swimming costumes. I was going to Center Parcs on the Monday you see (by the time this is published I will have enjoyed a week with three generations of my partner’s family under its magical dome), and had been wearing the same bikini since I was 18. I needed something that would not slide off on a slide.So I started by strolling among the racks with my usual meditative glee at being among so many possibilities of transformation, many of them neon, and entered the changing rooms feeling good, feeling fine, feeling like a person, with a body, who might take it swimming on Monday. That feeling lasted until I stepped into the first swimsuit and yes, saw hell. A waterproof apocalypse.If I might take a moment to talk about my body? It’s a sort of meaty trunk of flesh, with everything, I thought, largely where it should be, ie 1 x belly, 2 x nipples, 2 x legs, 2 x arms, etc, the former in the middle, the latter closer to the edge. If there were a size 11, it would be that, neither obese nor emaciated, sturdy, effective, and yet, it turns out, entirely the wrong shape for a swimming costume. To begin with, the gussets. Usually there’s a selection of bottoms, from shorts to thongs, but this year, the fashion is for a very narrow chocolate eclair sort of shape that extends between the legs and up towards the belly button, requiring even the blondest of women to depilate almost an acre of flesh. So that’s the gussets.But I was prepared for that, and indeed had taken it into consideration when selecting swimsuits, leaving behind a number of costumes that, rather than offer a covering for one’s genitals, instead provided a sort of will-this-do mental floss, like a hastily erected crucifix to show where one has buried the cat. But even the kinder gussets provided only a suggestion of arse coverage, the designer perhaps having never seen a human bottom, instead having only studied medical charts about digestion.I’ve always enjoyed a bikini. No longer. Today’s bikinis are created only for people such as Love Island contestants, for whom the ability to wear a bikini with confidence is the basis of their career. Purchasing one is as ridiculous as, say, a chef buying a chisel – it is the wrong tool for the job. Haters are going to say, “Didn’t she have a baby? Isn’t she in her mid to late-30s with a largely sedentary lifestyle? Isn’t that why she can’t find a flattering bikini?” To them I’d say, yes yes, but surely even the most Hobnobbed of us should be encouraged to swim? Should expect that, at the very least, a bikini should contain the rudest parts of our body, rather than, as these ones did, offer the merest suggestion of coverage, and that’s standing up. Lying down in one of these fabric panic rooms made of three Doritos threaded together with a kind of lurid vine would cause a whole body to puddle beneath the sun lounger.Bikinis though – bikinis, we’ve all held a women’s magazine in June, we all know that we must protect the world from the sight of women in bikinis after the age of 28, what was I thinking? Twist! After a day’s research I can confirm that this season’s all-in-one swimsuits are by far the more obscene choice. They are cut narrowly, to expose the erotic “side-boob”, but if you are larger than a B cup, then they offer a whole teapot of tit to your neighbouring bather. Nothing is adjustable nothing is safe. At any point you might look to your left and greet an entire breast or buttock that has escaped and has been enjoying your conversation with the waiter for some time, just so so pleased with itself.There is a trend, this year, for “cut-outs”. These are shapes hacked out of swimsuits in unlikely places to add interest and mystery – is it a swimming costume, is it a bikini? Who knows! The result, apart from inevitable tanning complications, is a costume with built-in landmines – step carefully, women of 2018, for these cut-outs are liable to take a whole breast off. While also creating little pouches of excitable flesh that will burst through the nylon like summer hernias, hello! Hello, I love you!I travelled home gingerly, in this body that had been exposed to me as trouble, resigned to a holiday sat by the side, cheering the children on. Waving with a hand now revealed to me as a swollen meat puppet, balanced on the end of something wobbly, attached to a machine so complicated and mottled that it should not be driven in public, and certainly not in water. Thanks to this season’s swimwear, Center Parcs slides will be safe from the groaning problem of my body, for this year at least.After I wrote about migraines, hundreds wrote in suggesting cures, including coffee, magnesium, therapy and fasting.

In January, all extra charges for using a credit or debit card to pay for goods and services were banned to prevent nasty surprises at the checkout. However, five months on, increases in the cost of transactions by Visa and Mastercard mean consumers now face the prospect of paying more for goods and services.UK traders have to pay £1bn extra a year to Visa alone, after the US-owned giant doubled its fees for every card payment. This means smaller retailers are, in turn, being forced to increase their prices to cover the extra charges, thus undermining January’s surcharge ban.Every time a customer uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase, the trader has to pay a proportion to the bank – known as the “acquirer” – that processes the payment. Part of this, called the “merchant service charge”, is an “interchange” fee, which the bank then passes on to the card issuer – usually the customer’s bank.Other parts are a charge levied by the “acquiring bank” to cover the cost of processing the transaction, and a “card scheme fee” that goes to Visa or Mastercard. The fees fluctuate.In 2015, the EU introduced rules to cap increasingly high interchange fees. It was on the back of these reforms that UK traders have been banned from charging customers a levy at the checkout.Before the ban, customers could see the extra charge for using a card and had the option of choosing a cheaper payment method, whereas now everyone has to shoulder the cost, whether they use cash or card.“It’s a classic example of the unintended consequences of regulation,” says James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance. “All the regulator has done is squeeze one end of the balloon, and made the other end bigger.”Some traders may be forced to stop accepting cards or close, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents UK shops. “As consumers do not pay to use their cards, there is little awareness of increasing fees, but they – like any other cost – are ultimately paid for by the consumer,” it says. “As card fees have increased, retailers are faced with a choice of raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive.”According to CMSPI, a payments consultancy that advises traders, the fees are likely to rise further. As its chief economist, Callum Godwin, explains, it’s the smaller businesses that are likely to be hit hardest. “The latest increases have been targeted at those with a low average transaction value, such as local cafes and corner shops, hitting the weakest when the high street is already suffering,” he says.“Visa and Mastercard are forcing up the cost of accepting cards without justification in order to boost their profits and they know that their cards are so widely used it has become near-impossible for merchants to refuse to accept them.”So far, however, the PSR has dragged its heels. It says that at the launch of its annual plan in March, “we outlined that a variety of observations had been raised about different aspects of card payments and that, in the year ahead, we will be taking a deeper look at how this market works”. It adds that details of the investigation have yet to be finalised.Visa and Mastercard deny profiteering at the expense of retailers, but both refuse to disclose card scheme fees. “The figures quoted are misleading and overinflated,” Visa says. “Our pricing means we can invest in world-leading cyber security and consumer protection, in innovation such as contactless and mobile payments, and in providing a global network which enables billions to make purchases safely, securely and reliably.”Mastercard tells the Observer that its services increase custom for businesses and its fees represent the smallest percentage of the merchant service charge. “As with any payment method there are associated costs,” it says. “Our fees reflect the clear value of accepting Mastercard and the significant investment we have made in payment technology and security.”Customers have embraced the convenience of plastic without realising the hidden costs. Before the surcharge ban, they could see how much extra they would have to pay to use a credit or debit card at the checkout and opt to use a different method to avoid the charge. Now, as the costs are fed into high street prices, they are undetectable and unavoidable and affect cash as well as card payers.Earlier this month the government finished a consultation on the future of digital payments including the cost of card payments. Meanwhile, the European commission is reviewing the effects of the interchange fee regulations on costs, and CMSPI has launched a Europe-wide petition for it to include scheme fees.However, campaigners are calling on the UK regulator to take immediate action to protect the high street. “There has been shocking regulatory failure,” says Mark Falcon, former director of regulation and strategy with the PSR and founder of the financial consultancy Zephyre.“Instead, the money has been erted to scheme fees, which go to Visa and Mastercard as profit, and the regulator should take action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cbe937bac6126a2275d41810996d486e37ec701/0_319_4791_2875/master/4791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f42e60043fa863d15d0e99f8ade9967d","title":"haim sisters tour alana danielle este dublin","story":"Haim do a fine line in what you can only call “Haim karaoke”. Night three of the UK leg of the LA band’s Sister Sister Sister tour finds the lead singer and guitarist Danielle Haim suffering from flu. We know this because her younger sister, Alana Haim, is telling us – while “hiding” behind the silent Danielle, and using mime hand gestures to make it look like Danielle is talking. A doctor has prescribed Danielle strict bed rest. (“Awwww,” says the crowd.)Alana’s hand, however, flips a V at the notion of bed rest, and at cancelling Haim’s two sold-out Dublin gigs. The LA three-piece (with two more in the live line-up) play on tonight – but without the vocals of their lead singer, who, despite a sleek purple suit, looks at her least Californian tonight: grey-pale. You imagine the band are hoping to conserve Danielle’s vocal cords for the two more sold-out nights they are to play at London’s Alexandra Palace at the weekend, where a total of 20,000 tickets were snapped up quickly, despite the middling sales performance of the band’s second album, Something to Tell You.There’s an odd disconnect too, tonight, between speaking out and shutting up: Danielle is finding herself muted on the day the news hits that the band sacked their former booking agent when they discovered that Haim had been paid 10 times less for a festival performance than a male act just one line up the billing.So this set’s vocals are ided up between Alana (youngest sister, keyboard and guitar) and Este (eldest sister, on bass and enduringly hokey facial expressions). Back in February, Este was briefly rechristened “mystery drunk woman” at the Brit awards, after she made faces when Liam Payne, a former boy band member, and Cheryl, a singer who has been often married, were being interviewed. (“Not drunk, just living my truth,” Este later tweeted.)Este kicks off the whole Haim-sing-the-songs-of-Haim scenario with Falling, from the band’s widely adored 2013 debut album, Days Are Gone, while Alana takes the reins on Don’t Save Me, another debut album throwback. Back and forth they go, through a set that flies by in a blur of word-perfect crowd singalongs and onstage repartee. There is a show-must-go-on feel here, born from the sisters’ past as a family covers band. And there is an argument that Haim’s harmonies are so ever-present, it doesn’t make all that much difference who is singing lead.You do miss Danielle, though, who confines herself to eloquent guitar solos, the odd bit of drum-bashing and mouthing the words enthusiastically. All the Haim sisters are multi-instrumentalists who sing, and most Haim songs have multiple vocal parts, the better to meld the harmonies of 90s R\u0026ampB and 70s west coast rock – their special superpower. The tonal absence of Danielle is disorienting, rather than disastrous, but there is a marked difference: the middle Haim packs a gravitas her two sisters lack.Alana seizes the spotlight tonight. Demanding Guinness – not a tactic likely to alienate a Dublin crowd – she tells the tale of how she advocated for the song that eventually became the first single from Something to Tell You. Her sisters didn’t like it, though, until Alana – dialling up the youngest sibling angst – came up with a chord that transformed the song. Este then “sprinkles some truth” on “this bullshit sundae” – apparently, all the song needed was slap bass and a wise head. It all builds up very slickly to Want You Back, a song packed with emotional IQ and vocal interplay Alana handles the lead.If we’re going granular, Este “does” Danielle marginally more convincingly than Alana. Her range runs deeper, with an added measure of huskiness. Her closing take on Right Now is, perhaps, the song of the night, with added extemporisations about exes who blow hot and cold.But Right Now and its equally lush album-mates only point up the conundrum why Something to Tell You didn’t quite hit the ubiquity of Days Are Gone. Second albums often suffer after shock of the new is gone. Perhaps the gap between the two records – four years – was a major factor in these gadfly times. It was later revealed that one major reason Haim’s second was delayed was that Danielle’s other half – super-producer Ariel Rechtshaid – had been diagnosed with testicular cancer no one was in the mood to produce breezy AOR about the minutiae of relationships for some time.Rechtshaid, though, has recovered. And now Haim seem poised to take on their rightful place as the summer festival band in excelsis, with – hopefully – their lead singer back front and centre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5a0778b58f9c922730ea5f257d84ff61312071/0_231_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2dec0cfcd0af3d12f13734745e99a73","title":"labour live for the few not the many","story":"JezFest got off to a slow start but revolution was in the air – among Remainers challenging Corbyn’s Brexit stanceThere was a moment, an hour before Jeremy Corbyn took to the stage at the Labour Live festival, when he might have believed himself a rock star. The Labour leader, in his short sleeved linen shirt and his pale chinos, checking his pockets for his speech and his reading specs, was shuffled through the crowd by three burly security guards, barking into walkie talkies. The crowd duly parted, before chasing him en masse the few yards across White Hart Lane Park as he was bustled backstage. Three teenage girls started scrolling, screaming, to see if they had caught the great man doing his trademark pop-eyed grin on their selfies.This is presumably the kind of excitement that the Labour organisers had envisaged when they promoted #Jezfest as an alternative Glastonbury. You would think after the party’s history with such jamborees – that takes in Kinnock’s Sheffield Rally, and the Millennium Eve fiasco in the Dome – that they might have learned to keep well clear of any event involving wristbands. For much of the day yesterday, they might have been wishing they had.When the gates opened at noon there was no festival stampede toward the main stage mosh pit, rather a steady stroll, followed by a laying out of tartan picnic rugs and folding camping chairs. In this, it seemed that the event had something of the authentic character of its headline act, even if that actually made it more village fete than Sandinista rally. One of the obvious problems of performing under the slogan of “For the Many” is when only a few of them turn up.After a week in which Labour seems to have lost momentum in the polls – despite the tragic ineptitude of the government – and in which 90 of its MPs had defied the whip over Brexit, the leadership clearly wanted to avoid a damp squib of a summer festival at all costs. Labour Live was conceived as a vehicle to channel the great surge of youth support that Jeremy Corbyn in particular enjoyed around last year’s general election. The lack of enthusiasm that had very publicly dogged this event, ever since it was announced must have left organisers praying for rain, so at least they could blame the weather.As it was, the sun mostly shone on the three very large tents and the main stage and on the queue forming outside the Unite the Union ice cream van that was giving out free 99s and playing a hurdy-gurdy version of the Red Flag. There was no visible revolt over the fact that half the crowd had coughed up £35 for their entry and the other half had been bussed in for free after the Labour party started desperately giving out tickets to make up the numbers. The growing sense that the leadership should not be reliably left in charge of party organisation at a brewery was compounded by the fact that the Workers Beer Company refused to provide keg versions of its product, because they were “reserved for high-volume events”.Using the Sean Spicer method of calculation, by early afternoon the park was filled as far as the eye could see: there were probably 3,000 people enjoying the afternoon events that included a People’s Question Time with Len McCluskey (a prelude to his hosting of hip-hop karaoke at tea time). Tottenham’s local MP David Lammy did his best as a warm-up man for a muted crowd. Speaking to him afterwards he suggested that his experience of festivals was that it would only “really get going later”. “I didn’t have the best slot of the day,” he suggested, loyally, “that is for Jeremy and Clean Bandit”.In The World Transformed tent activists were reaching out to a reluctant few dozen people on benches by trying to involve them in a game of “socialist runaround”. First question: “Jeremy Hunt is rhyming slang, agree or disagree?” Second question: “Will Labour take us back to the 1970s?” (This one came with a supplementary – “and would that be a bad thing?”) Final question: “Should we allow shareholders to make a profit?” Runaround now!More of the crowd flocked to the literary tent where there was a grown-up discussion of whether Corbyn’s socialism was a viable vision, led by the ’s Gary Younge. For a festival that was promoting free debate, however, it was hard to avoid the sense that there were one or two clear limits.Outside I met a few young representatives of For our Future’s Sake who were planning a “friendly protest” against the party’s refusal to have a proper debate on Brexit policy. They were planning to unfurl a pro-Remain banner when Corbyn took the stage, though they feared their banner might be confiscated by Momentum heavies.When – after an introductory DJ set that included Prince’s I Wanna Be Your Lover – the leader appeared, the banner was raised, and the Remain group and their banner were quickly ushered out. This allowed the leader of the opposition to enthuse a by-now significantly larger crowd of the converted with impassioned pledges to renationalise “rail, mail and water”, build a million council homes and to “support everybody”, while fans chorused his “Ooh! Jeremy Corbyn” theme tune. Like any headliner worth his salt, he knows to stick to the hits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f128ea104ad0f2efb7937d3a1b140f63e1792e8/0_167_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7adeee73ecdc6e8d56bf9cb98536587e","title":"leftwing group pushes for uk to stay in the eu at odds with jeremy corbyn","story":"Student organisation NCAFC says it will join anti-Brexit demonstrations this summerA leftwing organisation that led demonstrations against student fees and Conservative higher education reforms has set itself at odds with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit by pledging to increase its campaigns to keep the UK in the EU and maintain the free movement of workers.The National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) said it would join anti-Brexit demonstrations the National Union of Students (NUS) is organising this summer and autumn, and establish a “radical, leftwing, pro-migrant bloc”. The move is another sign of young people increasingly mobilising against the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU in March next year.The NCAFC coordinated action and street protests by thousands of students against university fees in 2010 and 2011, and later actions during the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition government against its wider higher education policies. Christie Neary, a member of the NCAFC national committee, said it was time Corbyn joined the battle to stop Brexit.“The only Brexit is a Tory Brexit – a racist attack on migrants and workers’ rights. Jeremy Corbyn knows that bankrupt hospitals, low pay and failing schools are the fault of bosses and relentless austerity, not migrants. Labour can’t afford to give any more ground to the right. It’s time Corbyn committed to the defence of free movement and workers, and that means leading the campaign to stop Brexit altogether,” Neary said.As the party stages its “Jezfest” music festival in north London on Saturday, pressure from pro-EU Labour supporters for the party to take a clearer anti-Brexit line is growing.MPs and remain activists want the party to abandon its policy of “constructive ambiguity” after Corbyn faced his biggest Commons rebellion by backbenchers last week on a motion about staying in the European Economic Area (EEA).Student organisations representing almost a million young people studying at UK universities and colleges joined forces last month to demand a “people’s vote” on any final Brexit deal as fears grow that leaving the EU will have a disastrous effect on their future prospects.The NCAFC is not formally linked to Labour, but many of its supporters are Corbyn supporters. The rebellion by Labour MPs happened after party whips ordered them to abstain over a motion that backed staying in the EEA. The Labour leadership objected partly because of concerns that membership would mean obeying free movement rules after Brexit, and also because it might make it difficult for the UK to join a customs union and therefore find a solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.Concerns that the party’s stance on Brexit is hitting its support grew on Thursday when Labour’s Janet Daby won the the Lewisham East by-election but with a severely reduced majority. "},{"url":null,"title":"peppa pig youtube weird algorithms automated content","story":"James Bridle’s essay on disturbing YouTube content aimed at children went viral last year. Has the problem gone away – or is it getting worse?In November of last year, I read an article in the New York Times about disturbing videos targeted at children that were being distributed via YouTube. Parents reported that their children were encountering knock-off editions of their favourite cartoon characters in situations of violence and death: Peppa Pig drinking bleach, or Mickey Mouse being run over by a car. A brief Google of some of the terms mentioned in the article brought up not only many more accounts of inappropriate content, in Facebook posts, newsgroup threads, and other newspapers, but also disturbing accounts of their effects. Previously happy and well-adjusted children became frightened of the dark, prone to fits of crying, or displayed violent behaviour and talked about self-harm – all classic symptoms of abuse. But despite these reports, YouTube and its parent company, Google, had done little to address them. Moreover, there seemed to be little understanding of where these videos were coming from, how they were produced – or even why they existed in the first place.I’m a writer and artist, with a focus on the broad cultural and societal effects of new technologies, and this is how most of my obsessions start: getting increasingly curious about something and digging deeper, with an eye for concealed infrastructures and hidden processes. It’s an approach that has previously led me to investigate Britain’s system of deportation flights or its sophisticated road surveillance network, and this time it took me into the weird, surreal, and often disturbing hinterland of YouTube’s children’s videos. And these videos are worrying on several levels. As I spent more and more time with them, I became perturbed not just by their content, but by the way the system itself seemed to reproduce and exacerbate their most unsavoury excesses, preying on children’s worst fears and bundling them up into nightmare playlists, while blindly rewarding their creators for increasing their view counts even as the videos themselves descended into meaningless parodies and nonsensical stories.For adults, it’s the sheer weirdness of many of the videos that seems almost more disturbing than their violence. This is the part that’s harder to explain – and harder for people to understand – if you don’t immerse yourself in the videos, which I’d hardly recommend. Beyond the simple knock-offs and the provocations exists an entire class of nonsensical, algorithm-generated content millions and millions of videos that serve merely to attract views and produce income, cobbled together from nursery rhymes, toy reviews, and cultural misunderstandings. Some seem to be the product of random title generators, others – so many others – involve real humans, including young children, distributed across the globe, acting out endlessly the insane demands of YouTube’s recommendation algorithms, even if it makes no sense, even if you have to debase yourself utterly to do it.When I wrote an essay about the videos online, the public reaction largely mirrored my own. On the one hand, people were horrified to find out that these videos existed, and on the other, completely weirded out by the sheer scale and strangeness of what they found. The combination sent the article viral: it was shared and read online millions of times, picked up by websites and newspapers around the world, and even resulted in questions being asked in the European parliament. Finally, YouTube started to respond, although its efforts, and the results, have been mixed.YouTube’s initial proposal was to restrict advertising on disturbing content aimed at children – but its proposals failed to engage honestly with its own platform. It’s estimated that 400 hours of content are uploaded to the site every minute. Policing it by hand is impossible instead, YouTube relies on flagging by viewers to drive official review – which is hardly suitable when the first people to view this stuff are small children, and the damage is already done. YouTube has also touted the technological cure-all of machine learning as its preferred solution – but in April, it finally agreed that the dedicated YouTube Kids app would switch to entirely human moderation, effectively admitting that the approach didn’t work.As a result, while many videos have since been removed from the website, uncountable numbers still remain. In March, Wired catalogued a slew of violent accounts and demonstrated that it was possible to go from a popular children’s alphabet video to a Minnie Mouse snuff film in 14 steps, just by following YouTube’s own recommendations. As of last week, Googling the title of one of the now-removed videos mentioned in the New York Times article (“PAW Patrol Babies Pretend to Die Suicide by Annabelle Hypnotized”) results in a link to a near-identical video still hosted on the site (“PAW PATROL Babies Pretend To Die MONSTER HANDS From MIRROR! Paw Patrol Animation Pups Save For Kids”), in which the adorable pups don a freakish clip-art monster mask to terrify one another before being lured off a rooftop by a haunted doll. Is “Save For Kids” supposed to read “Safe For Kids”? Either way, it is not, and it’s obvious that just playing whack-a-mole with search terms and banned accounts is never going to solve entangled problems of copyright infringement, algorithmic recommendation, and ad-driven monetary incentives on a billion-view platform with no meaningful human oversight.Whether these videos are deliberately malicious, “merely” trolling, or the emergent effect of complex systems, isn’t the point. What’s new is that the system in which such violence proliferates is right in front of us, and visibly complicit, if we choose to see it for what it is. I titled that original essay “Something is wrong on the internet” because it seemed and still seems to me that the issues made glaringly obvious by the scandal are not limited to children’s content, nor to YouTube. First among these is how systems of algorithmic governance, rather than leading us towards the sunny uplands of equality and empowerment, continually re-enact and reinforce our existing prejudices, while oppressing those with the least understanding of, and thus power over, the systems they’re enmeshed in.Take YouTube’s recommendation system for starters, which doesn’t differentiate between Disney movies and a grainy animation cooked up by a bot farm in China. Essentially what the seemingly benign “if you like that, you’ll like this” mechanism is doing is training young children – practically from birth – to click on the first thing that comes along, regardless of the source. This is the same mechanism that sees Facebook slide fake political ads and conspiracy theories into the feeds of millions of disaffected voters, and the outcome – ever more extreme content and ided viewpoints – is much the same. Add the sheer impossibility of working out where these videos come from (most are anonymous accounts with thousands of barely differentiated uploads) and the viewer is adrift in a sea of existential uncertainty, which starts to feel worryingly familiar in a world where opaque and unaccountable systems increasingly control critical aspects of our everyday lives.In the months since first writing about YouTube’s weird video problem, I’ve met a few people from the company, as well as from other platforms that have been caught up in similar vortices. While most are well-meaning, few seem to have much of a grasp of the wider structural issues in society which their systems both profit from and exacerbate. Like most people who work at big tech companies, they think that these problems can be solved by the application of more technology: by better algorithms, more moderation, heavier engineering. Many outside the tech bubble – particularly in the west and in higher income brackets – are simply appalled that anyone would let their kids use YouTube in the first place. But we won’t fix these issues by blaming the companies, or urging them do better, just as we won’t solve the obesity crisis by demonising fast food but by lifting people out of poverty. If YouTube is bridging a gap in childcare, the answer is more funding for childcare and education in general, not fixing YouTube.What’s happening to kids on YouTube, to defendants in algorithmically enhanced court trials, and to poor debtors in Australia, is coming for all of us. All of our jobs, life support systems, and social contracts are vulnerable to automation – which doesn’t have to mean actually being replaced by robots, but merely being at their mercy. YouTube provides another salutary lesson here: only last week it was reported that YouTube’s most successful young stars – the “YouTubers” followed and admired by millions of their peers – are burning out and breaking down en masse. Polygon magazine cited, among many others, the examples of Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, the third most popular YouTuber in the world with just under 30 million subscribers, who recently went live to talk to his viewers about fears of an impending breakdown and his decision to take a break from YouTube, and Elle Mills, a popular YouTuber with 1.2 million followers, who posted footage of herself mid-anxiety attack in a video entitled Burn Out at 19.It would be easy to scoff at these young celebrities, were it not for the fact that their experience is merely the most charismatic example of the kind of algorithmic employment under which many others already labour. The characteristics, after all, are the same: long hours without holidays, benefits, or institutional support, and the pressure to work at the pace of the machine in a system whose goals and mechanisms are unclear and ever-changing, and to which its subjects have no appeal. (In a depressing twist, many of these same YouTubers have been hit by declines in revenue caused directly by YouTube’s attempts to demonetise “inappropriate” content for children – solving one problem in the system only exacerbates others.)The weirdness of YouTube videos, the extremism of Facebook and Twitter mobs, the latent biases of algorithmic systems: all of these have one thing in common with the internet itself, which is that – with a few dirty exceptions – nobody intentionally designed them this way. This is perhaps the strangest and most salutary lesson we can learn from these examples, if we choose to learn at all. The weirdness and violence they produce seems to be in direct correlation to how little we understand their workings – and how much is hidden from us, deliberately or otherwise, by the demands of efficiency and ease of use, corporate and national secrecy, and sheer, planet-ning scale. We live in an age characterised by the violence and breakdown of such systems, from global capitalism to the balance of the climate. If there is any hope for those exposed to its excesses from the cradle, it might be that they will be the first generation capable of thinking about global complexity in ways that increase, rather than reduce, the agency of all of us.James Bridle is the author of New Dark Age, (Verso, £16.99).

That’s one explanation, at least, for the current explosion in political podcasting. Brexit, the rise of the spectacularly unpredictable Donald Trump, the spread of far-right and far-left populism – all feed a hunger to understand what’s going on and a feeling that it isn’t safe to fall too far behind the news. Something similar happened in the immediate aftermath of the credit crunch, when the realisation that something life-changing had evidently been going on beneath our noses prompted a thirst for anything – books, public lectures, documentaries – that helped readers get to grips with a bewildering world of sub-prime lending and quantitative easing. Now it’s knowing your hard border from your hard backstop, or pondering whether the porn star Stormy Daniels or the Mueller investigation into Russian electoral interference has the greater chance of bringing Trump down.But the particular genius of podcasts is that they give the listener back a sense of control over a news cycle that is beginning to feel overwhelming. We are bombarded around the clock with information, from print, TV, radio and social media drowning in ideas and arguments and opinions, struggling to separate the signal from the noise. Dwindling audiences for flagship political programming such as Radio 4’s Today programme, meanwhile, suggest many listeners are discovering there’s only so many doom-laden stories they can take before breakfast.But the best podcasts distil everything you want to know into one manageable weekly catchup, to be downloaded and listened to whenever you want: out for a run, in the car, while doing the ironing. And like radio, good podcasts make good company. They burble along in the background much of the time, but every now and then your ears prick up at something.Admittedly, the political versions are unlikely to topple Love Island: The Morning After from the top of the iTunes chart – although episodes of the ’s Politics Weekly podcast and the BBC’s Political Thinking With Nick Robinson both made the top 100 in last week’s rankings – but the potential audience is growing all the time. A quarter of Britons have listened to a podcast in the past month, according to a recent report from podcasting specialists Acast, and on average these listeners spend more than three and a half hours a week on podcasts. Since they are cheap to make, they are also – at least in theory – a promising vehicle for political views that don’t always find\u0026nbsptheir\u0026nbspway easily into conventional media.That has been a gift to Jeremy Corbyn’s impatient outriders, chafing at what they see as the mainstream media’s continued scepticism about the Labour leader and reluctance to grant the radical left a platform. Shows like the slick Reel Politik, featuring a revolving cast of young Corbynistas being endlessly rude about the other half of the Labour party, or Agitpod – hosted by  writer Owen Jones and Ellie Mae O’Hagan – fill what they see as a yawning gap in conventional coverage and focus more closely on grassroots leftwing activism and ideas.But the format allows even conventional journalists to escape the confines of a normal news bulletin, whether that means ing deeper into the technical detail (as on the BBC’s Brexitcast, with the engagingly nerdy Chris Mason and Adam Fleming) or bringing some irreverence to the party. Chopper’s Brexit Podcast, chaired by the ’s Christopher Hope, is a very different beast from the pro-European Remainiacs podcast – one is a hotbed of Leaver gossip, while the other lives up to its mission to “own the Remoan” – but both are relaxed, cheeky and occasionally mischievous.Podcasting has its weaknesses, chiefly a tendency to self-indulgence. The downside of having more time for exploring ideas is that contributors who adore the sound of their own voices can ramble on for way too long. There are also surprisingly few women hosts – if anything, podcasting can be even more pale, male and stale than conventional political journalism – and now that every media outlet feels compelled to produce their own, it’s getting harder to pick out the gems.So here is the Observer’s guide to 10 of the best, from the elegantly intellectual to the distinctly raucous. Getting plugged into politics has never been easier.Reasons to Be CheerfulEd Miliband is Labour MP for Doncaster North and the former leader of the Labour party. He co-hosts the Reasons to Be Cheerful podcast with broadcaster Geoff Lloyd, who he met when the latter interviewed him during the election. They record it in Geoff’s loft, attracting about 70,000 listeners a week. How did the podcast start?Geoff came to me and said: “I think people are incredibly depressed because of Brexit, Trump, all that, but there must be some more good ideas out there. Why don’t we do something that says there’s a positive, optimistic way to change the country?” I’d been wanting since the election to find a way to promote and think about big ideas. Maybe in the old days I’d have started a thinktank or something, but this gives us a way of showing the ideas to a larger audience.Does it allow you to be more yourself than frontline politics did?There are inevitable constraints being leader of the opposition, which you don’t get being a backbench MP. But having said that, I was probably too constrained, and you learn. Lots of people say on Twitter: “Ooh, where was this Ed in 2015?”, which obviously drives me bananas. But it partly has some truth in it and partly it’s those\u0026nbspconstraints.Favourite episode?The first was on universal basic income and there’s something about the bigness of that idea… the bigger and more transformative they are, they’re the ones I’ve liked the best.Who should listen?People who want to be cheerful. What I’ve learned is if you think of any problem, there will be a solution happening in some part of Britain or another country. Take homelessness: there’s this thing in Finland called Housing First, that’s made a massive difference so we talked to a guy from Finland about how they eliminated homelessness. We did a woman from Boston about their gender pay law. So, people who think there are problems and they can be solved, people across the political spectrum – we do get emails saying: “I’m a Tory, I’d never have voted for you, but I like some of the ideas.”What other podcasts do you like?Pod Save America, Brexitcast, David Runciman’s Talking Politics and Fortunately…, the Jane GarveyFi Glover one. And Slow Burn, an eight-part thing about Watergate – you might think you know everything about Watergate, but it’s absolutely\u0026nbspbrilliant.Who will be prime minister in a year’s\u0026nbsptime?Pass on that. I gave up the predictions business in 2015.Interview by Gaby HinsliffUnHerdAyesha Hazarika hosts this podcast for the website UnHerd. She’s a former special adviser for the Labour party, a standup comedian and author of Punch and Judy Politics: An Insider’s Guide to Prime Minster’s Questions.Why listen?It’s a really broad range of people and subjects. In a lot of political panel discussions, you hear the same topics being regurgitated, but we ask our guests to pick stories they think are important but under-reported. There’s quite a strong international slant we do a lot on tech, data, things like artificial intelligence too.Do political podcasts resonate outside the bubble?I think there’s a small market of listeners, but they’re quite committed. If you like political podcasts, you won’t just listen to one, you’ve got a thirst for it.Who’ll be prime minister in a year?Once the Brexit deal is done I think Theresa May will be pushed out.Interview by Gaby HinsliffThe Political PartyMatt Forde’s monthly live show The Political Party has regularly sold out Westminster’s The Other Palace for nearly six years. Each show starts with standup from Forde, followed by an interview with a leading politician. Previous guests have included Tony Blair, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Ruth Davidson. Now a weekly release, the podcast has had more than 1 million downloads on Soundcloud. Forde hosts two special episodes at the Edinburgh festival fringe on 9 and 15 August before returning to London for the show’s monthly residency.How did the podcast start?I wanted to create a comedy night that showcased politicians in an informal, cheeky environment, as an antidote to combative style interviews. It was a way to make politics more exciting, but it’s gone too far the other way now – I’d like it to calm down a bit. There’s a distinction between big personalities and people that are wilfully destructive.How do you feel about the way politics has changed since you started?I’ve become a lot more cynical. It’s a shame that some of the politicians who’ve risen to the top are not the best reflection, not just of the political class, but of British society. We’re uniquely ill-served at a time when we need our very best. Our leaders have been reckless and feckless and cavalier, but the majority of members of parliament are still very good. That’s some hope to cling on to.Best episode so far?The Tessa Jowell one was very special: the effect on the audience in the room was quite profound. She was moved by being allowed to represent the public. It’s a good demonstration of why she was so loved, not just respected.What other podcasts do you like?Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, The Westminster Hour with Carolyn Quinn. And Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson’s Athletico Mince is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard.Do you think your podcast resonates beyond a certain bubble?I do. I get emails from people who wouldn’t ordinarily listen to political stuff, maybe because I’ve always done a lot of football and sporting things. It’s conversational and light and an easy way in, not deep analysis.Who would be your dream guest?Oh, Donald Trump. He’d be weird. Evasive. Probably good fun, sadly. And Hillary Clinton – I think she’s been treated disgracefully.Do you also listen to radio?The Today programme every morning, although I’m not a big fan of John Humphrys.What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit?Oh crikey. A complete fudge. A total mess.Who will be prime minister in a year’s time?Theresa May. I just think there’s plenty of Brexit negotiations left for a successor to not fancy it yet. That said, a lot of my predictions lately have been completely wrong, so...Interview by Kathryn BromwichRemainiacs: The Brexit PodcastRemainiacs (tag line: Ho-hey, let’s stay) is a weekly podcast covering the latest Brexit negotiations, with analysis and lighthearted commentary from presenters Dorian Lynskey, Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith and Ros Taylor. Guests, who are exclusively from the Remain camp, have included Gina Miller, Al Murray, Nick Clegg and Jay Rayner. It attracts 30-40,000 listeners a week.When and why did the podcast begin?Just over a year ago ahead of the general election. We felt there was nowhere that was unashamedly anti-Brexit in the media: the press was largely pro-Brexit and broadcasters are bound by balance rules. So Remainiacs is a safe, fun space for people who believe we should stay in the EU.How did you feel when the Brexit vote was announced?Devastated but not surprised. I’d actually left a permanent, well-paid job to join one of the official Remain campaigns, because I was so worried. I didn’t think we’d be able to undo 40 years of the Murdoch press pouring bile on the EU in a few short weeks of campaigning. The podcast was a way to channel the frustration we had into something positive.What do you love about the podcast format?You can get a depth of analysis from experts you’d ordinarily only get in a well-researched written piece. If you’re commuting, often you can’t read but you can listen to something. I also love that we always try to end on a high note, with something a bit silly, like deciding which TV detective would have voted Leave or Remain.Best episode?Comedian Ahir Shah was absolutely fantastic: he was able to really call Brexit out for what it is in terms of the pain it’s going to cause future generations.Who are your competitors?Reasons to be Cheerful, Ed Miliband’s podcast, is fantastic – it offers a really interesting critique on lots of the issues of the day.Do you think you resonate beyond a certain bubble?I’m not sure we’re trying to – we’re aiming to reach people who voted Remain. So, if we’re honest, no. It’s to give Remainers confidence that Brexit isn’t over yet – there is all to play for still.Dream guest?Justin Trudeau. He’s a great prime minister who has shown a dedication to making Canada a friendly environment for people of different backgrounds, cultures and faiths to go and work.What’s going to happen with Brexit?We’ll stop it!Who will be PM in a year’s time?I’ll take a punt and say Clive Lewis.Interview by Kathryn BromwichTalking PoliticsLaunched after the Brexit vote in 2016 by Cambridge University professor David Runciman, Talking Politics is a weekly podcast that covers international and domestic affairs. Runciman is joined by a regular panel of fellow Cambridge academics and one-off guests such as MP Jess Phillips and economist Thomas Piketty. The podcast has had more than 2.7m downloads to date.Why did you start your podcast?Partly because politics had got super-interesting and I live in a town where people are having conversations about politics all the time. And partly because I’ve spent my life listening to radio and always wanted to do more of it, and a format opened up where you could do it yourself. We got a partnership with the LRB to support it, but we don’t come out of the magazine, nor do we come out of a university. We’re somewhere between the two.Sum up Talking Politics in one sentence.It’s conversations about politics by people who are really interested in it and taken aback by what’s happened in the past couple of years – we’re capturing that sense of “What the hell is going on?”Does it resonate beyond a certain bubble?Our audience includes quite a lot of people at universities, at schools, people who work in government, but we’ve got quite a young audience too. A lot of sixth formers listen to us, and other people quite fresh to politics.What are your favourite episodes?We did one with the American feminist writer Judith Butler just after Trump won, and one with the American historian Jill Lepore just before the inauguration – both really well informed and both reeling in different ways. You always discover things about people when they’re reeling.Who is your dream guest?JK Rowling, because she’s very political. She’s one of the most interesting people on Twitter. She’s really engaged about Scottish independence and Brexit, she’s very forceful and brave – and she’s JK Rowling. For quite a few years now I’ve been teaching the Harry Potter generation and for a lot of them, I think, their first experience of thinking about politics and good and evil was thinking about Voldemort. I can think of students who’ve written really interesting accounts of politics using Harry Potter as a frame, so I have a very clear answer to that question. The problem is access.Who are your competitors?One recent sub-genre is the podcast hosted by a politician or ex-politician – so the Ed Miliband one or the Nick Clegg one – and we’re in a similar space to the magazine podcasts, such as those by the New Statesman and the Economist. But I like to think we’re a bit different to both. I hope people get a sense from the range of panellists that we are never coming at an issue from one point of view – we’re not the anti-Trump podcast or the this-or-that-way-on-Brexit podcast. Also, we talk a lot more about international politics than other British podcasts.How long in advance do you decide what to cover?We think about it over the weekend, my producer and I suggest things we’d like to talk about, but it’s fairly freeform. We never try to decide where it’s going to end up. We record on Wednesday mornings, it goes out Wednesday night, and people pick it up first thing Thursday.What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit?It will happen. I don’t think there will be a second referendum. My feeling is that at some point someone in British politics is going to own it – probably the current government, but possibly the next one – and then I think a whole new set of battle lines will emerge. British politics will really start to turn on the opposition to that deal. But at the moment I think we’re still in the pre-phase where neither party can pull the iding lines together.Who will be prime minister in a year’s time?That’s a hard question, a year is a hell of a long time in politics, but Theresa May is amazingly resilient. Given there have been at least four moments when we were doing the podcast that I didn’t think she’d last beyond the week, I’m going to say Theresa May will be PM in a year’s time – with a big hedge.Interview by Killian FoxPolitical Thinking with Nick\u0026nbspRobinsonSince April 2017, Nick Robinson has been supplementing his Today programme output with a weekly BBC podcast surveying the madhouse that is pre-Brexit British politics. The first batch of episodes of addressed a specific theme, such as “Is the NHS sustainable?”, but since September Robinson has devoted most of his 25-minute-plus running time to grilling a single guest, from politicians to political observers such as James Graham and Armando Iannucci.The longer, more relaxed format plays to his interviewing strengths and he gets a lot out of his subjects, even persuading David Lammy to sing a few lines of his favourite choral piece. The Jess Phillips one is a good place to start, and, if you want an indication of which episode Robinson most enjoyed recording, it’s worth noting that he afforded a full 40 minutes to Jacob Rees-Mogg.Unfiltered with James O’BrienPerhaps as a respite from his LBC talk show, where he is famous for his beleaguered, stream-of-consciousness rants about our national shortcomings and the many absurdities of Brexit, James O’Brien also presents this excellent podcast for Joe, where he lets other people talk at considerable length (usually an hour) with just a few well-timed nudges to keep them on track. You’ll notice that the guests are mostly people O’Brien is predisposed to like: Ronan Farrow, the rapper and activist Akala and – veering away from the purely political – Star Wars actor Mark Hamill. His riveting interview with Bill Browder, aka Vladimir Putin’s public enemy number one, is worth the price of admission alone (though the podcast is free).Anxious and Insecure“Warning: this podcast contains strong language, politics, bad jokes and the opinions of young people,” is how Anxious and Insecure introduces itself at the beginning of each episode, giving fair warning to anyone with a low tolerance for millennial humour. Its hosts Oli Foster (a Londoner) and Arthur Garcia III (from Texas) gamely play up to type – they describe themselves as “the two most millennial millennials ever”, but beneath the joking around there’s some keen political analysis at work. Episodes, which come out at the rate of about three a month, are free-flowing takes on the latest news stories from both sides of the Atlantic. Recently, they’ve tackled Windrush, gun violence and the ill-advised outbursts of Kanye West.Partly Political BroadcastLondon-born standup Tiernan Douieb recently crossed the 100-episode mark with his two-and-a-half-year-old podcast which, he says, “combines politics and comedy together to form politimedy, which isn’t really a thing, but I reckon if we all say it often enough, eventually some idiot will blame it on the EU”. Douieb isn’t coy about his political views – one of the house rules is to find as many condescending ways of describing Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage as possible – and he delivers them in long, rapid-fire monologues interspersed with long, thoughtful interviews with “people who can talk about an issue without toeing a party line, ie campaigners, charity workers…” Politicians aren’t invited.The Skylines PodcastThis weekly podcast from the New Statesman’s CityMetric site may not address politics square-on, but its focus – the intensification and myriad complexities of urban life in the 21st century – raises lots of political questions. Why does Britain have a housing crisis? Why do so many people hate big capital cities? Are there really alligators in the New York sewers? The focus roves far and wide, as host Jonn Elledge and his guests consider the rapid urbanisation of China and look back at city life in Victorian London and ancient Rome. It’s done with a light touch, but over nearly 100 episodes it gets to the heart of what makes a city work (or fail to do so).

On the left, more than 100 women have won congressional contests. Women won three competitive Democratic primaries in Virginia on Tuesday. Women have pulled off upsets in Kentucky, California and Nebraska.On the right, Republicans have flocked to candidates in the mold of Donald Trump. Two incumbent congressmen have lost and four incumbents have failed in statewide contests. This week, Mark Sanford, once governor of South Carolina, now a congressman with strong conservative credentials, lost a primary for being insufficiently supportive of Trump.Such results set up an interesting conflict in November, when a tide of Democratic women will meet a slew of Republican populists.Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist and former White House aide, said: “I think both parties are being forced to reckon with their respective bases.” He did not venture a prediction for what might happen in the midterms.Chris Wilson, a top Republican strategist, noted that in an electorate with increasingly few swing voters, motivating the base is inevitably what matters most.Democratic turnout has been increasing – but so has turnout among Republicans. Wilson used Nevada as an example: more than 142,000 people cast ballots in the Republican gubernatorial primary last week, an increase of 25,000 over 2014.He also pointed out that in key Democratic wins in Republican strongholds, gender was not the deciding factor. Candidates like Doug Jones in Alabama and Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania were able to depict themselves as “a moderate non-threatening candidates”, he said.Stephanie Schriock, head of Emily’s List, a group that tries to elect pro-choice Democratic women, said: “Democratic voters are looking for candidates who are going to fight for them, fight against the Republicans and this administration … and I think they are in a lot of cases looking for fresh faces.Schriock also declined to offer a prediction of what might happen in November. There is, after all, time for trends to change. As Schriock noted, “we’re maybe halfway through the primaries”. Key states like New York, Florida and Michigan have yet to hold contests. What’s more, there have been glaring outliers.In Nevada, Chris Giunchigliani lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to Steve Sisolak, after a campaign featuring active involvement from Emily’s List and a stark television ad in which Giunchigliani talked about her experience of sexual abuse. In Mississippi, appointed Republican senator Cindy Hyde-Smith is running well ahead of Chris McDaniel, an insurgent conservative long popular on the Trumpist right.Nonetheless, the impact of Democratic women and Republican Trumpists is likely to linger past November. No matter which party holds the majority on Capitol Hill, Democrats will be far more heavily female. Even now, there are more then three Democratic women to every Republican woman in Congress.The Republican caucus is increasingly populist, pursuing the policies that propelled Trump to the presidency. In one safe Indiana district, the party has gone so far as to nominate Vice-President Mike Pence’s older brother, Greg. Come January 2019, the bases of both parties will be better represented up on Capitol Hill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a46329a10402b41b353681ab8fd14ac1de9a4b/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f57c394446e8bc40c94f1209faa3d762","title":"angela merkel doubted at home reign ending","story":"For nearly 14 years as Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel has defined and personified Europe’s middle ground: pragmatic, consensual, mercantilist, petit-bourgeois, above all stable. It is little wonder the leader of Mitteleuropa’s major economic power has dominated the political centre for so long.But what if Merkel falls? Can the centre hold? These are increasingly urgent questions as the once unassailable “Mutti” struggles to hold together a fractious coalition. The immediate issue, which is likely to come to a head on Monday, is a furious row over EU immigration policy. But other problems are piling up, with unpredictable consequences for Europe’s future cohesion.Merkel’s political obituary has been written many times, but now the final draft is nearing completion. She is under fire from the hard-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which stormed into the Bundestag last autumn. She has problems with the failing, unpopular Social Democrats on her left, on whom she depends for support.More seriously, though, Merkel is being challenged from within by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, former chairman of Bavaria’s rightwing CSU, which is allied to Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In sum, Seehofer is demanding Germany no longer admit migrants who have first entered the EU via other member states – which is nearly all of them. In Merkel’s view, such a bar would be illegal and would wreck her efforts – ongoing since the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis, when Germany accepted 1 million migrants – to create a balanced, EU-wide policy of voluntary migrant quotas. She says Seehofer should wait for this month’s EU summit to come up with a joint plan.Last week’s row between France and Italy, sparked by Rome’s decision to refuse entry to a ship, the Aquarius, carrying 629 migrants rescued off Libya, showed how improbable is the prospect of agreement at the Brussels summit. Italy’s new populist leadership, in common with an emerging axis of nationalist-minded governments in Austria, Hungary and Poland, believes it has a mandate to halt the migrant flow. Meanwhile, so-called “frontline states” such as Greece, Spain and Italy accuse “destination states” such as Germany, France and the UK of failing to accept a fair share of migrants.Divisions have been exacerbated by the failure, so far, of a key Merkel-backed initiative, the multibillion-euro EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, to reduce migration by addressing “root causes” in places such as Nigeria, Eritrea and Somalia. Reported scandals over the mistreatment of migrants, and inflammatory publicity given to crimes carried out by asylum seekers, stoke the tensions.Merkel’s difficulties extend beyond one rebellious senior minister. In the view of many analysts, she has not re-established her domestic authority since the CDU lost seats in last September’s federal elections and she scrabbled for months to form a coalition. On international issues, Merkel also appears jaded and discouraged, according to close observers.Der Spiegel paints a picture of a leader whose cherished worldview of a rules-based international order has been severely shaken by the apparent impunity enjoyed by authoritarian regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Xi Jinping’s China. The advent of Donald Trump, the “disrupter-in-chief”, and his America First ideology has proved even more damaging than Merkel feared, Der Spiegel said.Maybe that struggle is proving too burdensome. The immediate post-Obama days, when Merkel was hailed as western democracy’s lone saviour, are long gone, too. Trump appears to be conducting a vendetta with Germany over what he sees as unfair export practices and unequal defence spending. Is there a competitive, misogynist tinge to his behaviour? Probably.In any event, Berlin has more to lose than most if promised retaliatory EU tariffs, which Merkel failed to water down, provoke a full-blown trade war with Washington. Meanwhile, Trump’s loud-mouthed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, openly conspires with her conservative rivals.Yet it is Europe, where the Merkel brand has been pre-eminent for so long, which may prove her biggest end-of-career disappointment. Merkel has been outflanked by the reform agenda espoused by Emmanuel Macron. France’s brash new president seeks greater European integration in financial matters, eurozone policy, development and defence. Another, separate bust-up looms over funding the EU’s first post-Brexit budget shortfall.Many in Germany suspect Macron wants Berlin to foot the bill for his grand plan. Smaller EU states are suspicious, too. Popular pressure is for less Brussels, not more – witness the Eurosceptic mood in Italy and Greece. Rather than build a more united Europe, Macron’s ideas could tear it asunder.Merkel’s response has been characteristically cautious. But the sense that she has lost the initiative, and is no longer the leading lady holding things together, is palpable. And, behind her back, Germany’s nationalists and populists skulk like thieves in the night, with knives drawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1a92fe334932a6d71e16b51aa6d35e60b2f5a7/0_254_3810_2286/master/3810.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfe8f52b3c7a7eb5ffbee9e5b66301e7","title":"colombia votes election farc deal petro duque","story":"Key decider in presidential runoff will be who can win votes that went to centrists defeated in first roundColombia goes to the polls on Sunday to choose the country’s first president since a historic peace deal was signed with leftist Farc rebels.From 8am, voters can choose between Iván Duque, a neophyte conservative who opposes the peace deal, and Bogotá’s former mayor Gustavo Petro, once a leftist rebel himself, who defends it.That deal, signed in 2016, formally ended five decades of civil war that killed 220,000 people and displaced 7 million. However, the deal was initially rejected in a referendum, with many taking umbrage at the accord’s promises of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress.Duque’s mentor, hardline former president Alvaro Uribe, led the campaign to upend the deal, though it was later amended and ratified by lawmakers. Many Colombians feel they have been blindsided by the move and on Sunday will have a chance to take their outrage to the ballot box.Colombia has experienced one of the longest internal conflicts in history. It started in the 1960s following a turbulent period known as \u0027la violencia\u0027.\u0026nbspOn the one hand, the Colombian government fought to maintain order and stability, seeking to protect the interests of its citizens and the legitimacy of the state.\u0026nbspOn the other, there were guerilla groups – like Farc and ELN – who said they were fighting for the poor and social justice.And then paramilitary groups emerged, claiming they were reacting to the threats from the guerillas while taking justice into their own hands.More than seven million people were uprooted from their homes and driven to cities fearing for their lives.\u0026nbspAt least two hundred thousand people lost their lives.Numerous human rights violations were committed. Hundreds of people were forcibly recruited and taken far into the Colombian jungle to fight. More than 8,000 cases of child recruitment were recorded.Overall, there have been more than eight million victims, due to the conflict. One out of every five Colombians has been directly affected.After talks lasting more than four years, a peace treaty was signed with Farc in November 2016 effectively bringing the conflict to an end. Key to the agreement are deals on rural development, political participation, illicit drugs and reparations for victims.Farc has given up all of their weapons (verified by the UN) and transitioned into a political party with a voice in the political process.With less money tied up in defence, the country\u0027s spending priorities should now be switching to education, health, infrastructure, the economy and the environment.\u0026nbspBut some are yet to experience \u0027peace\u0027. Scars are deep. Reconciliation, reintegration and access to opportunities take time. President Juan Manuel Santos is due to stand down in 2018 and some election campaigning has stoked concerns over the peace deal.The bruising race has revealed surging polarisation in the Andean nation, with both candidates eliminating moderates in a first round last month, without gaining enough of the vote to win outright. Polls put Duque as the favourite, though a key decider of the election will be which candidate is able to win the votes that went to defeated centrists in the first round.Duque, though market-friendly, talks tough on drugs and crime, while Petro wants to wean Colombia off its dependence on fossil fuels. Both men have accused each other of authoritarian tendencies.Petro has had to defend himself from claims he favours neighbouring Venezuela’s collapsing socialist model. More than a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, stoking fears among many voters that their country could face the same fate. Petro is the first leftist candidate to make it this far in the conservative country.Some worry Duque, a political unknown before being handpicked by Uribe in 2014 to fill a party senate seat, will be his mentor’s puppet if elected. Uribe’s time in office was marked with military successes against the Farc that took huge tolls on civilians. He also weaponised a state intelligence agency to spy on opposition figures.The insults have been thrown from afar, with Duque breaking tradition by refusing to debate with Petro on live television on the eve of the election.Experts worry that the spectre of political violence could return to a fiercely ided country, despite a Farc peace deal that has already been partially implemented. “Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” said Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín. “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0f2a596dc7728134c5a44535d99281d9d714684/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e93195de1a60f0d99185bbcfa692b1b","title":"paris metro male names world without women public vote new stations","story":"To travel on the Paris métro is to take a journey through French – and world – history. Honoured with a station name are war heroes, statesmen, artists and writers including Charles de Gaulle, Markos Botsaris, Franklin D Roosevelt and Victor Hugo.But notable by their absence are women. Only four of the 303 stops on 16 lines are named after female figures, French or otherwise.Now, with two new stations being created on a central line extension, French feminists say it is time to end the snub. The campaign group Osez le féminisme (Dare to be a feminist) is urging people to vote for a woman in an online consultation that offers six possible names – three male and three female – that closes on 17 June.“Did you know that in Paris only four métro stations out of 303 make reference to a woman … You want to change that? So vote!” the organisation writes on its Facebook page.Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu, a spokeswoman, told the Observer: “We have to rename a few more existing stations after women. Most stations make reference to the exploits of what we call in France the Grands Hommes, but we have some great women who also deserve to be recognised. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the métro which is an example of how France continues to ignore the role of women in its history.”Among the proposed new station names are the French singer-songwriter Barbara – born Monique Andrée Serf – who died in 1997 Lucie Aubrac, a member of the French Resistance who died in 2007 and the American singer Nina Simone, who died in 2003.Last month, the Europe stop on line\u0026nbsp3 was renamed Europe-Simone Veil in honour of the health minister and Auschwitz survivor, who died last year. The three other stations named after women are Barbès-Rochechouart, a tribute to Marguerite de Rochechouart de Montpipeau, who was abbess of Montmartre Pierre et Marie Curie, after the Nobel prize-winning physicists, and Louise Michel, a Paris Commune militant.There is a Rosa Parks station on the RER suburban rail network in north Paris, named after the American civil rights activist.Last November, President Emmanuel Macron said his country was “sick with sexism” and declared gender equality and combating violence against women to be a “great cause” of his presidency.In March, following a backlash led by the actor Catherine Deneuve against the #MeToo movement that enraged feminists, the government said it would promote gender equality in education, the workplace and daily life, including fines for sexual harassment in public places.Progress, however, is slow. Last year, for the first time since the modern exam was introduced more than 20 years ago, a book by a woman was among the required works for the literary baccalauréat. La Princesse de Montpensier is a 17th-century court romance by Madame de La Fayette.Françoise Cahen, who teaches at a lycée in a south-eastern suburb of Paris, set up a successful petition calling for the education authorities to address the sexism. Last week, while adjudicating at an oral baccalauréat exam she was shocked to discover that not one of the texts given to 300 pupils to study had been written by a woman.“It was so depressing. Things are slowly but surely getting better, but there’s still some way to go,” Cahen said. “The publishers of school books are making a lot of effort to improve the proportion of women writers and so things are moving forward but gradually.”Osez le féminisme’s Métro campaign has been criticised by those suggesting there are more important issues. Rémy-Leleu admits the station campaign is “symbolic”, but points out that the group is also pushing for lesbian couples and single women to be given the same access to fertility treatment as heterosexual couples. It is also running a protest against a concert tour by Bertrand Cantat, a rock star who was convicted of killing his partner Marie Trintignant in 2003.France has a history of naming roads or railway stations after celebrated figures, even foreigners. Last November, the Burgundy town of Avallon named a street after Jo Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen who was killed during the Brexit campaign in June 2016. But this is the first time métro station names will be chosen by the public. They are due to open in June 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad1d7cd622d0acf49954391ce75adcec0704367/0_79_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55f60f8577074dc57704fa229a63d86","title":"why dutch bring up worlds happiest teenagers","story":"Teens in Netherlands regularly top life satisfaction tables, with schooling playing a big roleIn a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin.The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world.In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. Researchers compiling this year’s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, a four-yearly analysis on 48 countries, say Dutch children’s happiness scores are up again.It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply.So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook?Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says initial findings from the 90-question HBSC survey of a representative 7,000 teenagers, to be published later this year, suggest life satisfaction has risen since 2013.“I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAccording to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents.The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”.Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning.The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”.“If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.”In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.”Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness.Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands.“If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.”Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does.Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.”The Dutch school system – almost entirely public –incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress.There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues.But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement.“Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.”For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy.“It rains a lot. But you get used to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7d28b4bbf0e52b80e9a21abdde5b26911f55ba/85_37_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8975712fe67d2844ec0a1f1823c212","title":"woman swallowed giant python indonesia","story":"Seven-metre snake found during search for woman who had gone to do some gardeningAn Indonesian woman has been found in the belly of a giant python after the swollen snake was captured near where she vanished while tending her vegetable garden, police said on Saturday.The body of 54-year-old Wa Tiba was found on Friday when villagers cut open the seven-metre (23ft) python which was found bloated in the village of Persiapan Lawela on the island of Muna, off Sulawesi.“Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden,” said local police chief Hamka. “The snake’s belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside.”About 100 residents and relatives launched a search for the woman after she failed to return from her garden on Thursday night. Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba’s sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added.Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.While they have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Listowel-born author and historian has had several books publishedProperty owner involved in a number of disputes with tenants at Mountjoy SquarePensioner (73) sustained serious injuries when car he was driving collided with ditchDublin plays host to series of events staged to celebrate James Joyce\u0026rsquos Ulysses on BloomsdaySon of fire victim in hospital with serious burns having come to his aidA file is being prepared for the DPP after suspect was arrested on Friday morningMan (32) killed by a passing vehicle while walking on the N4 near NewtownforbesDrug used to treat up to 100 epileptic seizures a day was confiscated at UK airport\u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore not sure where to go from here, you feel like you have let people down\u0026rsquoLone gunman ran from the scene following attack on Friday nightIncreasingly, the Government will have to ride two horses in the Brexit negotiationsFourteen families face rodent problems and issues with water and electricityConsultants had lodged breach of contract claims against HSE and the StateJury selection meant hearing of evidence essentially reduced to 2\u0026frac12 days"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533572.1529229030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald signals sinn f%C3%A9in s shift to middle ground","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald makes her keynote speech during the Sinn Fein Ard Fheis at Waterfront Hall on Saturday. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesIn her acceptance speech as leader last February, Mary Lou McDonald offered only a glimpse of what her Sinn Féin would offer voters who would, until now, not have considered supporting the party.In the RDS that day, McDonald spoke of a “shared prosperity” - the theme she wanted to guide the party into power in Dublin. The suspicion then was that she would seek to bring Sinn Féin further into the centre of Irish politics, but was not ready to say how she would do so.The ardfheis in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall marked her first major set piece event as leader, and her first half hour long live televised address. Her “shared prosperity”, based on the content of her speech on Saturday evening, is an effort to move the perception of Sinn Féin away from that of a party for the disadvantaged only to one that represents the aspirational lower middle classes and working classes. Those in the party say Gerry Adams made similar arguments, but an Adams leadership was never the vehicle to reach those voters McDonald needs to propel her to Government Buildings. Adams could have said “our agenda is a shared prosperity fuelled by ambition and driven by opportunity”, but would Sinn Féin’s target audience have heard it? McDonald said it, and hopes people were listening. The leaders of any of the aforementioned parties could have comfortably stood over the broad arguments of this speech.The Dublin Central TD spoke of Sinn Féin’s competitors “vying with one another to come up with the best reason to keep us out of government”, and her task between now and the election is to reduce those reasons further. Similar to Micheál Martin, her policy priorities are in the areas of housing, health and rural broadband, but there was no major detail in this speech. Sinn Féin would immediately reopen hospital beds, increase nurses’ pay, build more social homes and introduce rent certainty, but no specifics were offered. On the North, she said Sinn Féin is committed to reestablishing the Stormont institutions, and called on London and Dublin to convene the Intergovernmental Conference, as allowed under the Belfast Agreement. Demands for same-sex marriage and an Irish language act were repeated. But despite saying the “North is next” when it comes to liberalising abortion law, McDonald did not give any indication she is wiling to push Arlene Foster on the matter.If the task of re-entering government in Northern Ireland would not be completed anytime soon, the job of convincing parties in Dublin to share power with Sinn Féin may also be a medium term, rather than immediate, goal.McDonald said she wants to enter a “progressive” coalition and insists she would talk to all comers after the next election. Even if Leo Varadkar or Martin did sit down with McDonald, Sinn Féin figures say their policy demands may not be met by either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. But McDonald is right when she says Sinn Féin and those who vote for them cannot be ignored for much longer. When she said Ireland is a changing place, she means a Sinn Féin in the mainstream of Irish politics is part of that change.McDonald is part of the “new generation” of leaders she spoke about in public life and, under her stewardship, Sinn Féin is changing into a middle ground party."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533543.1529178876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in a party of government mcdonald tells ardfheis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald: “A new and better Ireland is emerging.” Photograph: RTÉSinn Féin is a party of government and wants to be part of a “progressive” administration in Dublin after the next general election, party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said.Those who want to keep the party out of office should “wake up and smell the coffee” and realise Sinn Féin is here to stay, Ms McDonald added.The Dublin Central TD rallied delegates at the Sinn Féin ardfheis in the Waterfront Hall, Belfast: “To those who are on an agenda to exclude us, I invite them to wake up and smell the coffee . . . We are here, we are equal.Sinn Féin, she said, will talk to all parties and Independents after the next election. But its “political competitors vie with one another to come up with the best reason to keep us out of government. Let me set a few things straight. We are already a party of government. We are living through a time of great change. The old certainties are gone. The 2½ party system in the South has been consigned to history. Leadership is shifting to a new generation.”In her keynote leader’s speech, Ms McDonald also said the party’s policy on abortion is now settled. Delegates earlier voted to effectively allow TDs and Senators support legislation to allow for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy when it comes before the Oireachtas.The party is “united in our determination to see the necessary legislation passed without delay”, she said. “And let me say this loud and clear – the North is next.”Ms McDonald was elected party president at a special ardfheis in February. But this event marks her first full ardfheis, including a live televised speech, since succeeding Gerry Adams.In her half-hour address, she expanded on the theme of a “shared prosperity” first mentioned in her acceptance speech upon becoming party leader.“Our agenda is a shared prosperity fuelled by ambition and driven by opportunity. Sinn Féin will deliver for those who struggle to make ends meet, despite getting up and working hard every day.“For those who do everything possible to better their lives, and the lives of their families, yet the wolf remains all too close to the door.“A visit to the doctor, the car breaking down, or back to school costs should not be a financial disaster. No parent should have to pay the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare.“Shared prosperity is also good for business, for enterprise, for innovation and for productivity.”The areas of health, housing and rural broadband were also identified as key policy areas, as well as the building of a “new Ireland”.“Our core objective is the reunification of Ireland, ” added Ms McDonald.On the suspended Stormont Executive, she said: “Let me be clear, a powersharing Executive and Assembly in the North is still the right thing. And we are up for that.”The DUP, she claimed, are in a “fixed, negative space” and are more interested in supporting the Conservative government in Westminster.She repeated that Sinn Féin wants same sex-marriage extended to Northern Ireland and an Irish language act introduced. Abortion reform was not mentioned in the same context, however.She also said the British and Irish governments must convene the Intergovernmental Conference, provided for under the Belfast Agreement, to resolve the impasse. “Unionism cannot and will not hold back the tide of change and equality.”On Brexit, she said the June European Council summit is “crunch time”.“If the British government don’t have a credible acceptable proposal if they cannot demonstrate how they will avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday agreement and citizens’ rights then the Irish Government can call them out.“There can be no question of progressing to the next phase of negotiations in the absence of an answer to the Irish question. This is one test that our Government cannot flunk.”She said there needs to be a “step change in how society views and treats women”.“No half measures of concessions I am talking about full equality. A new Ireland where women are safe, a new Ireland where women are trusted, a new Ireland where women are equally paid.“Ireland is changing. A new and better Ireland is emerging. To those who are impatient for equality and progress, I say, this is your time. This is your home. This is your Ireland. Sinn Féin is your party.”"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

Elizabeth came to the throne in 1558 and reigned for 45 years.The painting has fascinated critics as it shows a rarely seen softer side of Elizabeth\u0026#39s characterExperts restored the painting and after removing layers of paint from earlier attempts they uncovered parts of the original image such as the prayer book in her hand and ermine on her robe.Mr Mould, who presents the BBC\u0027s Fake or Fortune programme, told The : I have yet to conclude, but it appears to be the earliest or possibly only full-length portrait of Elizabeth as Queen.This image is interesting as it belongs to a clutch of images of Elizabeth when she is first Queen. It shows a diminutive quite studious looking girl, noticeably thin holding a prayer book.She is so unlike what we usually associate with a Queen such as Elizabeth, she is earnest and solemn in this portrait. She was a real survivor at this point.Mr Mould discovered the painting and received a huge amount of interest from the art trade and public when he posted a picture of it on his Twitter account.He has now decided to put the portrait on display at his Pall Mall gallery in London from Monday.Mr Mould added: One of the reasons that so few portraits of this period exist is that Elizabeth sought to control her image.She probably disliked images like this as she started to use art to project her power and sovereignty.In her reign Elizabeth designed edicts to control the quality of images of her and she was known to knock into pieces and hurl into the fire images she did not like.She understood the power of art with the same intuitive power that politicians like Boris Johnson, Harold Wilson, and Margaret Thatcher understand the importance of image.Elizabeth understood the importance of her female images with the same intuition that Margaret Thatcher did, as Thatcher understood Elizabeth.The iconic Armada portrait of Queen Elizabeth I being hung in Greenwich last yearThe last Tudor monarch\u0027s reign is seen as a golden age of English history with the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 long held as one of England\u0027s greatest military achievements.Elizabeth, who died in 1603, refused to marry and provide an heir, leaving the throne open for Protestant James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, Elizabeth\u0027s cousin.Please review our commenting policyGlasgow School of Art fire: Fears historic building can\u0026#39t be saved after devastating blazeAnt McPartlin \u0026#39finds love\u0026#39 with personal assistant as wife tweets of heartbreak NHS to get £384m extra a week, as Theresa May locks Britain into leaving EUComment: After his foreign adventures, to win votes Trump must look closer to home Pet rabbits at risk of killer myxomatosis as vets warn hot and humid weather could cause outbreakGosport Hospital doctors should face criminal charges over scores of patient deaths, family sayComment: With train journeys in decline, the public transport dream has derailedWhy migration crisis and bitter personal rift with party rival could cost Angela Merkel her careerComment: Losing one\u0026#39s temper over wanton displays of outrageAquarius ship migrants finally reach land in Spain after week-long odysseyComment: It would be stupid to ignore sliding IQsEU makes bid to salvage migration policy as Europe comes to blowsActor Mary McCormack shares video of British husband\u0026#39s Tesla car going up in flames in trafficSajid Javid reveals his phone was stolen by moped muggersWhite men in the arts living in fear they are too \u0026#39pale, male and stale to succeed\u0026#39, says leading opera singerComment: The British public voted for £350m a week for the NHS.

Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?A glamour model from Essex  who says: I’m definitely more about personality.Londoner Josh, coming to the Island with A-lister stories such as: Anthony Joshua once put me in a headlock for having a terrible haircutBlue-eyed model from Plymouth swapping the catwalk for Love Island.Coming from South Wales, Rosie\u0027s a solicitor: I’m like Legally Blonde… Only Legally Brunette”Student from York: I’m a party animal and I think you really get to know somebody when you go clubbing with them.Recognise the name? Yes, she\u0027s the daughter of Eastenders actor Danny Dyer. From East London, the barmaid says: I am a girly girl. Having a friendship with a girl in the villa is just as important as finding romance.Coming from Newcastle, the personal trainer and gym director says: “I would say I’m a ten out of ten. Maybe a nine out of ten... I’m not good at washing the dishes.”A West End performer from London, Samira says: I’m looking for an experience that I’ve never had before, loads of fun, the opportunity to meet a really nice guy, or even a best friend, and the chance to find myself.A model from Liverpool, Harley says: “My nickname from my friends is a, maybe because I always go after what I want and I always get it.From Staffordshire, the Nuclear Systems Design Engineer says: “I’m looking for a partner, I’m looking for someone I can settle down with and tame my wild lifestyle.”The retail manager and part-time model from Blackpool says: “I don’t do my nails, or have hair or lash extensions. Everything on me is real I am who I am.”An A\u0026ampE Doctor who has already angered the Daily Mail by taking time off his job to appear on the ITV show, Alex comes from Carmarthen, West Wales. He says: I don’t like high maintenance girls. I think it’s brilliant to look good but spending three hours to get ready to go and walk on the beach is too much for me.Another model, this one from London. I have a fun energy and I am a spiritual person, he says. I’d like to think I have a depth to me so I guess that stands out and I look at things quite deeply.The oldest person to join this year\u0027s competition, Laura is a air hostess from Stirling, Scotland. “The emoji that best describes me is probably the blonde girl, she says, because I’m just a weirdo cause I’m always just like, \u0027Hey, soz about me.\u0027A student and construction worker who has a Hermione Granger\u0027s wand tattoo on his arm. Niall says: “My ex would probably say that I’m immature and a bit of an attention seeker - and she wouldn’t be wrong.”Last but not least, we have a Stationary Sales Manager from Kent. “I consider myself really good looking and so far in my life I’ve had no complaints, he says. I get lots of compliments.”She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.The full line up for Love Island 2018 has been announcedWhy we need to stop being snobby about Love IslandLove Island bosses used Tinder to find contestants for the new seriesLove Island bosses are thinking of making an LGBTQ versionAre you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2223 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

I’ve tried so hard to get through to someone at the Home Office, but I got nothing,” he said.“When I got to the UK, I explained to the government why I was here. They know everything about what I’ve done for this country – how I put my life at risk. But they ignored everything. It felt like I was being punished.”Mr Husseinkhel urged that policy should change to help other interpreters who are still “in limbo”. He said: “I have lots of other Afghan interpreters who have put their lives on the line but are still waiting. The Home Office has let down interpreters. They put us in a really horrible situation.“I didn’t leave Afghanistan because I wanted to. I was in danger and was putting my family in danger there. The Ministry of Defence should call on the Home Office to protect interpreters. We’ve done a good job. But the Home Office has let us down.”His comments come\u0026nbspafter a damning report by MPs found that Afghan interpreters who served for the British Army have been “dismally failed” by the UK government, with a scheme designed to offer them protection failing to bring a single one to safety in Britain.Home Secretary Sajid Javid\u0026nbspannounced earlier this month\u0026nbspthat Afghan interpreters who worked with British troops fighting the Taliban would be allowed to stay in the UK for free, but it emerged shortly after\u0026nbspthat the policy only applied\u0026nbspto those who arrived in the UK on a specific five year visa scheme in 2012.Simon Diggins, a retired colonel\u0026nbspwho worked in Afghanistan between 2008 and 2010, said there were around 2,000 interpreters who worked for the army and had been granted no protection. He\u0026nbspcalled for wider changes over\u0026nbspthe protection offered to interpreters.\u0026nbsp“They were vital. It wasn’t just about providing translation services.

Attacks on humans are supposed to be as rare as winning the lottery and being struck by lightning at the same time. Yet last\u0026nbspyear, a man\u0027s body was extracted from a 23-foot-long python, in an incident captured on\u0026nbspa gruesome YouTube video.When Ms\u0026nbspTiba\u0026nbspfailed to return by Friday morning, her sister went to search\u0026nbspfor her alongside around 100 people from\u0026nbspthe village of\u0026nbspPersiapan\u0026nbspLawela.

It was 23 feet long and so bloated it could barely move, with a large bulge midway down its body.The villagers killed the snake and opened it up to find Ms Tiba intact inside the snake, clothed just as she had been when she went to check the corn.Found in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the cobra’s venom can kill a human within 15 minutes and an elephant in three hours.

It was seized by German forces during the First World War and was returned under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, only to be taken back by the Nazis in 1942 and eventually returned to Ghent with the help of the “Monuments Men” (curators and professors who recovered countless artworks stolen by the Nazis).Adolf Hitler was never able to admire the complete work, however, as two of the panels, The Just Judges\u0026nbspand St John the Baptist, had been stolen from the cathedral\u0026nbspin 1934.In the months after the theft\u0026nbspauthorities were sent a series of ransom notes demanding one million Belgian francs in cash.\u0026nbspThe St John the Baptist\u0026nbsppanel was recovered during\u0026nbspnegotiations but the other missing section was never returned.A few months later a 57 year-old money exchange agent, Arsene Goedertier, died of heart failure shortly after revealing that papers relating to the theft were at his home in Wetteren.An envelope containing copies of 13 ransom notes was found in his desk, along with an unsent final letter suggesting that the missing panel “rests in a place where neither I nor anybody else can take it away without arousing the attention of the public”.Conspiracy theories involving the Knights Templars and the Holy Grail have flourished ever since, and several people have claimed to have broken the thief’s secret code.The new theory is based on the scribbled words left on the final note: oiseau, arte, jean, nina, erpe and fourrure, along with the number 152.Mr Marchal said he found locations linked to four of the words that were all 152m from a single point on the Kalandeberg. Plotting the routes also spelt out the letters for the name Nina, he claimed.Further details are outlined in his book The Fourteenth Letter\u0026nbspwith Marc de Bel, who is more famous as the author of the children’s books\u0026nbspThe Egg of Uncle Trotter and Master Plume and the Talking Powder.The masterpiece used as a dartboardMr De Bel described the case as “one of the great art robberies of all time”, and added: “We are waiting for a call from Steven Spielberg now.”“This is of great importance for the city and for Flemish art history,” said the mayor of Ghent.“If this new theory was no more than a stunt to promote a book, I would never have cooperated, and as a city we would not have made our council hall available for a press conference.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, we are currently struggling to see this issue with clarity, and to respond with compassion.“By its very nature, this is an international challenge, with no single, simple solution.“It is therefore imperative that we work together to identify the key trends and to debate and shape an effective policy response.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her dark hair was neatly pinned up and she wore white high heels and carried a small white clutch bag.The pair were warmly greeted by the Spencer family, with Prince Harrys cousin, Louis Spencer, 24, who was recently dubbed Britains most eligible bachelor, giving him a bear hug and kissing Meghan on the cheek.The bride, Celia, arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. Her bridal train was carried by a pretty flower girl and she was accompanied by an array of bridesmaids.She carried a bouquet featuring white roses.Other guests included Princess Dianas brother Earl Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes, who did a reading for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at their wedding.Prince Harrys cousin, Lady Kitty Spencer, 27, who is an aspiring model, was also at the wedding and looked stunning in a floral dress.Prince William and his family did not attend the wedding.The ceremony lasted around 45 minutes and afterwards the wedding guests were invited back to a reception at Celias parents home nearby."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414033599.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british tourist who fell from ibiza apartment block left in critical condition","story":"The mans identity has not been released or details of his nationality but Spanish newspaper Diario de Ibizo says he is British.The incident happened in the early hours of this morning when the victim was found with serious injuries at the Pino Verde apartments in San Antonio.Emergency medics say he has suffered multiple injuries of a serious nature.The Samu 061 team was called out to Ramón and Cajal street in the popular resort at 3.50am.An investigation is already underway but it is suggested that the young man might have from a staircase or stairwell.He was rushed to the clinic of Nuestra Señora del Rosario."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004132975582-e1529084313308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rapport with her majesty gives meghan markle last laugh on critics","story":"Photos of her with the Queen this week showed the two of them getting along like a house on fire.It was clear Her Maj has a lot of time and affection for the newest member of the clan and she went out of her way to make Meghan feel at ease.It was very much a royal masterclass from the Queen to her young apprentice, and Meghan appeared to pass all of the tests with flying colours.It must have been intimidating for the newly minted Duchess to find herself carrying out a royal engagement for the first time with the woman she can now call “granny” without Harry by her side.There was a bit of a faux pas when the Queen had to briskly usher her grand-daughter-in-law into the limo when Meghan appeared to be unsure of ­protocol.The Queen then took her ­preferred seat behind the driver. These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Explore the woods     There\u0027s something very special about spending time under the cover of trees. Perhaps it\u0027s the escape from the heat of the summer sun, or the amazing nature to spot, but woods are great places to spend time in the summer. Aside from just enjoying the greenery and letting your little ones build camps and explore, there are lots of more organised things you can do in the forest. Many offer playgrounds or activities like climbing and zipwires. And lots have cycle-friendly paths for off-road bike trips.

Do, however, make sure you all stay safe and get a good helmet. The Ridge Tornado is just \u0026pound20 at Halfords and kids have amazing options too, from princesses to stars. Once you\u0027ve been out on the trails you\u0027ll want to make sure you get the dirt off your bikes, so make sure you pick up the Bikehut Cleaning Kit from Halfords for \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound10.47). Everything you need for a sparkling bike is included along with a spray lubricant to keep your gears and chain running perfectly.

Workers’ rights group Chinese Labour Watch said thousands of staff were hired as temps who did not qualify for sick or holiday pay and could be laid off in slack periods.

It also claimed many Foxconn staff were on less than half of the average wage. Foxconn told the Sunday Mirror it is revamping its recruitment and admitted at peak periods the number of temporary workers in the factory did “exceed targets and limits”.

We seem to drift into these World Cups, and Euros, and even the Eurovision Song Contest with an iron belief that we should be winning them. People tear up the form book, ignore the statistics and press on in the belief we’ll come out on top... Which brings us to Brexit. However you voted, no one can be under the impression that things are going well. The myth that we can come away from the negotiations with some sort of good deal is up there with \u0026shythinking we’ll get our hands on the World Cup. But listen to some of the hard core and they are already convinced it’s all going to go well. It isn’t. It’s going to be very, very unpleasant.

Sir Christopher Chope prevented a bill making progress in Parliament on Friday, that would have made taking photos up women\u0027s skirts without their consent a specific criminal offence. After Chope and fellow Tory backbencher Philip Davies had ground the House of Commons to a halt by talking for hours about a previous bill on the order paper, MPs had an opportunity to wave the ban through its first stage without a full debate. But Chope shouted object, which stalled the bill\u0027s progress.  Chope has used similar tactics to slow or block progress on a string of bills - including a pardon for Sir Alan Turing, a ban on revenge evictions, the ban on wild animals in circuses and abolishing hospital car parking charges. Presenting a selected list to the Prime Minister in a broadcast interview this morning, the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr asked the Prime Minister: Why did you give him a knighthood six months ago? In fact, Chope was given a knighthood in 2015, for political and public service.

Sir Christopher Chope yesterday triggered uproar after blocking the progress of a bill that would have made taking \u0027upskirt\u0027 photos a specific criminal offence. He was aided by Shipley MP Philip Davies as a raft of other legislation was also blocked. The pair are said to dislike backbench bids to reform the law and challenge them because they see it as their moral crusade. According to Sky News , the pair, on the libertarian Right of the Conservative Party, regard many private members\u0027 bills as politically correct, nanny state nonsense seeking to meddle in people\u0027s lives and curb their personal freedom. The pair have frequently taken advantage of an archaic quirk of Commons rules in which MPs are prevented from voting on a bill on a Friday if the debate goes on past 2.30pm. There is no time limit on members\u0027 speeches on a Friday, effectively allowing them to talk for as long as they want.  Their marathon speeches were during the first debate of the day, on a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Health Units. Tory grandee Chope, 71, the MP for Christchurch in Dorset, shouted down the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill at the second reading stage in the Commons on Friday, prompting derision from his Conservative colleagues and campaigners alike. MPs cried shame as progress of the bill, which has cross-party support and is backed by the Government, was delayed until at July. Other bills that were blocked included a bill to ban buses and coaches from using tyres more than 10 years old a bill to extend Freedom of Information laws to contractors working on public projects and housing associations a bill to abolish hospital car parking charges a bill to ban unpaid workplace trial periods and a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Care Units. Sir Christopher failed to respond to repeated attempts by the Press Association to comment. Theresa May has now moved to soothe anger at the actions of one of her party\u0027s longest-serving MPs.  The Prime Minister, who last month signalled her support for the campaign to ban people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent, pledged the Government would back moves to get the anti-upskirting legislation through Parliament. The PM expressed her disappointment that the private member\u0027s Bill, which would have made upskirting a criminal offence in its own right, was delayed in the Commons. Mrs May said: Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. I am disappointed the Bill didn\u0027t make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through Parliament - with Government support - soon. The Government earlier said it had every expectation upskirting will become illegal, despite Sir Christopher\u0027s actions in opposing a law that would prohibit the craze. Former minister Sir Christopher was heckled with cries of shame! as he deployed his oft-used tactic of opposing backbench private members\u0027 bills by simply shouting an objection moments after the Bill was called.  But Justice Minister, Lucy Frazer said she was confident Sir Christopher\u0027s actions would not scupper the Bill in the long term, although the Ministry of Justice stopped short of setting a time frame on when it would become law. She said: We are committed to making sure upskirting becomes a criminal offence and have every expectation that this will happen. The Voyeurism (Offences) Bill had its second reading on Friday, which, after the Government announced its support following months of legal wrangling with campaigners, would have seen the worst offenders jailed for two years for taking an image under someone\u0027s clothing. Victims said a specific law prohibiting the craze was necessary as current legislation was often insufficient to prosecute an offender. Gina Martin, an upskirting victim whose petition to criminalise the act won her a legion of celebrity supporters and political backing, said the decision left her extremely upset but that she remained positive. David Gauke, the Justice Secretary who collaborated with Ms Martin over her campaign, echoed the dismay within the Conservatives. He said: The Government supported today\u0027s Bill on \u0027up-skirting\u0027. Disappointed that no progress today - the law needs to be reformed. But it will be. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP who introduced the Bill after lobbying Sir Christopher on the back benches in the moments before he delivered the crushing blow, said she was angry, frustrated and disappointed. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was dismayed and appalled at the action, while Tory MP Bob Neill said he has written to the Prime Minister asking that government time be made available to the allow the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill to have its second reading. Moments after blocking the upskirting Bill, Sir Christopher also opposed Finn\u0027s Law, Government-backed plans to give police dogs and horses extra legal protections from attack, and also talked out attempts to reform mental health units. The session caused such outrage it was trending on Twitter in the UK.

The head of the UK\u0027s largest union said the Tories would have risked calling a poll if Ed Miliband, Tony Blair or Gordon Brown were in charge. Speaking at Labour\u0027s music and politics festival the union firebrand also hit out at Labour MPs on the \u0027right wing\u0027. He accused MPs and Labour staff of wanting Corbyn to fail but said they were slapped in the face by millions of people by the general election in 2017. Crowds gathered in the Solidarity Tent to discuss a range of political issues with questions on issues from internal Labour Party politics to the National Health Service and the lack of representation of black and ethnic minority people in politics.   Quoting Shakespeare, Mr McCluskey told the so-called doom and gloomers within the Labour Party: “If you have no stomach in this fight, depart the battlefield.   He told an audience at a People\u0027s Question Time event at Labour Live. If the Labour Party was being run by Ed Miliband or by Gordon Brown or by Tony Blair then we would have had an election by now because the establishment wouldn’t be afraid of what might happen if Labour got into power but they’re scared stiff of Corbyn and that’s why we’ve got to focus on getting him into Number Ten.”    Concerns that the party could be embarrassed by low turn-out at the festival saw ticket prices slashed from \u0026pound35 to \u0026pound10 in recent weeks. But when the Labour leader took to the stage, thousands of supporters filled North London\u0027s White Hart lane recreation ground chanting the now familiar Oh, Jeremy Corbyn to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes.

She voyaged to Ibiza and Cyprus and is off to Spain in September as she celebrates pals becoming brides. Becki has been to 20 weddings since 2016 and the cost is \u0026pound1,600 more than her own will be next year. She and her fianc\u0026eacute Craig Byam spent \u0026pound6,000 on hen and stag do’s, \u0026pound5,000 on accommodation, \u0026pound3,000 on travel, \u0026pound1,000 on gifts, \u0026pound800 on outfits and \u0026pound800 on drinks and extras. But marketing specialist Becki, 26, doesn’t regret a penny of it. She said: “I was shocked when I sat down and did the sums. Nearly \u0026pound17,000.  That’s enough for a new car plus a couple of luxury holidays.  “Some people will think that’s a crazy amount to spend on other \u0026shypeople’s weddings. “Not me – every penny has been well worth it. “I adore my friends and family and would spend whatever it took to share the most important day of their lives with them.”  The spending started in 2016 when Becki attended 12 weddings and seven hen parties. There were three in 2017 but a modest five this year. Becki and Craig, who works in construction, earn average salaries and used most of their spare cash to pay for the celebrations – \u0026shyspending way more than the average \u0026pound266 cost of attending a wedding. She said: “We’re lucky. We don’t have children. We’ve got our house. We both work full time. “We always found the money somehow. With a lot of these things you pay in advance, so our expenses were staggered. “We genuinely had no idea the final tally would be so much.  “The way I look at it is we got lots of fun nights out with the people we love and weekend getaways. “I don’t see why people get \u0026shynegative about the cost of attending weddings. It’s pure fun.” As well as the European trips Becki has visited north, south, east and west in the UK – from Edinburgh to Brighton and Norwich to Liverpool. There have been quaint countryside soirees and ultra-glam urban affairs. Becki went on: “One of the most fun weddings was a destination in Ibiza. It cost almost \u0026pound3,000 but I didn’t mind as we got a fantastic holiday.”  Two of the cheapest weddings cost only \u0026pound60 because they were down the road from where Becki lives with Craig, 31, in Ipswich. Her most expensive UK hen trip was to Brighton in 2016 – setting her back \u0026pound500. That’s the same figure she spent in total on six new dresses for that year’s weddings. And she admitted: “Of course, I like to have a nice outfit. Craig can get away with using the same suit and just mixing things up with a different shirt and tie.  “Now if any of my friends need a dress for a wedding, they head to my closet.” Before 2016, Becki had attended only nine weddings in her lifetime. With more pals tying the knot, Becki’s own big day will be the 33rd wedding ceremony she has attended – after 17 hen do’s. Going to so many has helped her map out her own big day within a \u0026pound15,000 budget.  She said: “We’ve been able to learn a lot from going to so many weddings. The No1 thing we’ve come away with is that money doesn’t \u0026shymatter. “We’ve had a fantastic time as guests. The most important thing is that you are \u0026shysurrounded by people you love. “I don’t think anyone should ever feel pressure to attend a hen do or wedding if they don’t have the cash. “I would understand if someone opted out for that reason. And if you can’t afford a gift, your \u0026shypresence will do just fine.” "},{"url":null,"title":"flesh eating salmonella thailand street","story":"NewsMayo on chips nearly killed young woman on romantic trip to ThailandSian Kempster, 29, from London, recalls how bacteria infected her digestive system and began eating through her intestines after \"boring\" snack on romantic trip\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRuby Deevoy19:48, 16 JUN 2018Updated20:00, 16 JUN 2018NewsSian Kempster went on a romantic Thai holiday with her boyfriend but one simple snack there nearly killed her\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI met my boyfriend Richard on a work night out in 2011 when we were both working as store managers.  He was 24, I was 21 and our relationship got off to a really fabulous start. After a couple of months, we decided to pack in our jobs and travel the world together. Our first destination was Bangkok and, excitedly, we headed out for a bite to eat. All the traditional Thai dishes smelled fantastic and looked wonderfully exotic. But I’d heard horror stories about food poisoning from street food, so I decided to stick to chips and mayonnaise.  Boring, admittedly, but I thought it best to play safe. I felt pretty grim the following morning but put it down to jet lag. Two days later, however, I was bedridden and really suffering. I was pale, sweating and having terrible tummy trouble. It was clear I had food poisoning.  At Richard’s insistence I saw a doctor and was sent away with antibiotics. The next day was my birthday. We had planned a great night out – a fantastic meal, with cocktails and dancing. But it was not to be. I took a turn for the worse and my stomach cramps became unbearable.  I went to the doctor again and was quickly admitted to hospital. It was a terrifying experience – being rushed around, with doctors asking me questions in Thai and broken English. The pain was getting worse by the second. Richard and I held each other, anxiously awaiting results of blood tests and scans. Then, suddenly and without warning, my belly was wiped down by nurses. I was being prepped for surgery – and panicked. Rich called his dad, a doctor in the UK, and he Skyped the Thai surgeon to find out what was going on. It took just a few moments for him to work out that I had contracted a rare strain of salmonella, sometimes found in mayonnaise, which had triggered ulcerative colitis.

A 15-point plan written by wife Angie has guided him since she died in 2010. He has carefully plaited hair, ironed shirts, made sure the kids are in before dark – and vetted boyfriends and girlfriends. Proud Ian is now using the same rules to raise a new generation – his five grandchildren. His loving and caring offspring have done him and Angie proud. And, fittingly, the clan will gather round him today to say a special thank you on Father’s Day.  Former miner Ian, 56, lost childhood sweetheart Angie to cancer. Days before she died at 48, she compiled a list of parenting essentials for Ian and the instructions – shown right – inspired the bestselling book called Mum’s Way. Today Ian and the family will walk along the Yorkshire coast, with Angie in their thoughts. He said: “We’re going to do our annual walk across Thornwick Bay at Flamborough Head, where we’ll pay a visit to Angie’s bench, lay flowers and share memories. “We used to lay in that spot as teenagers looking over the bay, so it’s a perfect way to keep her involved. When we used to do the walk with Angie, she’d cook a medium rare steak back at home, with chips, onion rings, mushrooms and a sliced tomato. “This year I’ll order that from a pub, where I’ll unwrap presents from the kids. My older sons get me Joop or Hugo Boss aftershave as a nod to Angie, as she’d always got me that from them.  “Ella usually gets me chocolates in spite of rule 14 – ‘Don’t give them too many sweets’. She’s found a loophole!” Ian and Angie married in 1985 after falling in love at 14 when they met in the park in Grimethorpe, South Yorks. They had three sons – Ryan, 32, Damon, 29, and Reece, 27 – before Angie was diagnosed with breast cancer at 29. Five years later, after the all-clear, they went on to have five more kids – Connor, 19, twins Jake and Jade, 15, Corey, 12, and Ella, 10. But in 2008, non-smoker Angie developed a persistent cough and doctors found incurable cancer in her lung. It prompted her to write the tear-stained set of rules which Ian swears by. The pointers also cover bedtime rituals, how much screen time the kids get, and a reminder to use sunblock. Now mum’s pearls of wisdom are being passed on to Ian’s grandkids – Ryan’s son Issak, seven, Damon’s two sons Warren, 11, and Cohen, 17 weeks, and Reece’s son Jaxon, three, and daughter Willow, one.  And Ian says he is just as strict with the grandkids. They get just one hour computer time and are indoors before dark to enjoy dinner together. And Ian brings out Angie’s note when necessary to remind his brood about what Mum would have wanted. Another rule – number 16 – was scribbled out and, on reflection, Ian believes it was a reminder from Angie to look after himself. He goes on: “I miss Angie every day but I really did feel her absence during the birth of our grandchildren. She’d have loved hugging them, just as I do.” His hard work enforcing Angie’s list really has seen the kids flourish. Ella was just three when her mum died, but is set to leave primary school with a 100 per cent attendance record. Ian \u0026shyrecalled her first nativity play and said it was particularly difficult.  He said: “As I sat down a \u0026shyteacher said ‘Mr Millthorpe, you are in for a real treat’. Then Ella sang a solo number. I could see the parents turning to look at me. I was almost in tears and I kept looking up wishing Angie could see her too.” Twins Jake and Jade, 15, are studying for their GCSEs, Corey, 12, is doing well at secondary school and Ella, now 10, will join him in September. Connor is learning joinery and plastering at \u0026shycollege. Eldest son Ryan, a warehouse worker, is a few streets away while brickie Damon and window fitter Reece live on the same road as Ian. But the hands-on dad has his own health battles. Having survived a brain haemorrhage in 2004, Ian has chronic lung disease and has trouble breathing after over 20 years as a miner. He said: “The hardest thing I’ve had to deal with is my health. I just want to do right by Angie and my kids. I don’t want to become a burden.”  The children, meanwhile, heap praise on Ian. Jade said: “He’s been so great and supportive. It’s because of him that I want to train as a social worker once I leave school. I want to make a difference to somebody’s life.” "},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet passengers stuck sweltering plane","story":"NewsEasyJet passengers stuck on \u0027sweltering\u0027 plane without air conditioning as woman suffers \u0027panic attack\u0027 during delayThe woman suffering an apparent panic attack rushed to the front of the plane and begged staff to let her off\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlex Wood09:06, 17 JUN 2018Updated09:54, 17 JUN 2018NewsPassengers had to sit on the plane for more than 45 minutes (file photo) (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEasyJet passengers were stuck on a \u0027sweltering\u0027 plane without air conditioning as the temperature soared to 27C outside.

But the new Duchess of Sussex is one in a long line of royals who have set pulses racing. The saucy stills were taken from a video filmed in 2013 by US Men’s Health magazine, which referred to Meghan as “the ultimate guys’ girl”. Footage of the then-actress shows her barbecuing a burger and seductively licking sauce off her thumb as she dis-plays her abs in a crop top. The shoot, filmed while she was starring in US legal drama Suits, was captioned “Grilling Never Looked So Hot”.  Meghan is no stranger to the camera after a decade working in the acting industry, and it resulted in many a sexy shoot to promote her work. But despite being the first Hollywood actress to marry into the British royal family, the new Duchess is not the first member of the firm to show her sexier side when not on duty. Of course, things have got racier over the years. Queen Elizabeth’s sister Princess Margaret first sparked a scandal when in 1959 her birthday portrait showed her bare-shouldered. But as time went on, the idea of a royal not always being clothed from head to toe became more acceptable.  Her daughter Zara is a prime example of rocking a sexy look. Many royals have been photographed on the beach – including Princess Diana in an orange two-piece swimsuit while on holiday in 1999. And Prince Harry, 33, who Meghan, 36, married at Windsor Castle last month, was also snapped topless during a break while serving in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan.  The pictures, taken in 2008, showed him playing rugby with his colleagues during his 10-week tour guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets. And although fully clothed, the Duke of Cambridge, 35, also oozed sex appeal when he was candidly snapped in his air force uniform during a visit to RAF Valley on Anglesey, Wales, seven years ago.  Topless photos of his wife Kate, 36, were published in a French magazine without permission in 2012. Lawyers have since filed an appeal claiming that William and Kate should not have received a \u0026pound92,000 privacy payout. These days mum-of-three Kate looks very demure but often shows off her playful side – as do Prince Andrew’s daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.  Actress Grace Kelly was a sex symbol in 1950s America, appearing in films such as High Society and alongside Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief before she became Princess of Monaco after marrying Prince Rainier III in 1956. Many photos of her posing in swimsuits or risqu\u0026eacute outfits only added to her pin-up status, and after her marriage, no effort was made to ignore her acting past and standing as a sex symbol.

The pair held hands as they walked into church ahead of the ceremony, where bride Celia McCorquodale wore the diamond tiara Princess Diana wore during her wedding to Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were pictured smiling and looking relaxed as they walked along a footpath with other guests. Meghan took a bit of a stumble next to Harry, but he kept a firm grip on her hand. The 36-year-old former actress stunned in a long-sleeved blue-and-white paisley shirt dress and white fascinator at the wedding of Diana\u0027s niece.  Harry, 33, looked sharp in a morning suit, with a royal blue tie to match Meghan\u0027s dress as he watched his cousin wed exactly four weeks after his big day. Meghan\u0027s dark hair was neatly pinned up and she wore white high heels and carried a small white clutch bag. Celia, who is the younger daughter of Diana\u0027s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, looked beautiful in a lace-bodiced dress and a full veil, held in place by the stunning diamond tiara worn by Diana at her wedding to the Prince of Wales in 1981.  Celia, 29, attended Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding exactly a month ago and she returned the favour by inviting the couple to her country wedding to George Woodhouse at St Andrew and St Mary\u0027s Church in the small village of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire. Harry and Meghan looked delighted to be at the occasion as they arrived at the pretty country church holding hands and smiling and laughing with the other guests. The pair were warmly greeted by the Spencer family, with Harry\u0027s cousin, Louis Spencer, 24, who was recently dubbed Britain\u0027s most eligible bachelor, giving him a bear hug and kissing Meghan on the cheek.  The bride arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. Her bridal train was carried by a pretty flower girl and she was accompanied by an array of bridesmaids. She carried a bouquet featuring white roses.  Other guests at Saturday\u0027s nuptials included Diana\u0027s brother Earl Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes, who did a reading for Harry and Meghan at their wedding. Harry\u0027s cousin, Lady Kitty Spencer, 27, who is an aspiring model, was also at the wedding and looked stunning in a floral dress. Prince William and his family did not attend the wedding.  The ceremony lasted around 45 minutes and afterwards the wedding guests were invited back to a reception at Celia\u0027s parents\u0027 home nearby.

People in Cherhill Close, Clifton, put up the impressive display of England flags and now they believe the sight is unrivalled across the country. Chief organiser Ryan Beales decided to decorate the neighbourhood for the first time - and the results are astounding.  He decided to do it ahead of England v Tunisia, which airs on BBC One on Monday at 7pm.   He told the Nottingham Post : When you drive around no one has got any up, it\u0027s done my head in.  Last Euros everyone did it but now it seems everyone\u0027s scared to put a flag up, so we\u0027ve really gone for it. On Friday Ryan, 35, who owns an artificial lawn company, rallied together the whole neighbourhood to help with the close transformation into what could be Nottingham\u0027s number one fan zone.  Everyone was helping, says Forest fan Ryan, They were all getting up ladders and that. We started at 2pm and didn\u0027t finish until 7pm. Ryan, who lives in the close, told the Post of his difficulty in finding the World Cup decorations. I went everywhere and I couldn\u0027t find any, he says. But luckily a trading contact knew where to get some. Ryan also picked up 20 flags from Collins Cash and Carry in Aspley. On Monday, the football fan says he\u0027ll be watching England\u0027s first World Cup match with his family and kids at home - and while he has his fingers crossed Ryan is keeping a sense of humour about the tournament.

Emma Almond, 32, says her daughter Navaeh was swarmed by the parasitic insects on the first night of her family\u0027s weekend break in Southport, Merseyside.  The mum-of-four told the Liverpool Echo she found tiny black bugs on Navaeh\u0027s body and the girl was suffering from painful bites.  But Pontins has hit back, saying the mum brought her own travel cot and bedding, and it disputes the allegation of bed bugs.  Emma, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said her daughter later began vomiting and has been left incredibly distressed over their stay at Pontins. The mum said: They let us know they weren\u0027t checking in until 5pm because the rooms weren\u0027t clean. We got to our room and they were filthy. It was just dirty. It wasn\u0027t until we went to bed that I thought anything of it. I put the bedding on, we woke up the next morning and I went to undress the baby and thought \u0027what\u0027s that?\u0027  There was a little black bug on her skin. I brushed it off her and didn\u0027t think anything of it until my cousin said \u0027she\u0027s got chicken pox overnight\u0027. I said I didn\u0027t know, then she had another bug under her arm. I said they look like bed bugs. I had seen them on Facebook. She added: [Navaeh] was distressed, she was throwing up and everything. She has been really poorly since we got back.  Concerned at the state of her daughter, Emma took her to the nearest pharmacist in Ainsdale, where she claims she was told little Nevaeh had been bitten by some sort of bugs. She said: I went to the pharmacist in Ainsdale and said \u0027what\u0027s this?\u0027 and he said the doctor is right next door and you need to go and book in because they\u0027re bites. I said I\u0027m here on holiday at Pontins and he said you really need to go see a doctor.  He said it was some sort of bite, bed bug, ants, and she had an allergic reaction and that\u0027s why they were so big. I said we\u0027ve not been on the beach yet, we\u0027ve not started the holiday and it was already ruined. He said it must have been in the rooms. They could have been on the floor where she was playing. Emma said she was appalled at the state of the resort, where she stayed with her children and partner Dominic Cullen after arriving on May 28. After Nevaeh\u0027s nasty bites were discovered, Emma complained to staff at Pontins.  She said: I went to them and they said we will move you rooms. We were in 517 then they moved us to 463. That was absolutely immaculate the second one. They had scrubbed everything in that room - you could smell the beds had been sprayed - but obviously I wasn\u0027t happy. She added: I\u0027m absolutely appalled - I\u0027ve only been there three times. My mother-in-law has been there all her life. In a year the place has gone to s***, I can\u0027t believe it.

His family\u0027s rise has seen them go from staring at motors outside a showroom to owning a fleet of luxury wheels, Birmingham Live reports.   Lord Aleem has 576,000 followers on Instagram and 336,574 subscribers on YouTube , and it is through his following that he has managed to help so many people overseas.  Lord Aleem, whose real name is Aleem Iqbal, told the paper: My grandfather worked the in the Royal Mint polishing coins. My father is a self-made man who had everything against him. I am grateful for what I have been blessed with.  It is surreal seeing my own showroom when my father and I used to stare through showroom windows many years ago dreaming of owning just one car inside. Now we own the whole lot and more. I thank God everyday. As for my humanitarian work, there’s a lot more to do. BirminghamLive caught up with the celebrity YouTuber while he was on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, having just completed a second trip to Lebanon to help provide food parcels to Syrian refugees. I have been blessed with so much in life, I feel it is my duty to help those that are less fortunate, he said. It is my responsibility to utilise the following I have to spread awareness on such issues and, if I can inspire even one person to give back, I am on the right track.  Having been to university in London, he\u0027s back in Solihull again now and has no plans to leave the area. Even though our city has it’s ups and downs, I love it and couldn’t imagine myself living anywhere else, he said. This is home. When the presenter roles at Top Gear became vacant, Lord Aleem\u0027s Twitter fans suggested he send in a video featuring a Mercedes-AMG C63, which costs at least \u0026pound60,000. But Aleem laughs about the gossip and says he\u0027s never wanted a job on the car programme, despite having a fleet of supercars himself.  I never applied for Top Gear, I don’t know where people got those facts from, he laughed. I think the current presenters are great and are doing a fantastic job. My life is Top Gear every day. My business is my baby.  My business has allowed me to live every one of my childhood dreams. I couldn’t ask for more. When you\u0027re a millionaire, there\u0027s not much you want for. However, Lord Aleem does say it\u0027s important to pace himself and not get everything in the here and now. I can buy my dream car now if I wanted, he said. But that isn’t my priority right now, after seeing everything I have a lot more work to do before I reward myself with a Bugatti Chiron.

Several fans were disappointed and frustrated to be told the tickets they had bought for the Rolling Stones concert in Cardiff from Viagogo were not actually valid.  James Lye bought two top-tier tickets from the website in February for \u0026pound366 - even though they were originally bought for \u0026pound99.95.  But although he got suspicious when the tickets were sent from Italy, he was looking forward to seeing the band play. Then, on Friday, when he got to the front of the queue, he was horrified to be told the tickets had been cancelled. The 39-year-old said they went to the ticket office, where they were able to buy two more tickets for \u0026pound68 each.  So we still got in, but we spent more than \u0026pound500 on tickets and we were on the top tier, on the back corner, he told Wales Online . I should have done my homework. I was in a rush and bought them from my phone.   Mr Lye, from near Bath, said he emailed Viagogo twice, tweeted and contacted them on Facebook but has had no reply as yet. I feel poorer and pretty gutted, he continued. When we got to the front of the queue, we thought it was sold out so it was quite upsetting. We were a bit disappointed. Mr Lye added: The concert was fantastic and I couldn\u0027t believe how much energy Mick Jagger has got. I wouldn\u0027t have chosen to spend \u0026pound500 on tickets, but still was a brilliant gig. I just don\u0027t want other people to make the same mistake I did. Lowri Jones was another person who said she had problems with the tickets she bought from Viagogo. She said she bought two tickets in March as a present for her sister and her mum, Dot Jones. She said it was a bit of a panic buy as she wanted to get them as a present for her mum\u0027s 70th birthday and paid around \u0026pound315 for both of them. She didn\u0027t even know whether they were sitting or standing tickets.  Initially she was told she would need to print the tickets, she said, but about a week ago they contacted her saying they would be posted to her. They asked for an address and said the tickets would need to be signed for, Ms Jones continued. She said she repeatedly tried to contact them asking when the tickets would be delivered, but they didn\u0027t email her back until Thursday, the day before the concert. She said: It was really frustrating. On Thursday at 4.30pm somebody rang me to say I had not given them an address. I said that I had.  I asked whether it would be better for us to pick them up in Cardiff and they said they would send me an email saying where and when to pick them up. They said 3pm in the Marriott hotel. They [her mum and her sister] went to get their tickets to be told there were no tickets there and that they would refund them the money. It was a real disaster. The 39-year-old said she then contacted Viagogo, who apologised to her as no tickets were available. She has been told she will get a refund and a voucher but she said she won\u0027t be using the company again.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Rebecca Carey, nine, and her twin sister Lottie have become stars of this year’s Marks \u0026amp Spencer catalogue back-to-school range. And Rebecca also dances in a new BBC Super Movers campaign to encourage children to become more active. Her proud mum Pam, 48, says: “After everything we have been through, to see Rebecca doing all this is just incredible. “We couldn’t be happier. We’ll never be able to thank everyone who helped her enough.”  Two years ago, we revealed how Rebecca yearned to walk just like twin Lottie. But she was denied surgery on the NHS that could help her get out of her wheelchair.  So the sisters wrote to then Prime Minister David Cameron to ask why she could not be treated for her stage-four cerebral palsy .  “Why won’t you let me walk and play with my twin sister? It makes me sad. In my dreams I can walk and play,” she told the PM. And Lottie added: “Can you tell me why you won’t pay for my sister to have an operation to help her walk?” But the NHS couldn’t help, so her mum and dad Tim, 50, began raising funds themselves for life-changing surgery in America. Generous Sunday Mirror readers dug deep, helping to raise tens of thousands of pounds towards the \u0026pound84,000 selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery in Missouri. Stoke City player Peter Crouch also hosted an event for the young fan, netting \u0026pound26,000 for the fund.  After the op to destroy problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord, which hamper people with such conditions, Rebecca had intense physiotherapy – finally building enough strength to use her walking aid on her own.  By December last year she could sit unaided , use her left arm and could even speak more easily.  “At Christmas she was able to walk to the tree to pick up her presents,” says Pam, of Congleton, Cheshire. Then came stardom. M\u0026ampS – whose local branch had supported \u0026shyRebecca’s fundraising – asked if she and Lottie could model for the 2018 uniform range. They were photographed in April, and now also proudly feature on the M\u0026ampS website.  “It was a lovely thing for M\u0026ampS to do. When Rebecca saw her picture online she was quite bemused,” says Pam. “It is quite ironic that we are working incredibly hard to encourage Rebecca to walk independently but she is photographed in her wheelchair. “She has come on in leaps and bounds.” Ryan Becker, head of kidswear marketing at M\u0026ampS said: “We had a great time shooting our Back to School campaign with 30 brilliant kids and both Rebecca and Lottie were a pleasure to work with. “This year the theme of our adverts both online and in-store is “life isn’t uniform” so it was \u0026shyespecially important to have a diverse range of models wearing our clothes.”  The BBC also offered Rebecca a starring role in their new campaign to get kids active, run in partnership with the Premier League. Dan Gooding, executive producer at BBC Learning, says: “It was important to us to show that Super Movers, an initiative to get children moving more at school and at home, is accessible and enjoyable for everyone – regardless of age, background or ability. “Rebecca showed us she is an \u0026shyabsolute star and a real champion of the Super Movers spirit”. The youngster continues to go from strength to strength thanks to her op. “From always having to be by an adult’s side since the day she was born, she is now revelling in her new found \u0026shyindependence – and being able to play with her sister.

Temperatures are expected to soar to 30C in parts of the UK on Tuesday amid a mini-heatwave. June is on track to be Britain’s hottest for 42 years, when stifling heat led to standpipes on streets as drought hit. Forecasters say a lot of fine and dry weather is set to come this summer, with this month warmer and drier than average.    This month’s average temperature of 14.7 - from June 1-14 - is 1.7C above normal. That makes it the warmest June since 1976 when it was 15C over the whole of June, Met Office figures show.

Highs pushing close to 30C were forecast by ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending. Temperatures are poised to pip the 29.1C hottest day of the year, set on April 19 at St James’s Park, London. Until then, Sunday will remain cool and breezy across much of the UK with temperatures lingering in the high teens or low twenties.  There will be rain or drizzle in some places with occasional clear spells. Monday will be a vast improvement with temperatures hitting about 25C in South East England and 22C in the South West, where it will be rather breezy with some rain possible. Temperatures will be in the low twenties through the Midlands and parts of Wales, and in the high teens across northern England and Northern Ireland.

Wa Tiba\u0027s children became concerned when she failed to return to her home in Southeast Sulawesi Thursday, June 14. A search party was launched the next morning in a desperate bid to find the 54-year-old - and her sandals, machete and torch were later found 30 metres from a patch of bushes. Nothing could have prepared Wa Tiba\u0027s sons for what happened next. The pair discovered an enormous python on the ground, barely able to move due to an enormous bulge in its belly after it had swallowed the housewife head first.  Resident Ayu Kartika said: Everybody was crying, everybody was shocked. The poor woman. This is like a horror movie. People are terrified. We are scared to go outside. We can only pray for a safety. The frantic lads called police and by 9am hundreds of villagers had gathered round the patch of grass in the remote Mabolu Village in the Lohia Regency of Muna province.  Nightmarish footage captured the moment the snake\u0027s skin was sliced open to reveal the slime-covered corpse of the housewife. She was still wearing her brown leggings and dark red top.  While the knife that Wa Tiba had gone out with the previous evening was found on the floor - suggesting she had dropped it after being struck with deadly power by the killer python. Her head was towards the snake\u0027s tail and her feet at its mouth - showing that she had been swallowed head first.  Police superintendent Agung Ramos from the Muna district Indonesian National Police said Wa Tiba had went out to check her garden the previous evening and never returned. He said: Children and residents had been looking for Wa after she did not return home. Some items belonging to victim, sandals, machete, and flashlights, were found but the victim was not there. The family then reported this to the police and the search reached its conclusion at 9am. Residents found a python that looked like it was unable to move. Residents then suspected the snake swallowed Wa Tiba.  People took the snake into the village and started splitting the snake. The suspicions were true and there was a body in tact inside the snake. Unfortunately the victim was lifeless. Wa Tiba had a traditional burial ceremony later that afternoon in keeping with traditional religious customs.  Sulawesi is an island in Indonesia that is home to some of the biggest and most deadly wild pythons in the world. In March last year, a young farmer was found dead having also been swallowed by an enormous killer snake.  Footage showed him being cut from the python\u0027s stomach after going missing the night before while harvesting on a rubber plantation.

We’ve got one retiring at Baldragon and we’ve filled that.“You’d think that they (Labour) would know that, considering that elected members sit on the panel to determine head teachers. It’s fair to say the position is getting better compared to a few years ago.“The posts that are unfilled at the moment will be filled. It’s not a case where we’ll just not replace anyone.“We’ve got applicants and candidates for every position. That’s not to say that they are all necessarily the right candidates and we still have to go through the interview process along with all the correct checks to prove that they are suitable.”Mr Malone believes vacant posts are having an adverse impact on closing the attainment gap in Dundee and called on the administration to “up its game” or risk “complete failure”.He added: “If we are to meet targets for enhancing the learning experience and closing the attainment gap, then we need to ensure our schools have the resources necessary for every child to get the educational opportunities they deserve.“Also, that our teachers can receive the support necessary to continue their efforts to deliver high-quality teaching without any undue stress due to staffing shortages.“Tighter financial controls would have allowed the council to free up money to deliver an incentive to attract the subject teachers.“The administration rejected Labour’s proposals at budget time that would have delivered a golden hello to the subject teachers we need to attract.“More financial control by the administration could have delivered so much more and resolved the problem we currently have in attracting teachers.”But Councillor Murray said Labour’s alternative was unviable, adding: “Other councils have done that but that’s not the route I want to go down.“It doesn’t work. It becomes an arms race where one authority can offer more than the other.“It doesn’t create any more staff and it’s just a waste of public money.“I’ve only been in the position for 12 months and it’s definitely been a lot easier this year finding staff.“I think a lot of it is down to there being more confidence in the city.“We’re doing a lot of work with Dundee University for people who can’t afford to quit their jobs to apply for teaching vacancies in city schools and that’s been positive.“There’s certainly no shortage of people applying.“We’ve been inundated particularly with people wanting to become head teachers, which is a good thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee va could host weddings as approval given to sell booze","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe V\u0026ampA Dundee museum could host events as varied as weddings and casino nights, its operators have revealed.The details emerged during a meeting of the council’s licensing board, during which the gallery made its case to sell booze for consumption both on and off the premises.The museum’s operation plan, distributed ahead of the meeting, revealed V\u0026ampA bosses hope to stage live music, dance performances, film screenings, private events and casino nights.Janet Hood, representing the V\u0026ampA at the board meeting, said this could even stretch to include weddings.She said: “As I am sure you are all aware, there is a cafe in the foyer.

the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side

McKinnon is just in the door at Cappielow and is busy bringing in players.His aim is the play-offs – Jim Duffy was sacked for not making them – so pressure is on.Queen of the SouthThe Doonhamers haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are set to be in place by July next year.Sunday 17 Jun 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111983.jpg","title":"New school campus is given the green light","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to create a badly-needed new school campus in a growing Inverness neighbourhood have been given the green light to the delight of community leaders.Highland councillors approved proposals to transform the existing Merkinch Primary School and nursery into a facility fit for the 21st century including all-weather sports pitches which will be available to the local community.It will also incorporate the Merkinch Family Centre which will relocate from its base in Coronation Park.The school is presently housed in cramped accommodation in a 132-year-old category B-listed building with extensions plus portable classrooms in the playground.Under the plans, which are broadly supported by the community, a new two-storey extension in a contemporary design will be built to accommodate the primary school and nursery.There will also be an adjoining single-storey double height sports block, play areas, informal/social courtyard spaces and garden areas.The relocated family centre, school dining hall and community sports studios will be housed in the original school building which will be refurbished while previous extensions will be demolished.Inverness Central councillor Richard Laird outlined the challenges of the development site when he spoke at the council\u0027s south planning applications committee meeting on Tuesday.\"To describe this as simply expanding a new school understates what the council is seeking to do,\" he said.The SNP representative said the integrated campus would provide services from the very early years right through primary school.Cllr Laird felt the designs addressed a range of existing issues including the grassed playing area which he described as an \"unusable bog\" at certain times of the year plus road safety concerns over traffic on Telford Road where the present school entrance is located.He also felt the location of the proposed two-storey extension in the centre of the site presented no risk of overshadowing Carse Road.\"I think what we have is a very elegant solution to a number of challenges,\" he said.\"This is a project which has almost unanimous support in the Merkinch community.\"Speaking after the meeting, fellow ward councillor Bet McAllister was \"over the moon\" the plans had been given the go ahead.\"It will make a huge difference to the community,\" the Labour representative said.\"It is a lovely school. Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be

beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1f62abe061e-436x564.jpg ","title":"a bit of hollywood comes to north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic

accessible for the first time in its history.”Dame Anne, who was the first permanent wheelchair user of the House of Commons since 1880, said there was an “imaginative solution” to providing wheelchair access through the Music Hall’s front door.She added: “I am particularly looking forward to sitting in the balcony for the first time and experiencing the Music Hall’s famous acoustic at its best.“This is an exciting time for the Music Hall – Aberdeen Performing Arts has risen to the challenge of turning a 200-year-old-building into one fit for the 21st Century and making it

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"harbour gallery open entry call from tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 01/06/18, 5:48 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSunday June 3, sees the Stuart Herd Harbour Gallery Open take place at Glenralloch with an entry fee of £15.The club is hopeful that the recent good weather will encourage a healthy turnout of competitors for this popular event.There are four nett prizes and four scratch prizes on offer with the winner receiving one of Stuart\u0026#8217s stunning prints of a scene from Tarbert golf course.To book your entry please call the club at 01880 820565.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

Mhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester. The pair now live in Ayr. “We met on a training course in Livingston in 2010 - Chris offered me his last jelly baby!” said Mhari. “It was after Chris moved from Livingston to Ayr that we started dating properly and have been together since.” The couple tied the knot on Sunday, April 1 at The Waterside Hotel in West Kilbride. Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Steam returns to the Borders Railway","story":"STEAM

after it was confirmed this week that the Post Office is returning to the town.\nAt the meeting of the town\u0026rsquos community council on Monday evening, chairman Marshall Douglas revealed that the owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here in Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoSusan has confirmed that the new Post Office concession will be opening on Wednesday, August 29, at 1pm.\nThe delivery of the news brings an end to a long-running saga to reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road. Mr Dickie said \u0026ldquoother retailers were interested in that site and they were looking to progress plans \u0026ldquorelatively quickly."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7919368.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Call for community to invest in Humbie wind farm","story":"              A COMMUNITY energy project is urging investors to back a project which will operate 12 wind turbines near Humbie and help tackle fuel poverty.  The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6904683.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Top journalist launches quirky    111 Places in Glasgow You Shouldn   t Miss    discovery guide","story":"              SEASONED journalist Tom Shields has launched a quirky discovery guide for those looking to explore Glasgow\u0026rsquos hidden gems.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP-supporting tycoon Brian Souter criticises wealthy for being  narcissistic  and  self-obsessed ","story":"              HE is one of the country\u0026rsquos most successful businessmen and his family is estimated to be worth nearly \u0026pound1billion.  But Sir Brian Souter, who has also ploughed in part of his fortune to the SNP, has taken aim at his fellow millionaires.  At a prayer breakfast earlier this month, the transport tycoon said the most \u0026ldquonarcissistic and \u0026ldquoself-obsessed people he had met were rich.  He added that wealthy people are in need of \u0026ldquotransformation in their lives just as much as heroin addicts.  Souter and his sister Ann Gloag made their money by founding Scottish-based bus company Stagecoach, which also owns coach operator Megabus and South West Trains.  Stagecoach serves around 2.5 million passengers a day and the transport giant also operates in North America. Souter and Gloag were said to be worth \u0026pound920 million, although it was reported last year that the siblings had split their wealth in order to follow \"different investment strategies\".  Souter is also known for his charitable giving via his family trust, which has awarded more than \u0026pound32 million over the last three years.  An evangelical Christian who is linked to the Church of the Nazarene, the tycoon\u0026rsquos charity is interested in projects that relieve human suffering and promote spiritual welfare.  Souter recently fronted an event in Edinburgh at which he promoted the theory of \u0026ldquotransformation, which in Christianity focuses on changing individual lives.  He interviewed a former heroin addict, Alfie McCracken, who told of how he used to be homeless and had considered taking his own life.  In conversation with Souter, McCracken said his life changed after he visited a church in Largs and was \u0026ldquosmothered in love. He said he found Jesus and stopped using drugs.  Souter then made a speech in which he said \u0026ldquorules and \u0026ldquorole models are not enough to transform lives, a process that also requires a \u0026ldquoredeemer.  He claimed McCracken had found his redeemer: \u0026ldquoWhen he [Alfie] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, transformation happened in his life. When a supernatural power, greater than his own, was able to deliver him from the addiction of heroin.  However, he added that other individuals did not feel their own lives required the same change: \u0026ldquoI meet a lot of wealthy people in my walk of life, and let me tell you, they need transformation just as much as Alfie.  Souter added: \u0026ldquoThe most narcissistic, self-obsessed people I have met have had a lot of money, and I don\u0026rsquot find that amongst the homeless. The truth is we all need transformation.  The tycoon\u0027s political donations have attracted more attention than his charitable giving. Souter has donated over \u0026pound2m to the SNP and pro-independence causes, including sizeable pre-election donations.  He also spent over \u0026pound1 million in 2000 bankrolling a private referendum opposing Government plans to repeal anti-gay rights legislation. His high-profile campaign was widely criticised by MSPs, who believed he was hijacking democracy in a bid to keep a discriminatory law.  Christian Wolmer, who wrote a book in the 1990s which charted the rise of Stagecoach, said of Souter\u0026rsquos remarks:  \u0026ldquoI am glad that Brian is prepared to be critical of some of his fellow millionaires but it is a mistake to think that only religion offers solutions. If the rich paid taxes commensurate with their income and their wealth, then there would be sufficient money in the public services to ensure that there would be fewer people like Alfie who find themselves in bad situations.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe rich need to develop a social conscience, recognise the problem of inequality and be prepared to put back into society what they have gained from it. To be fair, I do recognise that Brian does that."},{"url":null,"title":"How did we determine the weather pre-digital age ","story":"              THERE\u0027S a storm coming. I can feel it in my throbbing temples and in the oppressive, muggy heat that\u0027s been building all day. I also know from this morning\u0027s radio forecast that thundery showers are expected by nightfall but having just read a book that claims humans don\u0027t need professional meteorologists to predict the weather, I have switched off all my gadgets and determined to study the world around me for clues as to when the storm will break.  This, after all, is what our ancestors did. \u0026ldquoIn the past, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective, \u0026ldquoit was vital that everyone could recognise and interpret these signs. People were dependent on nature and intimately familiar with it.  So highly attuned were they to nature\u0027s sights, scents and sounds that in the centuries before barometers, clocks and digital calendars, humans used those signals not only to predict the weather but to establish the time of day and season of the year.  These days, most of the UK population is urban and even here in Scotland, where 98 per cent of the landmass is rural, only 20 per cent of us live in the countryside. But if we think our ancient bond with the natural world no longer matters we are dangerously deluded, argues Wohlleben, a German forester whose last book, The Hidden Life Of Trees, was an international bestseller. \u0026ldquoIn the face of climate change and damage to the environment, he argues, \u0026ldquoit is more urgent than ever that we recognise and understand the signs of nature. Only then will we appreciate what we stand to lose.  With those ominous words ringing in my ears, I step out through my front door and prepare to tune in to those elemental messages, but instead find myself negotiating a sensory assault course of traffic noise, reeking dustbins and ugly building sites.  Once inside the fecund haven of my nearest park, however, I sit on the grass and look heavenwards as our great, great, great grandparents would routinely have done before deciding whether this was a good day to sow their oats or bring in the sheep, cast their nets or batten down the hatches. Their existential dread of spoiled harvests and shipwreck was written into folklore and Met Office research conducted last summer suggests 75 per cent of us still set store by those old proverbs, particularly the one about a red sky at night foretelling shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) delight, which 70 per cent of us believe. And apparently we are not far wrong, since that nocturnal rosy glow is caused by the high pressure associated with good weather. \u0026ldquoHigh pressure traps dust and dirt in the air, which scatters blue light, only leaving the red remaining \u0026ndash hence the reddish appearance of the sky, explains the Met Office website.  A red sky in the morning, meanwhile, actually does act as a reliable shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) warning since, as Wohlleben explains, \u0026ldquothe sun rises in the east, where the sky is clear, and shines onto the clouds gathering in the west, which will rapidly spread and fill the sky.  Useful as it may be, that old adage is no help to me now in the middle of a sultry afternoon so I decide to examine the clouds themselves, which people seem always to have known were linked to weather even if they didn\u0027t understand the scientific reasons. In Greek mythology, clouds were nymphs who gathered river water in cloudy pitchers before ascending to the sky where they floated around in billowing robes, emptying the contents over the earth. Ancient Hindu tradition construed clouds as heavenly white elephants, which used their trunks to shower rainwater over the land below. And for the Native American Navajo people, clouds were formed by the flapping wings of a great white swan.  As we now know, of course, the more prosaic explanation is that low pressure causes water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. Thinner cloud lets more light through and so appears white. \u0026ldquoIf you see tall, towering clouds on the horizon, it means rain (or snow) is likely soon, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf they seem to puff out at the top, or form an anvil shape (where the cloud tower is being pulled apart at the top), then a thunderstorm is on the way.  Right now, there is no discernable shape to the cloud, which is lightish grey but so widely dispersed across the sky that although I can hear the drone of an aircraft overhead, I can\u0027t see it and nor can I tell whether it has left one of those lingering condensation trails which Wohlleben says act as \u0026ldquoearly harbingers, of bad weather since if they don\u0027t dissolve, \u0026ldquothat means humidity is on its way, and with it a low-pressure area. The sky will soon cloud over.  Clearly, we have passed that milepost so I lower my gaze and look around for earthly omens. With no cattle around, I can\u0027t test the old trope about cows lying down before a cloudburst (which is nonsense anyway, according to the Met Office, even if 61 per cent of us believe in it), so I look for botanical soothsayers in the form of daisies. \u0026ldquoOne glance at the white and yellow flowers is enough to tell if you should hang your laundry out, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf rain is on the way, or a storm, the petals close up. Some also droop downwards, to avoid letting a single drop in.  Evidently, the daisies in this Glasgow park are rebellious little flowers, for despite the fact that the sky has darkened and I can actually hear the rumble of distant thunder, their petals are defiantly open. So I search instead for some dandelions, having heard that the seeding heads shut up like umbrellas when bad weather is approaching. And Eureka! I find a clump of elderly dandelions with one fully formed clock and three of those feathery heads, all tightly furled like little green and white brollies.  And now I close my eyes and listen for the sound of silence. We all know calm is supposed to precede a storm, and it\u0027s generally thought that birds go quiet beforehand. And if evidence for this is hard to come by, they are known to be extremely sensitive to small changes in atmospheric pressure and to time their migratory flights accordingly. A 2014 study by the University of California found that golden-winged warblers took a substantial detour from their usual migration route to avoid ferocious tornadoes which killed 35 people.  Our feathered friends feature prominently in weather lore. \u0026ldquoHawks flying high means a clear sky, runs the old rhyme. \u0026ldquoWhen they fly low, prepare for a blow. Seabirds flying inland and solo-flying crows are also supposed to presage foul weather, while birds singing in the rain reputedly do so before a change for the better.  More pertinently for today\u0027s purposes, low-flying swallows are meant to warn us that storms are approaching but Wohlleben casts doubt on this theory, arguing that \u0026ldquoif anything, it\u0027s the other way around: as the wind picks up before a storm, swallows are likely to fly higher than usual. The saying \u0027when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry\u0027 could well lead you astray.  He says chaffinches are better barometers, apparently modifying their song when the weather is set to turn. When the sun is shining, he writes,\u0026ldquothe males usually trill a melody that sounds a little like \u0027chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo\u0027. If storm clouds loom or rain falls, however, he switches to a monosyllabic \u0027raaatch\u0027.  Sadly, I couldn\u0027t tell a chaffinch\u0027s cry from a sparrow\u0027s, which is probably symptomatic of how detached I am from the natural signals with which my great-great-great-etc-grandmother would have been intimately familiar. The Weather Detective contains fascinating, if depressing, insights into the way our urban lifestyles are shattering our ties with nature \u0026ndash not least through light pollution, which is obliterating the nocturnal star-shows that once guided our ancestors\u0027 footsteps. Meanwhile, moths, which mistake artificial lights for the moon by which they orientate their flight paths, find themselves hopelessly circumnavigating those electrical orbs until they die of exhaustion. (Bats, apparently, have learned to profit from their confusion, by patrolling street lights on warm summer nights, where they feast on disorientated moths.)  Here in the park, it\u0027s still broad daylight and in fact, the clouds have lightened to a greyish white. The thunder appears to have passed overhead and only a few splashes of rain have fallen. Perhaps those daisies were better informed than the dandelions after all. And indeed even my troubled bones \u0026ndash or rather, the headache that\u0027s been nagging since morning \u0026ndash has miraculously cleared with the storm clouds.  For as Wohlleben confirms, your granny is not necessarily havering about the rheumatic twinges or other physical symptoms that supposedly presage a change in the weather, since humans \u0026ndash like other animals \u0026ndash are hardwired to detect the shifts in air pressure that determine meteorological variations. Why some people are more sensitive than others to their inbuilt barometer is unclear, though Wohlleben surmises that it could be linked to changes in the conductivity of our cell membranes, which can become more sensitive as a result of certain medical conditions.  Whatever the cause, in the days before central heating and ready-meals, paying attention to those physiological indicators, and to their surroundings, would have been second nature to our ancestors.  Today, we are increasingly alienated from the natural world. In 2005, American author Richard Louv coined the term \u0026ldquonature deficit disorder to describe the harm we are doing to our children by robbing them of the opportunity to run, play and climb trees in the great outdoors. Even the language of childhood is changing. In 2015, prominent authors such as Margaret Atwood and Michael Morpurgo expressed \u0026ldquoprofound alarm at the Oxford University Press\u0027s decision to drop words such as \u0026ldquobuttercup and \u0026ldquominnows from its children\u0027s dictionaries, in favour of terms such as \u0026ldquobroadband and \u0026ldquocut-and-paste.  So does Wohlleben want us to throw away our smartphones? Apparently not. \u0026ldquoI\u0027m not advocating a return to our roots or a rejection of modern life, he insists. \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0027m really interested in is reclaiming our sensitivity to nature and reawakening our powers of observation. When we use our senses at full capacity, we access the wealth of thrilling and calming experiences waiting for us just outside our back doors, in nature and in our gardens. He urges us to train our sense of hearing, by attending to nature\u0027s noises. \u0026ldquoFind out what your own favourite garden sound is: perhaps it\u0027s the song of a blackbird at dusk, the rustle of a hedgehog under a hedge or the brisk buzz of a bumblebee in the shrubs. There are so many amazing things to hear out there beyond the everyday tumult of cars and planes.  Here in this city park, the rumble of cars and planes remains audible through the trees but so does the chirrup of birds (which may or may not be chaffinches) and the rustle of something that just might be a hedgehog.  The storm clouds, meanwhile, have all but disappeared. And I\u0027m sure I can smell sunshine.  The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature\u0027s Signs by Peter Wohlleben is published by Rider, \u0026pound12.99  PREDICTING THE SEASONS  Does a bumper summer crop of nuts, berries and fruits mean a hard winter is coming? Not necessarily. \u0026ldquoSadly, we can\u0027t predict the future from a bountiful crop, writes Peter Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoAfter all, the fruit buds are produced the previous summer. If it indicates anything, an abundance of acorns and beechnuts in the forests suggests \u0026hellip a dry summer the previous year.  Can snowmen sense the coming of spring? Astonishingly, yes \u0026hellip though only in the sense that if you can manage to build one, it means the snow itself is of the right consistency to be rolled into balls. And since this happens when temperatures are comparatively mild, it could mean that a long, hard spell is coming to an end.  Do pine cones act as weather stations? Sort of. \u0026ldquoThey open up in sunny, dry weather making a big puffy cone, while in rainy weather they close up making the cone smaller and narrower, explains Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoHowever, since the change lags behind the weather \u0026hellip they are completely useless as a forecasting instrument.  HOW TO TELL THE TIME BY NATURE\u0027S CLOCK  You can set your watch by flowers, many of which open at different times of day. \u0026ldquoPumpkins and courgettes kick things off first by opening their flowers at 5 o\u0027clock in the morning, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective. \u0026ldquoFrom 8am the marigolds spread out their petals and the daisies follow at 9.  Meanwhile, birdsong can help tell us the early morning time but only if your ears are attuned to the melodies of particular birds, since the various species vary their peak dawn chorus moment, in order to ensure their territorial and mating calls aren\u0027t drowned out by others.  On the RSPB\u0027s website, Jenny Shelton offers this evocative chronology of the UK\u0027s dawn chorus, which she says peaks in the half-hour before and after sunrise: \u0026ldquoRobins, blackbirds and song thrushes begin, then the wrens and warblers join in. Finally, come the chaffinches, goldfinches and sparrows. It\u0027s thought that, because this last group have smaller eyes, they need more light to find food.  WHY DOES MIDSUMMER\u0027S DAY FALL AT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER?  On Midsummer\u0027s Day, June 21, the sun is at its peak in the sky. \u0026ldquoThe reason why summer only truly begins after this peak, writes Peter Wohlleben, \u0026ldquois that the sun needs several weeks to heat up the air. This means the temperature increase lags a little behind the sun\u0027s height in the sky, and the air temperature only reaches its maximum later in the season when the days are already getting shorter again."},{"url":null,"title":"Alex Salmond says he urged Ian Blackford to adopt more disruptive tactics ahead of SNP Commons walkout","story":"              ALEX Salmond says he was behind the SNP\u0027s dramatic mass walkout at Westminster.  SNP MPs stormed out of the Commons chamber earlier this week when Ian Blackford was kicked out by the speaker during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions amid protests that MPs had not been given enough time to consider over 50 amendments to the Brexit bill on devolution.  Salmond said he suggested the dramatic protest during a chat with Blackford, the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader.  The former First Minister said Blackford phoned him on the eve of the clash.  \u0026ldquoOne of the iron laws of parliamentary politics is that if you always play the Westminster game then you will always lose,\" Salmond told the Sunday Herald.  \"And the way to turn that round successfully is to target interventions at those occasions which mean so much to the Westminster establishment - PMQs, budgets, state openings etc, and then use their own procedures against them.  \"Certainly that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through.\"  Salmond said he was filming in Gibraltar for a TV programme about Brexit when Blackford sought his advice about taking on the Tories.  Writing in today\u0027s Sunday Herald, Blackford blasted the \"absolute scandal\" of what he said was a lack of debate on a \"power grab\".  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means completely demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas.  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  Blackford said MPs had been given just 15 minutes to debate the measures in the EU Withdrawal Bill, and warned that the stand off was a \"defining moment when the UK Parliament chose to reject devolution\".  Blackford is to use a debate in Westminster tomorrow (Monday) to make the case for emergency legislation to halt the \"power grab\".  Salmond was famously thrown out of the Commons chamber in 1988 after he interrupted the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, in mid-flow.  In a dramatic move, Salmond \u0026ndash who had been an MP for just a year \u0026ndash spoke out against the controversial poll tax, a flagship policy of the Thatcher government.  After barracking Lawson and becoming the first MP in history to break parliamentary convention by intervening during the Chancellor\u0026rsquos budget, Salmond was ordered to leave the Commons.  In a frank admission, Salmond said that some SNP MPs between 2015 and 2017 had been \"intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence\".  He suggested that the SNP\u0027s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 general election was partly due to it becoming too comfortable with the Westminster set up.  Salmond, who was one of the SNP\u0027s casualties last year, said the walkout was a return to a much more effective style of opposition by the party.  \"The challenge for the SNP is to keep up the momentum. Westminster is treating Scotland with contempt,\" he said.  \"Now they are receiving a taste of their own medicine.  \"If they want business as usual then they should get their mitts off the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  \"In my opinion the SNP fell into the Westminster trap after 2015 and then paid the price at the polls.  \"Too many of the current crop of MPs then seemed intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence. Now all that has changed and well done to them.  \"The people who send the SNP south expect their MPs to shake it up, not settle down.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The UK Government is proceeding entirely in line with devolution. Rather than manufacture grievance the SNP should be working with us to get best deal for people in Scotland as we leave the EU.  Scottish Tory MP John Lamont added: \u0026ldquoThis really demonstrates the utter immaturity of the SNP.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Angela Haggerty  Stop letting kids think they  39 re stupid if they don  39 t go to university","story":"              THE value of university education was back in the news earlier this week after a group of young Shetlanders told the Education and Skills Committee that they wanted a broader range of options other than continuing in academia available to them when leaving school.

Earlier this month, a poll of 900 young people found that two thirds felt they were given far more information about going to university than any other opportunities when discussing their futures, and some pupils raised concerns that their schools were more minded to boost their institutional reputations rather than taking a more sincere look at the most suitable career path for individuals.

Many of my fellow pupils dropped out of school after sitting their standard grade exams, and it was always met with a sense of disdain, or failure. At a barely conscious level, us kids knew that leaving at that point was seen as a sign of lower intellect, of less ability. The real success was in going to university, and that was a marker of the kids who would inevitably go on to greater things in life.  Kids pick up on these signals and have no frame of reference for them. It\u0026rsquos only in adulthood that any of us would have stopped to reassess those ideas. But as kids, it was accepted, barely even consciously, that there was a dividing line between those who would go on to university and those who wouldn\u0026rsquot.  It\u0026rsquos only now that I wonder about the full psychological impact that had. I didn\u0026rsquot leave after my standard grades, I left the year after, following a dismal performance in my Higher exams. I am now the news editor of a national newspaper, and yet I only scraped a C in Higher English. And that was the only Higher I got.  The reason is that I was going through quite a tough time. I didn\u0026rsquot come from riches or financial comfort. Life where I came from was hard, and the pressures I was facing as a teenager made it impossible to thrive in education.  I took it all very personally. With little real understanding of the magnitude of the challenges I was facing as a teenager, I leapt to the conclusion that perhaps I was just stupid. University and education just wasn\u0026rsquot for the likes of me. I had no concept of the fact that my academic performance as a struggling teenager was not an indicator of my ability or my intelligence.  As far as I understood it, the smart kids went to university, and if I wasn\u0026rsquot going there then I probably had a bleak future ahead.  It took me until my mid-20s to realise that wasn\u0026rsquot true. My career in journalism began by accident when I started volunteering at a local community radio station. Stumbling upon this route gave me an unexpected career, and it turned out I didn\u0026rsquot need a university education to pursue it.  It will be a welcome development if MSPs can facilitate a real change of attitudes on university education. Young people are probably right when they point out that maintaining good university entrance rates is a big factor for schools concerned about reputation, and so there should be more incentives to include apprenticeship, work experience programmes and the entering the workplace directly from school as positive performance metrics.  Going to university is a great thing, but it\u0026rsquos not for everybody. We need to make sure kids are valued for the skills they have, not punished by our attitudes because they excel in areas other than academia.  TORY UPSTART  The internet erupted on Friday after a Conservative MP, Sir Christopher Chope, blocked the passage of a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence in England.  For those who don\u0026rsquot know, upskirting is the practice of taking a photograph up a woman\u0026rsquos skirt. It seems farcical, like it belongs in the same realms as strange men who steal underwear from washing lines. However, neither of those behaviours are remotely normal, funny or mischievous. Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who indulges in either of those things and it takes about half a second to realise how disturbing it actually is.  The good news in Scotland is that upskirting is already a crime here. Hopefully England and Wales will follow suit soon."},{"url":null,"title":"Digital currency Scotcoin holders to be given bonus if they transfer to new version of coin","story":"              HOLDERS of the digital currency Scotcoin will be given a bonus of four times their stake if they transfer, or \"migrate\", to a new version of the coin.  The Scotcoin owners are building a new blockchain, the engine which drives cryptocurrencies. The present one handles the buying and selling of coins, as a kind of digital bureau de change, with the information on transactions shared between thousands of computers throughout the world making it, in theory, uncrackable.  \"But it\u0027s creaking and it\u0027s expensive,\" says Scotcoin co-owner David Low, \"so our new one will be cheaper, faster and more reliable.\" It will be, he adds, \"the rock \u0027n\u0027 roll version\".  To encourage the present 4,000 holders of the currency (including Sunday Herald readers who took up a free offer 18 months ago) to migrate to the new coin they will be offered four new ones for each one they hold. \"We value each present coin at one pence, a hundred is a pound and so you\u0027ll get five pounds for your pound if you take up the offer.\"  That offer is likely to last six months but Low can\u0027t say when it will start \u0026ndash that will depend on when the new blockchain is finished, and he isn\u0027t putting a time on that. But he is confident that holders will make the switch. \"Why keep an old Russian bearer bond,\" is how he puts it, \"when you can have a dollar?\"  Another advantage of the new system is that people will be able to switch directly to and from the main established currencies, like sterling, the euro and the dollar. And it will take the volatility out of crypto-trading because scotcoin will be linked to the pound and not bitcoin, which has been highly volatile. So its value will rise or fall with sterling.  Low has also offered scotcoin\u0027s IP address to the Scottish Government which, if taken up, would make it the country\u0027s official digital currency. He described initial meetings about it as \"highly encouraging\".  As he told the Sunday Herald in the past: \u0026ldquoHere\u0027s me, a guy who makes money out of the system and I basically latched onto the currency issue, the single biggest thing which lost the referendum. An independent Scotland must have its own currency, for better or worse.\"  Low may seem an unlikely rebel against financial orthodoxy but the accountant and financial adviser has a starry track record. It was him who organised, on the ground, the shareholder uprising which removed the seemingly impregnable families who owned Celtic and ushered in Fergus McCann, the jaggy bunneted Scottish ex-pat from Canada, who transformed the football club.  When the new scotcoin is launched, Low and his partner Temple Melville will hold a stake worth, notionally, around \u0026pound950 million. But he doesn\u0027t intend to profit from it, all of it will go into what he calls a common wealth fund. \"It will be the polar opposite of a sovereign wealth fund because it will benefit the poor and the disadvantaged.\" Administered by a group of \"the great and the good\", the plan is to pay young people in scotcoin to do good works for the benefit of the community.  It\u0027s a kind of quantitive easing in reverse, contrary to the present system where \"the rich get richer and poorer get poorer, the poorer will get richer\". If under-25s are given, say, pounds1000 or pounds10,000 \"they can do with it what they want, save it or spend it and if they spend it then it benefits the economy\".  To spend it they need outlets, and not just the Arlington Bar, which Low owns. \"I\u0027m confident that the big companies will get involved so that the kid will be able to walk into Greggs or M\u0026ampS or any large retailer and buy what he or she wants using a card, just like now. It\u0027s coming.

After the shock in May 2014, fears about the continued existence of the building subsided and it appeared that, by some miracle, it was salvageable. Rather than devastation, the tale was shaping up take its place in history is a miraculous escape. It would take more than that to break a building which held such passion and history within its walls.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to articulate the richness of that history, and its importance to Glasgow. The Mackintosh building cements the place of Charles Rennie Mackintosh into the fabric of the city. It sits among the buzz of the bustle, both soaking up the Glasgow culture and helping define it.  The building has occupied its place in the Glasgow landscape since 1899, when the first half of the project was completed. It was designed by Rennie Mackintosh, then a junior draughtsman at firm Honeyman and Keppie, which submitted the plans as part of an architectural competition.  The school itself, as an institution, was founded more than 50 years before, and had already gained a substantial reputation in the field. Before it settled in its new home in Renfrew Street, in the glory of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos design, it had enjoyed stints in the Merchant City\u0026rsquos Ingram Street and the McLellan Galleries.  The prestigious institution went on to hold a number of academic schools: the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation, and the Innovation School.  While maintaining its reputation as a revered place of study and continuing to appeal to international students as well as local, the School of Art, and in particular the Mackintosh building, has been popular with tourists as a place of historical and cultural significance.  Its relevance to modern art as well as history is undisputed. The School has been host to numerous winners and nominees of the Turner Prize in recent times, such as Richard Wright, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce.  Indeed, it boasts a strong roster of alumni. As well as its most famous son, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art has also counted artist Peter Howson, Travis singer Fran Healy, author Alasdair Gray, former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, former Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and broadcaster Muriel Gray among its students.  While Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated in the modern age and he has secured his place in the history of art and architecture, he wasn\u0026rsquot always appreciated in his time. Despite his unexpected success with the Art School design, he struggled to get other major commissions in his time. The Glasgow School of Art is the most emphatic physical expression of his contribution to cultural history, and the building therefore represents something bigger for Scotland than just as a hub of rich art and cultural nurturing.  For the city of Glasgow, it hurts. Locals have dealt with several tragedies in recent years. While there is relief at the lack of any casualties as a result of the fire, the same could not be said for the disasters in 2013, when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha Bar, and at Christmas 2014, when a number of people were killed in the bin lorry tragedy in the centre of town.  The first fire at the School of Art almost became a ray of light after the initial shock and sadness had calmed. For once it seemed the city may have caught a small break when it became clear that the School could be saved and restored. Now, the double blow feels like a knockout punch to the gut for a city looking forward to a grand re-opening of the Mackintosh building next year. And if it hadn\u0026rsquot already seemed like the planets had for some reason aligned to seal the famous building\u0026rsquos fate, the added salt in the wound is that the second fire happened on the School\u0026rsquos graduation day.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things to consider when thinking, when writing, about events since Friday night is accepting that we now may be discussing the Mackintosh building as something that once existed. It is not the chapter of history anyone could have imagined. It feels cruel and unfair. It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine it as something that was, but that no longer is. Glasgow will, of course, recover, and the School\u0026rsquos admirable reputation will continue. For now, however, the city needs a moment to mourn. Then, the questions, and anger, will inevitably come."},{"url":null,"title":"Beaumont sets British record on penny farthing","story":"              ENDURANCE cyclist Mark Beaumont has set a British record for the furthest distance travelled on a penny farthing in an hour.

She knew better than to get excited \u0026ndash it was simply a detailed drawing of his foot so she could tailor him the perfect sock. Ever the logician, this selfish gesture made perfect sense to Albert. He had feet and a wife who could sew. Socks or mc2, both are simply conclusions to cold calculations.  Perhaps Einstein had simply outgrown his brain\u0026rsquos empathetic static, that hunger for emotional reciprocation gifted to us by evolution to maintain social order. Despite his saintly posthumous persona, there is clear evidence that paints the young Einstein as a chap whose much-vaunted \u0026ldquohumanity was actually a wildly prejudiced, dispassionate study in societal anthropology.  Certainly, a dark disdain for his fellow man has been revealed in private diaries which finally went on public view this week.  Penned in the 20s, these jottings mainly detail the physicist\u0026rsquos tour of Asia and his highly questionable attitudes towards folk he observed on his travels. In particular, the Chinese. A great bunch of lads, according to Father Ted. Einstein disagreed. Like Ted, he preferred to group individuals as a collective and branded the entire Chinese population \u0026ndash 400 million at the time \u0026ndash \u0026ldquopeculiar, herd-like \u0026hellip often more like automatons than people. And, typical of Einstein, he was thinking of the future when he signed off with the zinger: \u0026ldquoIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. The Bernard Manning of physics had spoken.  A spectacular level of conceit is also evident in a lame yet rather lyrical piece of \u0026ldquoothering which conveyed Einstein\u0026rsquos distaste for Chinese women. Unlike his foot sketch this critique was, assumedly, an attempt at humour \u0026ndash yet its laboured structure suggests a sentence squeezed out by the bowels of the mind as some sort of dirty protest against decency. Einstein wrote: \u0026ldquo... how little difference there is between (the) men and women. I don\u0026rsquot understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring. A simple \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot fancy yours much would have done, Albert. He certainly wouldn\u0026rsquot have been a fan of xhamster.  The irony of having expressed such abhorrent views on racial superiority was likely not lost on Einstein when he was forced to flee Germany 10 years later. Dehumanising Nazi propaganda, echoing his own musings on Chinese inferiority, had stoked anti-semitic fervour to fever pitch in his homeland. Einstein was forced to face himself in the mirror and see the real-world consequences of casual stereotypes and generalisations when used as weapons by politicians.  And as his star rose and influence grew in America, a newfound devotion towards civil rights and race relations made it clear that this great teacher of the universe\u0026rsquos secrets had learned a powerful lesson of his own in humility.  THE FUTURE IS IN CHINA\u0027S HANDS  IT\u0026rsquoS especially ironic that the most forward-thinking of modern physicists chose China as his target for blinkered offloading of the id. Shame on the young Einstein if he was already aware that no civilisation on Earth has enjoyed a longer continuous tradition of astronomy and science than the Chinese.  Around 1500BC, China\u0026rsquos stargazers inprinted detailed depictions of complex cosmic events on to shells and bones \u0026ndash with one of these fascinating relics being the earliest known record of a solar eclipse.  The Chinese are far from done with their 4,000-year quest to unlock the secrets of the universe. In fact, they\u0026rsquore just getting started \u0026ndash having recently spent billions to build the Jehovah\u0026rsquos dinner plate of satellites \u0026ndash Earth\u0026rsquos largest-ever communication structure. It was created with the single objective of discovering signals from alien civilisations.  A government splurging so much of its new-found wealth on alien hunting may seem a frivolous waste of cash, especially one with appalling levels of socio-economic hardship, but a newly-revived China views such expenditure as an investment in the future.  Above all their myriad Earthly geopolitical ambitions, what China truly desires is \u0026ldquofirst contact. Keen to solidify their superpower status in the eyes of the world, they\u0026rsquore too late to put the first man in space (Russia) or on the moon (Kubrick. Kidding, USA) so they have turned their focus on something even more seismic and culturally significant.  Of course, the Chinese also want extra-terrestrials to view them as Earth\u0026rsquos dominant nation \u0026ndash but whether aliens will recognise lines on maps as a viable way to draw distinctions between this lukewarm rock\u0026rsquos self-destructive, territorial hate machines is another matter.  Chinese ambitions don\u0026rsquot end at discovering extraterrestrial civilisations either \u0026ndash there are advanced plans for building an observatory on the dark side of the moon within the next few decades. They also quite fancy trumping the Americans by colonising Mars first too. Make no mistake, putting that first human foot on the red planet is presently the superpowers\u0026rsquo most highly contested prize, one desired beyond all other Earthly concerns.  Admirably, China has also raised a salutary two fingers towards the strain of xenophobic isolationism favoured by young Einstein, with plans to link up their alien-hunting satellite with countless other SETI projects across the planet. A vision of one big united skin condition itching Earth\u0026rsquos crust together to explore the great unknown \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a beautiful thing.  In fact, it\u0026rsquos the kind of progressive \u0026ldquostrength in numbers societal partnership that might one day save us all from being skinned alive by interstellar big game hunters from Zeta Reticuli that China inadvertently alert to our presence.  HARDWIRED FOR PREJUDICE  THE more hysterical media reports covering Einstein\u0026rsquos racist indiscretions were predictably light on the physicist\u0026rsquos attempts to confront the issue of civil rights in his adopted home of America \u0026ndash a lifelong crusade perhaps born of a desire to make amends for his rather prejudiced views as a younger man.  Yet, it\u0026rsquos not so easy to brush off Einstein\u0026rsquos mindset as simply a naive reflection of the prevailing attitudes of the era. Racism isn\u0026rsquot quite so clear-cut \u0026ndash one day, the dissonant turbulence left in the wake of a Trump presidency, Brexit and rise of the far-right across the globe will likely rank high among humanity\u0026rsquos most dangerously xenophobic eras \u0026ndash depressingly arriving just half a century after the Jewish holocaust.  Although humanity toils under the illusion of forward progress, human cultural norms and societal attitudes \u0026ndash as Einstein discovered with light \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot always travel in a straight line.  Our perceptions of reality swim in a continual state of flux, adapting by expanding and contracting to fit the sociological, cultural and economical climate of the era. Evolution has evidently built our brains to be vulnerable to societal herdthink, and we only have to open our eyes to see our willingness to fall in line with hive mentality.  Prejudice certainly sharpens the hazy chaos of internal dialogue to a sharp point, giving the meaninglessness meaning and reinforcing the heady delusion of racial superiority. Reciprocated antipathy releases a highly addictive brain chemical cocktail of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.  Territorialism is seriously addictive \u0026ndash quite likely a hardwired evolutionary hangover. Yet ironically, many individuals only feel that they truly exist when becoming anonymous in the echo chamber \u0026ndash with the hive validating their infected mindset.  Einstein\u0026rsquos own addiction to the rush of personal prejudice was clearly still evident during the twilight of his career, having mutated from blinkered racism to a stubborn refusal to accept new scientific ideas \u0026ndash most famously his denial of the reality of quantum physics.  It led to wasted decades of dead-end research, with Einstein himself acknowledging the relative uneventfulness of his post-fame career.  A fruitless search to find a unifying theory to marry the world of the very small with Newtonian physics once again showed that even genius is not invulner-able to that opiate of the human condition \u0026ndash the rose-tinted comfort of our own long-calcified mindsets.  As Einstein himself said: \u0026ldquoBrief is this existence, a fleeting visit in a strange house. The path to be pursued is poorly lit by a flickering consciousness."},{"url":null,"title":"Plans to increase weeks off work for paternity leave would help 17 000 families in Scotland","story":"              Around 17,000 families in Scotland would benefit from an increase in paternity pay and leave, according to Labour.

I listened to their concerns and I undertook to consider their concerns. And the next day I stood up in Prime Minister\u0027s Questions and said I\u0027d put an amendment down in the House of Lords. I\u0027ve done exactly that.  Facing claims of betrayal by some pro-EU colleagues, Mrs May insisted that she and her Cabinet colleagues recognised the concerns some people had about the role of Parliament in the Brexit process but she made clear she would not budge on the primacy of Government in the talks with Brussels, saying: \"Parliament cannot tie the hands of Government in negotiations.\"  However, her Tory colleagues Dominic Grieve made it clear the Conservative rebels did not intend to back down on getting Parliament more say on Brexit.

And I can assure you I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders. The difficulty is that the Brexit process is inherently risky.\"  Robert Buckland, the Solicitor General, insisted UK ministers intended to press on with their own meaningful vote amendment, which suggested a Government motion on the final deal could not be amended rebels believe this means the meaningful vote would, therefore, not be meaningful.  Mr Buckland stressed that while Tory rebels argued the vote they wanted would only be advisory, he stressed that even this vote could have a political consequence and send a signal to Brussels that the UK Government was not in control of its own negotiating strategy. \u0026ldquoThere is a political contest to all of this, he insisted.  Ahead of the Lords debate tomorrow, Lord Newby, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the upper chamber, accused Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans on the Brexit bill as \u0026ldquobreathtaking in their arrogance and deceit.  \u0026ldquoHaving reneged on a promise made to her own colleagues, it is clear she cannot be trusted.

This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

The issue was raised with Mr Clark by a constituent at a recent surgery, Alfred Middleton from Inverurie, who is a shareholder in RBS.                                                    The claimants secured a £200million settlement from RBS last summer.        However, solicitors for the claimants have not yet received all the money from RBS and only about £25million has been paid to investors so far. A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.
