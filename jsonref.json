Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But I’ll never forgive the price-gougers exploiting the pandemicHeroes and villains of the business world are quite boring: Richard Branson is always the villain James Timpson is always the hero. We didn’t need a crisis to learn this any fool could have said it a decade ago. Timpson has been rehabilitating prisoners, fixing them up with employment upon release, actually setting up training workshops in some jails, for years. And Branson has been the man he is, also for years.Corner shops, however, are less clear cut: I am fascinated by the raw emotion they ignite, and am obsessed with whether or not I will maintain my fierce new loyalties and hatreds once lockdown is lifted, or forget them within a week.So, there was an everything-and-nothing shop I always felt guilty about, after a small supermarket opened and just sold more, better, cheaper stuff. But since lockdown, they have turned out to be price gougers. Full fiver-for-hand-sanitiser, loo-roll-out-the-back-for-roughly-the-price-of-drugs bad guys, the kind of people who would swap you a jar of jam for an emerald broach in the middle of a siege. About three weeks in, they stopped serving people at all, and would only serve Deliveroo drivers, through a hatch fags for £25 and whisky for the kind of price that even someone in the grip of delirium tremens should think twice about.“Are you for real,” I asked, trying to score some Carlsberg through the hatch, “after all the Haribo and Monster Munch I’ve detoured here for, to keep morale up?” “Yes, darling,” they said, deploying this empty endearment as if their hands were tied by the gods of health and safety.But then there is an establishment with a surprising but very niche butchery counter and a hardware section out the back, known to us as the testicles-and-fuses shop.

It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether’s it’s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one’s funeral, the toll has been significant. It’s no surprise then, that news the prime minister’s chief adviser travelled from London to Durham with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government – such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis – extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions – including testing and tracing, and isolation – to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless.Second, Cummings’s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street’s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house near, but separate to, his family, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age.Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions.Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives.Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates 9,000 daily new cases in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they’re supposed to serve.The summer months must be used to think ahead, since the winter poses additional challenges. How can a second lockdown be avoided? How can more deaths be prevented? The clear lessons from east Asia are a robust test, trace and isolate system, close monitoring of hotspots such as care homes and hospitals, the protection of health and social care workers, border control and working towards a “new normal” involving face masks, temperature checks and distancing.Every single person in the world is now affected by this outbreak. How exactly they are affected has more to do with their government’s handling of the virus than anything else. Successful responses have not been correlated with country wealth, but rather with decisive political will and a clear strategy. Just compare the situations in the United States and Brazil with South Korea, Kerala in India, Greece, Vietnam and Senegal. Everything – whether it is schools reopening, the shielding of the elderly and vulnerable iniduals, the viability of businesses, and families being able to see each other – depends on the ability of a government to contain this virus aggressively and quickly. Those of us who live in the UK need this government to succeed, but that requires it to focus all its efforts on public health planning, clear communication and retaining public trust – something made harder when a senior adviser appears to flout the rules.• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d564a321a3ba077e090744678c77ef0ee26fc168/109_223_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f62dd233f3940cbe862e25736b84ba","title":"dominic cummings elitism","story":"The prime minister’s self-centred endorsement of his overmighty adviser is an outrageous snub to the rest of usThe shadow of death still hangs over the country. The losses from the Covid-19 virus continue to mount. The end is not yet in sight. The way we live will be altered by the pandemic and its consequences for years to come. Amid the weight and seriousness of life-changing and life-ending events, how can the national conversation be dominated for three days by the bad behaviour of Dominic Cummings during the lockdown?The answer is brutal but clear. It is because Cummings has so much power and has done so much to make this country what it is today, first because of Brexit, and now because of the mishandling of the pandemic. The furore over his rule-breaking cannot be dismissed as a bubble issue, especially after Boris Johnson backed him so comprehensively and isively from the No 10 lectern today. Now, whether Cummings ultimately goes or stays, this is a choice that affects everyone and everything.The poison in Cummings’s journey to Durham is the taint of hypocrisy it injects into the public bloodstream at precisely the time when public confidence in the handling of the crisis is already beginning to fray. One rule for him, another for us. It’s an absolutely lethal tag for any government project, but it’s doubly, triply so in a pandemic. The arrogance and ineptitude are staggering.The Johnson government’s initial lockdown message, which Cummings was intimately involved in formulating and promoting, could hardly have been simpler. Stay at home, it said. That simple injunction was reinforced by exceptionally direct messaging and public advertising. Johnson, speaking to the nation on TV, called it an “instruction”. The ubiquitous ads said things like: “If one person breaks the rules, we will all suffer,” and: “Breaking the rules is breaking the law.”The public got the message. To the evident surprise of some of the government’s advisers, they took it seriously and overwhelmingly obeyed. Every day, ministers and scientists confirmed the public’s discipline about sticking to the rules. The nation’s sacrifices, some of them heartbreaking, were repeatedly extolled. What aspect of that message would Cummings himself not have understood when his wife, Mary Wakefield, told him that she was suffering from Covid-19 symptoms herself?It is utterly clear what Cummings should have done as he considered his wife’s disturbing news and the implications for himself and their four-year-old son. He should have considered his options. He should then have warned the prime minister and the cabinet secretary about potential problems. He should have consulted with them very specifically about how to act. And he should have taken their advice on whether it was appropriate to travel to self-isolate. As a political animal, and someone who would know that he could be spotted and photographed, he should have been alert. He could have proposed that a proactive press release could have been issued to cover his back.Whether Cummings consulted anyone in that way is not clear. Nor is their response, if there was one. Perhaps he didn’t bother to ask. Perhaps, with Johnson himself sickening with Covid-19 at the same time, no one was senior enough or brave enough to stand up to Cummings and say: “Stay in London.” If that was the case, it says a lot about the workings of this government, none of it good. We are entitled to know what happened, and who knew, because the public policy implications could be so severe for the rest of us.The mishandling speaks volumes about Cummings’s judgment and temperament. His lack of humility when the news broke was striking. To say: “Who cares about good looks. It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think,” to journalists was characteristic Cummings. As so often, a humble apology might have killed the story. But Cummings does not do humble.The outcome will be devastating for the government’s attempts to carry people with them. Public opinion has been noticeably steady through the pandemic. Most people have proved cautious, rule-abiding, risk-averse. Even now, pressure to loosen the restrictions only comes from a minority. It was entirely predictable that the public’s judgments about Cummings this weekend would be overwhelmingly negative. So it has proved. YouGov found that across every region of the UK, and among leave voters and remain voters alike, the majorities are all emphatically against him. What happens to Cummings is important. But the real question posed by the furore goes further. Johnson’s credibility over the handling of the biggest domestic crisis faced by any recent government is in the balance. That credibility is vital in the next phases of the response to the pandemic, which are scheduled to be launched this coming week – a week in which parliament is in recess, a typical Cummings touch. But the implications extend to the Johnson government’s authority in the post-pandemic political world, too.That credibility was already on the line before a word of the Cummings story broke on Friday. Johnson’s fatefully botched broadcast at the start of May started the recent rot. The pressure to loosen the original restrictions came overwhelmingly from the right of the Tory party and some of the media. Johnson – and Cummings – bent to the pressure. “Stay at home” became “Stay alert” – though only in England – and the handling of the pandemic instantly became much harder. New infections and deaths continued. Johnson’s ratings sagged. Confidence in the government dipped. Backbenchers began to revolt again.The Cummings scandal has arrived at a vulnerable moment. Faced with the pandemic, the government – and indeed the country – needed a team that could rise to the demands, and grow impressively into their responsibilities. That has not happened. Few ministers have enhanced their reputations. Several have been found wanting. And Johnson’s own performance since coming out of intensive care last month has been intermittent at best. Charges that he is a part-time prime minister could be laughed off when Jeremy Corbyn made them, but are more damaging now. The qualifications for membership of Johnson’s cabinet – unthinking support for Brexit and unquestioning loyalty to Johnson – seem less sufficient than ever. Few have enhanced their reputations during the crisis.The shallowness of the talent pool goes some way to explain Johnson’s determination, in defiance of so much criticism, to hold on to Cummings. The sight this weekend of elected ministers rushing to the defence of an unelected official was humiliating, not just for them but for British politics. There have often been controversial advisers in modern British politics: Alastair Campbell, Damian McBride, Steve Hilton, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, to name but a few. In the end, though, they all had to go. Cummings’s crisis moment marks an extraordinary inversion.The sight of Tory MPs beginning to turn against Cummings, and thus to some degree, against Johnson, is a sure sign that a political project is foundering. The ultimate irony is that Cummings, who came to power at the head of a populist, anti-elite uprising over Brexit, has now been shamed by an act of supreme elitism and disdain for ordinary people. When it came to the crunch the great despiser forgot that the moral law applies not just to all the rest of us – but to him as well.Bad behaviour and rule-breaking have got Johnson a long way in life. This evening’s free pass to Cummings suggests there is to be no going back, no learning from mistakes, no attempt to grow wiser with new responsibilities. It is a reckless endorsement of an overmighty adviser, a snub to elected politicians on both sides of the Commons, a declaration of war against much of the press, a defiance of the institutional balances within Britain’s system of democratic government and a self-centred, self-indulgent signal to the public that the rules no longer really matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a3b3e3c4a529af182c7757cf160fd124388acc/0_199_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=73ed22e463478e898864bb12ac08bdc8","title":"the guardian view on dominic cummings the unaccountable elite","story":"Boris Johnson’s absurd defence of his adviser shows his contempt for the publicEver get the feeling you’ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister’s friends. The stated message was: “Stay at home”. The unstated: “Do as we say, and not as we do”.The breach of rules by Mr Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the  and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage.It is possible that Mr Cummings acted legally, as the prime minister has insisted. But it is certain that he did not act either responsibly or with integrity. To praise him for following “the instincts of every father” is an insult to every parent who followed the rules instead. Mr Cummings built his power by exploiting the theme that unaccountable elites treat ordinary people as dispensable idiots. In deciding to drive to his parents’ home in Durham, after his wife fell sick, he not only demonstrated his arrogance, but may have put others at risk during any stop on the 264-mile journey.Mr Johnson and his government have been every bit as reprehensible in shielding him. Cabinet ministers – including, extraordinarily, the attorney general and the health secretary – have lined up to defend not only Mr Cummings but his actions. They have put saving one man’s career above saving lives, by portraying the rules as nothing more than guidance to be interpreted by iniduals. Why, now, should the public be expected to abide by them?If Downing Street truly believed that he had done nothing wrong, it would not have obfuscated about where he stayed during the lockdown, nor refused to comment when the  first asked about the adviser being seen in Durham. Nor would Mr Johnson refuse to address the new claims that Mr Cummings further breached lockdown rules by visiting a town 30 miles from Durham – with No 10 instead adopting the Trumpian ploy of attacking “campaigning newspapers”. A growing number of Tory MPs have now said publicly what ministers have said privately, and what is obvious: that Mr Cummings should go. Officials usually take the fall for ministers, not vice versa. That the prime minister has abandoned his already diminished authority for an unelected figure shows that Mr Johnson feels he cannot do without him. The problem is not only what Mr Cummings has done, but what the prime minister does not do.The worst possible course would be for the government to seek to assuage anger or ert attention by announcing or floating a premature relaxation of lockdown rules. Its advice has become increasingly muddied and confusing, and the messages defending Mr Cummings have added to the risks that others will disregard it. In one regard only its position is now clearer: as long as Mr Cummings remains in place, it is saying that lockdown is for the little people. And as long as it treats the public with contempt, it can expect that contempt to be returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b599f7c01c97e2679a1924fd2bbc44afe237070/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80cd4516d0e58e01efc35345fa983a1a 685w","title":"pm accepts some english primary schools may not return on 1 june","story":"Boris Johnson has agreed schools need more time to prepare for restartBoris Johnson is pressing ahead with plans to reopen schools on 1 June but moved to appease councils and teaching unions by acknowledging for the first time that primary schools in England won’t have to reopen to more pupils until they are prepared.The acknowledgment by the prime minister came in his opening statement at the daily Covid-19 press conference on Sunday, in which Johnson said the government wanted primary schools to plan for allowing pupils in reception, year one and year six to return on 1 June.But Johnson took notice of the controversy the 1 June reopening date has sparked among local authorities, parents and teachers, with many saying it was too early, especially in those areas of the north-east of England where coronavirus infection rates remain high.“Now I acknowledge that a June first opening may not be possible for all schools but the government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible,” Johnson said.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said in response: “The government has yet to reassure parents and teachers that opening schools from 1 June will be safe, and now appears to accept that many schools will not be able to reopen on that date.”Johnson also named a later date for secondary school pupils to return, with only year 10 and year 12 - pupils in their first year of GCSE and A-level studies – able to meet their teachers from 15 June.Johnson later told the press conference that England’s schools were likely to have fully reopened by September. Last week the national governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland announced that were not reopening schools more fully until late August.School leaders and teaching unions said they were glad to hear Johnson’s acknowledgement that reopening after the half-term holiday this week was unrealistic for all schools, and that many would need more help.“We welcome the prime minister’s recognition that it will not be possible for all primary schools to open to more pupils from June 1,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.“The reality is that many schools will need to phase back eligible pupils over a period of time, and there will be a great deal of variability across the country.”The prime minister said the Department for Education “will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plan.“The final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures, which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will, of course, continue to consider all the evidence, as we said we will do, and we will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week.”But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said the government needed to “step back” from the 1 June cliff edge.“The 1 June date has become toxic and counterproductive. The government has ended up in an unnecessary debate about ‘when’, when it should have had a much more open dialogue with organisations like ours about the ‘how’,” said Whiteman, writing in the .The NAHT leader – who represents mainly primary school heads and senior staff – also defended the role of the teaching unions in challenging the government over its plans despite the heavy criticism they have attracted from some wings of the media.“Basic questions we’ve asked the government have been interpreted as nothing short of treason. Questions like, what is the scientific rationale for a 1 June return date? Are large groups of children all in one place likely to spread Covid-19 and cause a second spike? It is not unreasonable for the government to have these answers, and to share them,” Whiteman said.“Armed with this information, there is not a school leader in the land who would stand in the way of opening up more widely. Without such reassurances, leaders struggle with the ethical side of opening up, unsure of the risks and therefore unable to mitigate against them.”Whiteman revealed that the DfE’s discussions with unions have been “business-like and open. That’s not to say it is getting everything right, but it really isn’t the case that we’re at loggerheads as some front-page headlines have suggested.”Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England, told Sky News that implementing social distancing for children as young as five “is going to be like herding cats, it’s going to be really difficult. But other schools are doing it abroad and we should be doing the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10dfbd013f41cdbfc0ab74fb2abe2953276f3831/70_0_3435_2062/master/3435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9c2001d0f3f36ec04b437c6a45dc7ca","title":"britains largest solar farm poised to begin development in kent","story":"Cleve Hill, the £450m project producing 350MW, expected to receive go-ahead this week Britain’s largest solar farm, capable of generating enough clean electricity to power 91,000 homes, is poised to receive the greenlight from ministers this week.The subsidy-free renewables park is expected to reach a capacity of 350MW by installing 880,000 solar panels – some as tall as buses – across 364 hectares (900 acres) of farmland in the Kent countryside.The project is expected to be constructed one mile north-east of Faversham close to the village of Graveney and may also include one of the largest energy storage installations in the world.The developers expect to receive a development consent order for the £450m project from the business secretary, Alok Sharma, on Thursday almost three years after talks began with local stakeholders over plans for the park.Once it has the final g0-ahead from the government the developers hope to begin building the Cleve Hill solar farm from early next year, and begin generating clean electricity by 2023.Renewable energy is considered a crucial element in the UK’s plans to end its contribution to the climate crisis by building a carbon neutral economy by 2050, and it could also help spur economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus.The UK’s growing fleet of solar panels has produced record levels of clean electricity in recent weeks, reaching fresh highs of 9.68GW last month and helping the UK energy system to its longest stretch without coal-fired power since the Industrial Revolution.The renewables industry believes the UK’s solar power capacity could rise to 27GW by 2030 after the UK government dropped a block which prevented solar farms and onshore wind projects from competing in subsidy contract auctions.A boom in battery projects could mean the electricity generated by solar panels during the day could help to keep lights on at night too, helping to cut carbon emissions and domestic energy bills.The development partners behind the scheme, Wirsol Energy and Hive Energy, believe the project could help cut the UK’s carbon emissions by 68,000 tonnes a year while generating £1m of revenue for the Kent and Swale councils every year.But local activists have voiced concerns that the scale of the solar park, which is the equivalent of 600 football fields, could do more harm than good for the local area.Helen Whately, the Conservative MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, said the scale of the development would have a “devastating” impact by “industrialising” the countryside.“We’re not talking about a few fields - this would destroy an entire landscape. I want to see us reach net-zero by 2050, but this should not come at any cost,” she told the Sunday  earlier this month.The Campaign to Protect Rural England in Kent has also warned that the proposed battery storage facilities are five times the size of some of the largest storage projects in the world, which could raise the risk of explosions and fire.The developers have rebutted claims from its critics that the project has failed to give due consideration to the safety concerns of local residents, or the impact of the local environment.Cleve Hill won the support of the Planning Inspectorate earlier this month after putting forward plans to preserve native woodland and scrub within the bounds of the site by hosting a habitat management area of more than 138 hectares – including a new bat roost.The planning will include footpaths for ramblers, and a buffer zone of at least 63 metres between the solar park and the Saxon Shore Way.A spokeswoman for the project said the developers had responded to concerns over the scale of the project’s battery storage ambitions “in great detail” during the examination process with the Planning Inspectorate.She added that safety considerations had been discussed “in great length” with the supply chain, the Health and Safety Executive and Kent Fire and Rescue Service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b48776c9d0f5a00dd19043be1c506f77753ac33f/0_215_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1c0570c5e50ad4e0a2019ace7f4249e 740w","title":"model behaviour naomi campbell at 50","story":"As the supermodel hits her milestone birthday, we look back at her life in the spotlight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87fcd3ff25e31b31f345e07e4c4f3a499045d912/0_191_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76f2fd66fdc5aadbf1765b26b701621","title":"diana kennedy the indiana jones of food","story":"She was instrumental in putting Mexican cuisine on the world’s food map. Now 97, Diana Kennedy is the subject of a brilliant filmDiana Kennedy has written nine cookbooks. The first, The Cuisines of Mexico, was published in 1972, is several hundred pages long, and has been widely credited with introducing traditional Mexican cooking to the English-speaking world.Kennedy is 97, white, and English – hardly the ingredients you’d expect to make up a leading authority on Mexican food, but sometimes ingredients surprise you. She lives in the hills of Michoacán, four hours west of Mexico City, on a piece of land she bought decades ago. In culinary circles she is adored. The Mexican chef Gabriela Cámara describes her as “a legend”. Here’s the restaurateur Nick Zukin: “She is a prophet for Mexican food.” And the chef Rick Bayless: “She’s an incredible repository of knowledge.” And Pati Jinich, host of the Emmy-nominated TV series Pati’s Mexican Table: “I think Mexico, as a country, will be eternally indebted to her efforts.”These quotes appear in a new documentary, Diana Kennedy: Nothing Fancy, by the filmmaker Elizabeth Carroll, which charts Kennedy’s remarkable life. For years, Kennedy has travelled across Mexico – from Chihuahua, in the north, to Yucatán, near the borders of Guatemala and Belize – in order to document its food culture, always with a sense of where she planned to go, but never entirely sure where she might end up. (“The important discoveries in my life have always happened by chance,” she has said.) When she arrived in a new town, she would visit its food market, and she’d ask the people she met there where they came from and what they liked to cook and how and which ingredients they used. Were they local? Were they imported from another state? Were they farmed or foraged? Later in life she roamed the country in a pickup. (“I wish my trucks could speak out some of the experiences they’ve been through with me.”) But when she first arrived in Mexico she travelled by bus, “with all the chickens and the pigs”, moving from village to village, region to region, taking great interest in the way food was cooked, the specificities of the recipes to which she was being introduced. She asked question after question. What were the local chillies? What were the local fruits? What were the local herbs? She touched. She tasted. She inhaled – fragrances as well as knowledge. “Anything to escape,” she says in the documentary, “and to learn.”Whenever possible, Kennedy would visit somewhere she had never been before, spending nights in the truck or, when the weather allowed, a hammock. She usually travelled alone. Sometimes she carried a tape recorder, sometimes a pistol. Nothing stopped her her determination was unyielding. She would drive hundreds of miles in order to check a single fact – an ingredient, an exact measurement. In the foreword to The Cuisines of Mexico, the late food writer Craig Claiborne, a close friend of Kennedy’s, wrote, “If her enthusiasm were not beautiful, it would border on mania.” She travelled compulsively, and she was always forthright and urgent, perhaps a little intrusive. “I wanted to know where people lived. I wanted to learn what the landscape looked like. I wanted to know more.” But people always responded generously. They were fascinated by her fascination. So they invited this odd Englishwoman into their kitchens, and she would stay for hours, or days, or even a week. “I felt at home immediately,” she says, “wherever I went.” She would record recipes faithfully – the specific ingredients and the precise measurements – and return to Michoacán, laden with local specialities, to recreate them at home. Whenever she published a recipe, she always mentioned where it came from, and the woman who had shared it with her.Kennedy first arrived in Mexico in 1957. She was born in Loughton, Essex, in 1923. After the Second World War she travelled to Jamaica, invited by a friend and “propelled by lots and lots of hormones”, and then, impulsively, to Haiti. She landed during the revolution, along with several newspaper correspondents, including Paul Kennedy, a reporter with the New York Times. Paul was based in Mexico City. When he returned, Diana followed, “and then began this absolutely fascinating time in love” – with Paul, and then with the country that was now home. They married, and each time Paul left on a reporting trip, Diana left to explore her new world.Paul died in 1967, in New York, where they’d gone so he could receive treatment for prostate cancer. In Manhattan, Diana felt out of her depth. She didn’t know anyone. She was suddenly forced to hustle. She was “terrifically depressed”. Claiborne, the food writer, suggested she teach Mexican cooking, an idea she at first thought was crazy, but soon she was holding lessons in her apartment, “six people in my little galley kitchen, cooking really traditional food. There was a dress designer, there was an actress. And here I was, teaching them how to make papadzules. I mean, hardly anyone in Mexico knew how to make papadzules. It was fun. It was a start.”Later, an editor at Harper \u0026amp Row suggested she write a cookbook, which became The Cuisines of Mexico, and that’s when the work really began. Other cookbooks followed – cultural studies, really – and then appearances on cooking shows (Martha Stewart adored her) and then cooking shows of her own. In front of a camera she was formidable: eager to share what she’d discovered in Mexico but also slightly protective of it, and always straight-talking, almost to the point of rudeness. She would growl things like, “People say they don’t like cilantro. Please don’t invite them!” Or, “Get some texture into your food. We don’t want baby food all the time.” Or, “You might not have a molcajete” – a Mexican mortar and pestle, made of volcanic rock – “so buy one!”But the real work, the work she adored, was the travelling, using food as a way into people’s lives – a “doctoral thesis performed in real time, in real life”. She made the Michoacán house her base. She didn’t remarry. She never wanted children. (“I don’t want to bring up a little me. Can you imagine?”). Instead, she gave herself to work. Carroll describes her as “an anthropologist of food” who “happens to be a killer cook”. She has received heaps of awards, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle (big in Mexico), and a James Beard Foundation Award (big in food land). In 2002, Prince Charles visited Kennedy at her home to appoint her an MBE, for “furthering cultural relations between the UK and Mexico”.Do these things matter to her? It’s not clear. But legacy is important. In a scene from the documentary, Carroll films Kennedy running a cooking camp at her home. Some of the students are accomplished chefs. One owns three restaurants in Manhattan another has five in Portland. But Kennedy is undaunted. At one point she moans: “It is absolutely appalling that Mexico is importing chillies,” and admonishes chefs for not taking a stand. Later she half-shouts:“Learn, learn, learn. Read my books and learn. What are you going to do when I’m gone? Who is going to start screaming?”It’s a pressing question. Carroll filmed Kennedy over the course of six years, starting in 2013. “When we first met her she was 91, running circles around us,” Carroll says. “She was like, ‘Get up, let’s go to the market.’ And we were like, ‘This woman is three times our age!’” But by the end of filming, Kennedy had slowed, “and you could see it was frustrating for her – that it’s not the strength and energy she’s been used to her whole life.” When she spoke at a conference in 2013, Kennedy said, “I am 90, so everybody gets very nervous, you see, that I’m not going to be around much longer. So you’ll want to hear all my complaints while I’m alive.” Recently those complaints have involved sustainability. “We live in such a erse world,” she says, “and our education is so poor. How many kids at school realise how many insects there are? Millions and millions of different types, each playing their part in this marvellous universe.”I was due to speak with Kennedy over the phone, but the call was delayed, and eventually cancelled. She is 97 now. Perhaps she has done all the talking she needs to do. Her legacy is assured. Her cookbooks are still in print. She is beloved by chefs, including José Andrés, who calls her “the Indiana Jones of food”. But “it’s not just rushing in, getting a recipe and coming out,” Kennedy says. “It’s recreating it in your own kitchen. How do you express this recipe so that people can do it, so that it won’t be lost? God knows I tried.” She adds, “You can’t win them all. You just go on doing what you know you want to do, and at some point the tide will turn and you make your mark, or you may not… I’m very honoured the way so many people do look at my books and appreciate what I’ve done. That’s all you can hope for.” Diana Kennedy: Nothing Fancy is available to watch on digital platforms now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a26c72c2f432117710881a71123c9be6a77aee/24_581_6927_4157/master/6927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31b1039f63f44329a3ae9680bf397d96","title":"its time for a takeaway and there is a dazzling array of offerings available","story":"There’s a wide variety available, from literally gilded to cheap and cheerfulIn the depths of lockdown, the arrival of a takeaway can feel like a promising message from a lost world one where restaurants continue to do what they always did. It’s a sudden spike on the emotional heart monitor. A few weeks ago, I said I wouldn’t talk about such things in this column and I never go back on my word. Except when I do. So many intriguing takeaways have arrived at my house recently that to not mention some of them would be a dereliction of my ludicrous duty.Mostly they have been taken in a professional capacity. Oh, that we should all have such professions. Just before restaurants closed, I was recording a third series of my podcast Out to Lunch, in which I grill marvellous people to a turn over a marvellous meal: Dita Von Teese at Norma, Charlie Brooker at Chutney Mary and so on. But we have all had to adapt. So now I stay in for lunch and interview marvellous people by video, with a takeaway.We started outrageously. I was able to send both myself and Edgar Wright, director of Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver, a Chinese. Except it was a gilded, Michelin-starred Chinese from Hakkasan Mayfair, which delivers across the centre of London. By gilded I mean literally so. Gold leaf may have been involved. The pert lobster dim sum, as full and rounded as an Instagrammer’s lips, came topped with caviar. You may now wish me to check my damn privilege. Well I just have. It turns out I have loads. So that’s nice.There was prawn toast, the plump, sesame-crusted minced seafood a fabulously wealthy but distant relative of the dour high-street version. There was finely sliced rib-eye steak with lily bulb with punchy black beans, and a raucous dish of king prawns in a thick, spicy coconut sauce. It all survived the journey unharmed, mostly because it came via Supper, a new high-end, app-based delivery service using bikes with temperature-controlled compartments that has partnered with some of London’s fancier restaurants. Basically, my takeaway arrived by limo. Accordingly, it is not cheap. Main courses start in the high teens, but don’t loiter there for long. (For £120 you can get a two-person menu, with all proceeds going to Great Ormond Street Hospital.) As ever, it’s worth it, but only if you can afford it.Hush now. Here’s something much cheaper. The charming singer-songwriter George Ezra got a bike’s worth of top dishes from the glorious Middle Eastern supermarket Green Valley in Kensington: it featured tabbouleh, pumpkin kibbeh and falafel popcorn, which are two words that had long been waiting for each other. To match him I stumbled upon the delightful Limett Bistro in West Dulwich. They were due to open on 1 April. That obviously couldn’t happen so they moved straight to delivery. Romanian-born George Moldoveanu’s Mediterranean-inspired cooking is vivid, thrilling and a cheery exercise in value.All starters are around £6.50. There is chargrilled pumpkin, spiced with the whipcrack of zatar, alongside crumbly feta and a herb salsa. Humble carrots are roasted with the punch of harissa to give them a leg up, and served with a citrus-boosted hummus, while spiced lamb meatballs arrive with a field-fresh cucumber salad and flatbread. The star is grilled chicken thighs marinated in yogurt, lemon and garlic alongside a mixed pepper stew and a fattoush salad, for £9.There have been others worthy of note: the Vietnamese restaurant Banh Banh, in Peckham, sent me a sweet-sour shredded papaya salad tossed with king prawns, crushed peanuts and crispy shallots, which made me feel like I was being healthy, plus chicken wings glazed in sticky fish sauce and chilli, which made me feel messy. I have also become mildly addicted to the fried chicken from Bird in Brixton, with its undulating crusty skin, full of golden nooks and crannies and spiced echoing crunch. It’s what KFC would be, if it had a career mentor and ambition. That, I ate on my own time.But undoubtedly the most engaging adventure was the readymeal kits dispatched to me by podcast guest Tom Kerridge, full of his familiar bravado and enthusiasm. I couldn’t see the point in sending him a takeaway, when he was supplying his own from his pub, the Butcher’s Tap in Marlow (alongside cooking hundreds of meals a week for the vulnerable). My starter of Isle of Wight tomato and feta salad with garlic pesto, priced at £5.50, had 11 potted elements. I had a jolly time, layering sliced tomatoes, then dressing them with a sticky tomato reduction, a wild garlic pesto, a crispy shallot crumb and many other things besides. Instructions were clear and the heaped, Technicolor result felt like the moment you finish running a bubble bath and it’s just waiting for you, the steam rising.The £9 main course was long-braised ox cheeks in a bordelaise sauce packed full of lardons, red wine and so much gelatine that when it first came out of the box to be heated in the oven, it was solid and rubbery. I didn’t know whether to eat it or play squash with it. There was mustard mash, asparagus and a box of finely ground crispy beef fat. I finished with a remarkably light sticky toffee pudding. No, I wasn’t spared the washing up, but it still felt like someone else had done the important work.A word on packaging. I’ve long fretted over the piles of plastic boxes that each takeaway moment can generate. They might carry a recyclable mark, but who knows whether that means anything? Those who have been involved in producing meals for vulnerable groups from home during this crisis, will now have found them damn useful. A black mark goes, then, to the restaurant local to me which dispatches its food in plastic pots closed up with a heat-sealed film instead of lids, meaning they are useless when emptied. Top marks, however, go to both Bird and Limett Bistro for using a paper-based packaging. And that, I can promise, is the last time I will mention takeaways in this column. Unless, of course, I change my mind.Let’s have a round-up of a few interesting delivery and takeaway options from around the country. French restaurant La Garrigue in Edinburgh is offering both home picnics and three-course meals. Dishes might include gutsy stuff like snail and duck gizzard pie, alongside cassoulet or chicken with a fennel and lemon sauce, followed by a blueberry clafoutis at £23.50 a head (lagarrigueathome). Meanwhile, the team behind both Artusi in Peckham and Deptford’s Marcella have various pastas – bucatini, cavatelli – alongside a variety of sauces from puttanesca to a sausage and saffron ragu, for around £12, while £28 could get you a mushroom and artichoke lasagne for three or four (artusi).In Newcastle, the Grainger Market traders, with support from the city council and a throng of volunteers, has put together a delivery service. It includes a variety of market boxes – fruit and veg, bread, cheeses – as well as selections from the various fishmongers, butchers and delis trading from the site. On 30 May they’re inviting customers to join them from home for a “bloody big afternoon tea” in support of Blood Cancer UK (shop.graingerdelivery).At the other end of the country the lovely Jeremy’s restaurant at Borde Hill, Haywards Heath in West Sussex has teamed up with the onsite café to provide an extensive takeaway menu of dishes that are both ready to eat and to be finished at home. It includes everything from a three-course menu for £35 a head, through a Sunday roast, to scotch eggs and cheese plates (jeremysrestaurant)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64cd61b7a81a2583067507482e23cb30e7060d3/0_1830_5374_3222/master/5374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea93c055d0df1c7d6767d181be44e9b6","title":"nigel slater recipes for lentil pie and asparagus with tomato and yogurt sauce","story":"Bursting with lentils, here’s a veggie pie that packs a punchI need pie. Not a sugar-dusted apple pie or a slim, flaky tart, but a big, fat savoury pie with a deep filling crowned with a cloud of buttery mash. A pie to put on the table to share, into which everyone can dig deep and pile, steaming, on to their plates.This is a recipe that will work for all comers: a sort of cottage pie but without the beef, rich with Italian lentils, aromatics and tomatoes.I will make the filling as if time is of no consequence, slowly stirring the onions and carrots and herbs that lie at its heart over a low heat until they soften and sweeten before adding ripe tomatoes, simmering golden stock and a mountain of squeaky fresh spinach leaves. Two sorts of root vegetables will be steamed and beaten to a fluff, seasoned with chopped herbs and piled high on top of the filling.And yes, my pie will take all morning to make. It will leave me a sink full of washing up and probably bubble over the edge of the dish as it bakes, so I will have to scrub the oven. But we will be fed and happy and full of pie and, frankly, that is all that really matters right now.This is a good-natured recipe that will take whichever lentils and vegetables you have lying around. Use brown, yellow or green lentils in the filling spinach or chard for the greens and mashed potatoes, swede, sweet potatoes or parsnip for the crust.

Remove the leaves from the thyme and parsley, then stir into the vegetables.Cook the lentils in deep boiling water for 20 minutes, until they are just tender, then drain.Cut the tomatoes into small dice and stir into the vegetables, leaving them to simmer for a further 10 minutes until the tomatoes have released their juice.Pour in the vegetable stock, bring to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer, season and leave the vegetables to putter away over a low heat.Check the liquid level from time to time: you want a decent amount of juice, so add some more boiling water if needed. Drain the lentils and add them to the pan.Peel the potatoes and sweet potatoes, then steam or boil until tender. This is best done separately. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or food mixer. Add the butter, chopped parsley, salt and pepper and set aside.Wash the spinach leaves and put them, still wet, into a pan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let them cook for a minute or two until wilted.Remove the leaves, drain them and squeeze out most of the moisture.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Stir the spinach into the lentils then transfer to a deep baking dish, about 24 x 28cm. Spoon the mashed vegetables on top and bake for 20 minutes.As a change from the traditional accompaniment of butter-rich Hollandaise, I’ve been making a light and fresh yogurt-based sauce for my asparagus this season.

You almost need that arrogance to think: ‘Why am I not being picked?’ The reason that I’m at the top fighting, or have been at the top, is because that’s in me.” Hart is 33 and he has been playing professional football for more than 16 years.He made his debut for Shrewsbury the day after he turned 17 and since then has won two Premier League titles with Manchester City, four Golden Gloves and 75 caps for England. After 12 years with City he played for Torino, West Ham and Burnley. But Hart has been in goal for Burnley only three times this season – a Carabao Cup defeat to Sunderland last August and two FA Cup ties, against Peterborough and Norwich, in January. He has been on the bench for all the other games.A simplistic assessment of Hart’s career would suggest it splits into two halves – before Pep and after Pep. Hart was told clearly by Guardiola in July 2016 that he had no future at City. Guardiola cannot be accused of being wrong for, in Ederson, he now has an outstanding goalkeeper who is highly accomplished with his feet. But Hart is intelligent and interested in exploring the blurred boundaries of football. Some of his greatest games – including the 2015 Champions League night at the Camp Nou when Lionel Messi described him as a “phenomenon” – followed soon after adversity. He is also keen to explain that, despite his predicament, his desire has intensified.“It’s got stronger. This lockdown has made me realise how much I want to play football,” he says. “All I want to do is be a big part of something. I understand I’m not going to be part of Real Madrid. I don’t think I’ve lost the ability, but I know how football works. I just want to be a big part of a club and give my all to them. That hope burns through me.”In the meantime Hart is opening up – in this interview and in a BBC programme on football and mental health to be screened on Thursday. He is one of the footballers who Prince William meets in the programme although, as he reiterates here, he has not suffered badly from depression. His career has been in a slump and he wants to share the lessons he has learned. Hart admits “it’s certainly my lowest point” and “I’m sad I’m not playing.” But he sees his long absence from the first team as “a challenge rather than a dark cloud. Mentally, because of what I’ve put in place when I was flying higher and winning leagues, I feel really comfortable talking about my head space. But I also need to speak because football’s difficult.”In the 2013-14 season, when he was dropped by Manuel Pellegrini at City, Hart felt angry. “I didn’t really know how to handle tough moments. You just want to bat everyone away: ‘I’m fine. Just leave me alone.’ I’ve always been keen on my gym work and preparation and a time came when I wasn’t doing those things. It was really frustrating me and a bit of anger came in. Then my place came under threat for the first time.“I had a good relationship with the manager and we decided to get myself right away from football so that, when I came back, I could just enjoy playing again. That’s when I’m at my best. After five or six games I was back in.”Hart helped City win their second Premier League title in May 2014 – having been one of the few survivors who had played for the club before they were taken over by the Abu Dhabi group in 2008. He had been a key figure when they won their first title in 2012 and played under six managers before Guardiola changed everything.During all the ups and downs does Hart still see the same psychologist? “Yeah, I see Jamie on a regular basis. He’s become a huge part of my life and someone I’ll always work with. Having a sports psychologist helped me realise that you can definitely lighten the load if you lean on people. It’s so empowering when you open up.”Those lessons help him now. “I’m going to try and get back in the team. And if I don’t, there’s always another transfer opportunity. There’s no point in sulking. I’m still part of the squad. It gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager. It’s important to have that when you’re doing well. But it’s even more important when you’re not doing well.“I want people who haven’t experienced any adversity in football to learn from this. It’s all very well riding the wave but it won’t last for ever. Every professional I’ve spoken to, has had this ride where nothing can go wrong. Inevitably, it’s hard to maintain. How we react is something I’m keen on trying to help people with – giving them the tools to deal with those situations.”“It’s been tough. That’s no secret. Pure game-time is difficult because, with the greatest respect to Burnley, they’re not a cup team. Staying in the Premier League is all important. It’s just not my time right now. But I’m determined it will come again.”Did he and Guardiola also talk openly before City sent him on loan to Torino? “Yeah, I made sure we had dialogue. I certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke. I listened to what he had to say. There’s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper. I realised he needed to make his stamp at City. He had a direction he wanted to go and he’s not exactly struggled since, has he?”Hart spent a season at Torino and says: “I enjoyed being part of that club. In terms of being in a different country, experiencing a different culture, playing a different league, I absolutely loved it. It’s definitely something I’d love to do again.” Are there clubs looking to sign him next season? “I believe there will be. But they all need to work out exactly what the hell’s going on. I like to think I’m a good catch. I’m on a free contract, I’ve got experience and real hunger. The Premier League has been great for me but I’m more than willing to spread my wings.”At the mention of Serie A, La Liga or the Bundesliga, he says: “I’m totally open. I just want to play at the highest level I can. In England, I don’t feel I am going to be able to do that. Maybe if I hadn’t achieved what I’ve done in this league I might not be so ready to step away. Don’t get me wrong. I’d love to have another big chance in England, but it could be difficult.”Ian Woan, Burnley’s assistant manager tested positive for coronavirus last week, but Hart and his teammates are well. “We’re back training and we’ve got another Covid test tomorrow. This will be the process until we can move forward.”How does Hart feel about the return of the Premier League? “It’s a really interesting time. We’re all involved in this once-in-a-lifetime thing. Right now, the most important thing is health, and helping people that are putting their lives on the line. As long as those guys are looked after, then maybe we’ve got a chance of playing football.”During the lockdown his interest in psychology has been deepened by watching The Last Dance – about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. “I am fascinated by human beings and elite sport. I’ve been blown away by the Jordan documentary. What a beast. What a man. What a one-off mindset. It must have been painful to be that direct and aggressive every day. He absolutely took it to a new level.”Hart has also been savouring the simple pleasures of life away from the bench while supporting Prince William’s mental health campaign. “For our mental health it’s so important to talk about the times we’re feeling good. There are two sides to mental health. Obviously the dark depths are very important. But you need to appreciate when you’re happy and savour the small little smiles, the small little shivers.“One of the greatest things for me is to help people. It can be a simple conversation. Are you OK? Are you all right? I’m looking for a future role where you invest in people and bring the best out of them. Those are the most important moments in life.”Football, Prince William and Our Mental Health airs on Thursday 28 May at 8.05pm on BBC One"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc609e2c94f5260953451ba583b464ebc58e0028/0_248_5118_3070/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6271bc0492883cd82fcd52ba11fe602d","title":"a bride a groom and a booking but no big day yet for lovers in lockdown","story":"Couples, wedding planners and venues speak of the challenges, costs and heartache involved in moving the main event Across Britain, would-be newlyweds are frantically making adjustments to wedding plans thrown into disarray by the worldwide pandemic.Some are rescheduling for later in the year, hoping that the lockdown will ease in time for their big day. Others have postponed until next year to allow the recovery to take hold.Wedding planners, in tandem with the owners of venues, are working flat out to help.Sarah Brookfield-Almond, group director of James’ Places, which runs five wedding venues in Lancashire and north Yorkshire, is concerned about a likely concertina effect as thousands of 2020 brides try to switch to next year.She also points to varying guidance from county council registrars around the country. In Lancashire, she says, registrars have warned that they don’t expect to be conducting ceremonies until September. “It’s less than helpful to have made the decision so early.”Brookfield-Almond claims that many in the industry feel let down by insurers, with only a “tiny number” paying out on cancelled wedding claims. “Wedding insurance is a very specific and specialised product, yet the government doesn’t seem to have asserted any pressure on them to honour these claims,” she says.“All the burden is being left on a hospitality and wedding venue industry that is already seriously challenged.”The couple were due to marry at Caerphilly register office, south Wales, on 2 MaySharon Lovesey, 44, who works in a call centre, and Mark Evans, 45, a baker, met online last April. Six weeks later, Evans proposed. “As soon as we met, we just clicked and fell in love,” says Lovesey.“We were so looking forward to the day, but it wasn’t to be. We’re gutted.”The couple spent their intended wedding day trying to pretend it was just a normal Saturday. “I could have cried all day, but I managed to hold it back,” says Lovesey. “We were really quiet. We went out to do our food shopping just to keep our minds off it but we kept saying things like, ‘We should have been getting ready now, we should have been having photos done now, the car would be arriving now, we should have been man and wife now’.”On what would have been their wedding night, they watched films and ordered a takeaway. “It was so upsetting not becoming Mrs Evans that day,” says Lovesey.The couple are hoping they can at least have a few witnesses for their rescheduled wedding at the end of June. They also plan to have a blessing next year on their wedding anniversary, followed by a rescheduled honeymoon in Turkey.“It’s the same resort, just a different hotel,” says Lovesey.Originally due to marry in August, the couple deferred their big day to April 2021Lisa Barnish, 28, a Ladbrokes manager, and Sarah Johnstone, 35, marketplace manager for the same company, have been together for two-and-a-half years.“We got engaged on holiday in Barcelona,” says Barnish. “It was me who asked Sarah on the beach.”They were due to get married at the Shireburn Arms, Hurst Green, on 14 August. “We fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in and looked at the amazing scenery,” says Barnish.The pandemic has forced them to postpone both their wedding and a planned honeymoon to Italy in September.“Fortunately, the Shireburn has been amazing and we’ve been able to get a new date of 23 April 2021.”Lisa would have happily kept the various gifts, signs and wedding cake toppers that carried the August date, arguing that “it would be a story to tell, a memory to keep”. But she was over-ruled. “Sarah insisted they would be out of date, so we’re buying new.”Both are “very relaxed” and trying to take the upheaval in their stride. “We’re just grateful that all our family and friends are safe and well.” Lockdown rules permitting, they hope to get away for a few nights to mark their planned wedding date. And just to get them in the party mood, they intend to drink “lots of gin”.The couple had planned to marry in Italy on 30 May.Alex Mason, 27, a sales manager, and Laura McCartney, 24, a nurse, should have been getting married in the garden of an 8th-century monastery on Italy’s Amalfi coast on Saturday.But now the whole event, along with a “mini-moon” in Sorrento and a full honeymoon in Santorini, has been put back to July 2021.Mason and McCartney, both from Wombourne, south Staffordshire, have been together for five years and got engaged in Dublin in December 2017. Laura recalled: “Alex had planned it and stood up to propose in front of a restaurant full of people.”The couple chose Italy for their wedding but then came the pandemic. So far they’ve received a refund from Airbnb but are still pursuing British Airways over the cost of their flights. At the moment the airline is insisting on giving vouchers rather than a cash refund so they can buy fresh tickets – still with BA.McCartney finds it “horrible” to catch glimpses of her wedding paraphernalia bearing next Saturday’s date, but is relieved that everyone on the couple’s 35-strong guest list is still able to come to the wedding next year.“It’s still our dream location, so we’re more than happy to wait to have the day as we intended,” says McCartney. “We are so very lucky to have our family fit and well, and for us to have our health during these scary times.”The couple intend to spend their now-abandoned wedding date “getting some nice food in, cracking open a bottle of wine, watching some movies and having a romantic day together”.McCartney adds: “We know it’s important to remember there are people out there losing loved ones. We’re very lucky to have one another and to be able to get married next year.“It was a blow at first, but we were the ones to actually make the decision to postpone. We didn’t feel it right to get married with everything that was happening. We could have hung on longer, but it was clear from the start that weddings in May – especially the ones abroad – would not be going ahead this year.“My hen do had already been cancelled and it was making us both very stressed and upset. Once the wedding was postponed it felt like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders.“We now are both focusing on just getting through this lockdown, looking forward to seeing loved ones again and hoping everyone stays safe. We will have our special day and it will be perfect even if we have to wait another 14 months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fcc9a9b51e0c89db45bf9c71744af52f9e0a66e/0_238_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43693fffcdc3f1489665f62aff18326d","title":"ariel dorfman sundays with reading forests and coping with lockdown","story":"The author on walking in forests, re-reading the classics in bed and the pleasure of living near his sonAre you an early riser? I only sleep six hours a night, but Angélica, my wife, needs almost double. During the week I’m up at 5am to write, but on weekends I no longer work, after years of overdoing it. So on Sunday morning I read in bed until she’s ready to get up. She can sleep for longer when I lay next to her.How are you coping at the moment? While nobody is prepared for what we are living through, some have been through similar experiences: the distance of the migrant or of exile is a curse, but allows you to grow. My wife is the keeper of our sanctuary, expeditious and hygienic at the best of times. When we have deliveries, she cleans every orange and doorknob meticulously.Are you getting out? We recently moved to the same neighbourhood (Durham, North Carolina) as my eldest son, Rodrigo. Last Sunday, we walked together through a forest and, on both of our minds, was a question: will this crisis lead to something better or worse? Realising the people who bring us food, take care of us and heal us are the most neglected in society was a revelation for many, but will this empathy endure when we emerge? There’s always a smattering of intellectual discourse on our walks, but lately the lighter banter has faded.A special Sunday? On 26 April this year we were supposed to be in Santiago, Chile, to vote in a plebiscite on a new constitution. Of course, that was cancelled. We returned to the US in late February. I find myself in a strange situation: instead of voting on a constitution that will create more democracy, I’m held hostage by a constitution that has allowed Donald Trump – a pathological liar – to become president of this republic despite losing the popular vote.Sunday nights? Angélica and I lie in bed together, and I read to her. Mostly we revisit the classics: right now it’s Dostoevsky’s The Possessed. The art of writing literature is strange, you are creating spaces of encounter for others who’ll find themselves in the space your words produce, but they are explored in solitude. Reading together is a way of enjoying new experiences with the love of my life, which has an added significance now our world has become so confined.

Follow your heart and do something that will properly enrich your lifeThe dilemma I’m 45, with a strong marriage, two kids and a good financial situation (thanks to my husband). I’ve had many different jobs over the years, but retrained in another profession last year and hoped to make a basic income from that. Then the pandemic hit.I chose to leave my work so I could cope with everything. I take care of my parents (my mother almost died of a non-Covid-related issue) and children fundraise shop and deliver food to the many local families in need. My husband is also doing a lot of housework, cooking, etc, as well as working from home. I know I am so privileged, but I feel like a failure. I have not accomplished anything as a professional in years. Friends tell me I ought to be happy and I keep telling myself the same, to no avail. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I feel it’s time to give up the idea of ever making a monthly income and instead be happy being a mother and wife, but I can’t shake the sadness this idea floods me with. I would appreciate any fresh ideas on this.Mariella replies Thanks for writing. I’m flattered that you put pen to paper when your to-do list already sounds quite onerous. It’s clearly a good thing for your community that you’re not handcuffed to your desk or kitchen table frantically trying to hang on to your day job while juggling all your other commitments. But there’s a limit to what we should expect of ourselves. For many people, lockdown is already stretching them too far, thanks to time-consuming drudgery, constant close proximity to others, money worries and the effort of keeping our agitation and fears at bay. If that weren’t already an intimidating convergence of challenges there’s also the full-frontal exposure to our own psyches without all the outside-world distractions that usually keep us from becoming too forensic. Thank you Covid-19 for providing us with the time to find ourselves wanting on so many levels!You are clearly in the thick of it and, despite the many worthy pursuits you are engaged in, you’ve done what we as a species are so good at doing and zoomed right in on your perceived shortcomings. Moving forward in this case looks like it may involve some looking back. Somewhere in your primal beginnings you will have equated your worth with your earning power (or it’s something you’ve learned while standing aside as your husband pursued his career). Either way, income level as a route to self-worth is a notion we’re all having to re-examine at the moment. Those of us who have, until now, entirely wedded ourselves to the workplace, using it, at least some of the time, to dodge more egalitarian pursuits, caring duties or possibilities for personal growth, are now having to think about who we really are once compulsory duties are removed from our schedule.Speaking for myself, I’ve realised how, in lockdown, I am similar to the proverbial decapitated chicken, speeding around all day in virtual circles and gaining little for my efforts bar the sense of being busy and the distraction of keeping my thoughts focused outward.You should be able to see, even from your own letter, how well you are succeeding with the true benchmarks of a good life, which must surely be about the quality of our relationships and our ability to spread our good fortune. For a less demanding person, what you already do would add up to a lot.I don’t think it’s your ability to earn a salary that should be troubling you, instead, I’d be interested in what is preventing you from making a choice and pursuing it. Perhaps nothing feels as satisfying as what you’ve already got. If that’s the case, you should celebrate the luxury of your existence without feeling guilty for having a life others might envy. Curiously, fear of commitment may be at the core of your woes. Disposable income can be a blessing, but it can also prove a paralysing force. If you aren’t working for money, or if your work can’t match the money you already have, where do you find the motivation to step beyond your limits? I like the way you are honest about your assets – and I’d keep a close grip on that husband, he sounds almost too good to be true! But as you rightly point out, what we have rarely informs what we desire. You have the luxury of choosing what to do. In a world full of people who are industrious simply to pay their bills that’s worth savouring and taking advantage of. When this curious pause in our lives is over, the need you describe in terms of the families in your area who are struggling, will be the defining factor of our society. Instead of worrying about how to make a salary that you think will increase your self-worth, I recommend you follow your heart and do something that will properly enrich your life. There are plenty of avenues to choose from, and a big heart coupled with a determination to make good use of your skills seem like perfect qualifications to me.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

But after signing an exclusive deal with Spotify, that is what he may have become, marking a new era for podcasting in the process.To much of the world, Rogan’s name is most associated with the periodic furores that erupt from the marathon interviews around which his podcast is structured.Elon Musk smoking weed during a 2018 interview brought a lot of heat, for instance, as did Bernie Sanders appearing on the show in the midst of his presidential campaign, less than six months after conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was brought on for his second sit-down in as many years.But Rogan’s affably bro-ish demeanour, combined with his sponge-like interview style, has garnered him millions of fans over the thousand-plus episodes of his show, The Joe Rogan Experience. And that has made him a linchpin in Spotify’s plans to transform the world of podcasting.Rogan announced the deal on 19 May, revealing his show would debut on Spotify in September, and become exclusive to the platform some point after that. Terms were not disclosed, but one calculation from 2019 pegged Rogan’s revenue from podcast adverts alone between $50m (£41m) and $250m, with more coming from YouTube, where his shows get a million views in their first 24 hours. Add a premium for exclusivity on top and, says podcaster John Gruber, “it seems likely that Joe Rogan is now the highest paid broadcaster in the world”.The Joe Rogan Experience is the second significant acquisition by Spotify for its growing podcast business, after the company bought US sports broadcaster The Ringer outright for nearly $200m in February.Both deals, as well as smaller forays into exclusive content around topics such as gaming, true crime, and relationship advice, lie at the heart of the Swedish streaming service’s attempts to transform podcasting from an industry built around a mishmash of open standards and traditional advertising into a platform economy – with Spotify at the centre.By requiring Rogan’s listeners to use the Spotify app to tune in, the company gains far deeper data about who, when and where their audiences are that, in turn, can be fed through to advertisers, who are more likely to pay higher rates if they can be assured that the target audience is listening. Control of the player also allows Spotify to vary the advertising to the audience, again increasing revenue.The benefits are familiar web economics, and many see the transformation Spotify has in mind as mirroring the changes to the wider web that unfurled over the 2010s. “Podcasting feels like the web prior to the roll-up of power by Google and Facebook, with a lot of new voices, some very successful and most marginal, but quite authentic,” said Matt Stoller, author of Goliath, a history of monopolies.“Once Spotify has gatekeeping power over distribution and a large ad targeting business, it will also be able to control who can monetise podcasts, because advertisers will increasingly just want to hit specific audience members, as opposed to advertise on specific shows.”But Spotify has competition. Apple – long the corporate leader in podcasting through its control of the Apple Podcast Directory and still the largest global platform for connecting listeners with broadcasters – has started acquiring original podcasts for itself for the first time, according to Bloomberg News. The two companies, in direct competition over music streaming, could be going head-to-head in a second field.Until then, Spotify’s bigger problem is convincing podcast listeners to switch from their favourite app to the service’s own – which may not have access to all the shows available in the open ecosystem. The company is not the first to try, and others, such as Stitcher and Luminary, have struggled to justify themselves to listeners. But Spotify has one big advantage: its app, already used by more than 250 million people a month, could serve to introduce podcasts to a whole new group of listeners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e457b4bb6489ede39631021c6a84d48a899246ea/0_0_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647e89f63aa5df5840a7dabc5a8fc15","title":"best way composting council food waste","story":"My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I’m not sure what I need to compost itEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I think I need to start composting.

Which is not to say he’s superficial: his tastes are deep and wide, and both his “virtual coffee shop”, Tim Peaks, and more recent lockdown listening parties on Twitter have brought listeners together with sincere, infectious enthusiasm.Burgess’s fifth solo album continues that mood in an optimistic celebration that draws a natural line through all his phases.

Cummings’ home is in London, and the government rules at the time were specific – stay at home.The prime minister himself had implored people not to travel and visit relatives. Cabinet Office advice was also emphatic: “Leaving your home – the place you live – to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed. This includes visiting second homes.”Asked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of the exemptions in the coronavirus guidelines, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, suggested that an exemption would be “unless there is an extreme risk to life”. Nobody has suggested this was the case with Cummings and his family.Johnson did not explain how Cummings got to Durham in the first place. Was it by car? If so, did he stop on the way? By train? If so, was he with other passengers? Nor was there any detailed explanation for why the couple’s childcare needs could only be catered for with a 260-mile trip to Durham, rather than in London.Johnson said some of the allegations made against Cummings were false and that he had acted to stop the spread of the virusThough there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.Again, Johnson did not specify which of the allegations he regarded as “palpably false”. But when he was asked a direct question about whether Cummings had taken a trip to Barnard Castle during his stay in Durham, Johnson ignored the question, and said that what Cummings had done more generally was “sensible and defensible”. He said Cummings had been in self isolation for “14 days or more” and had behaved responsibly.But if Cummings did go to Barnard Castle on 12 April, as the  reported, that would seem to be a very clear and obvious breach of the lockdown guidelines, whether or not his 14-day period of isolation was at an end.Barnard Castle is close to 30 miles from the house where Cummings was staying. It is exactly the kind of day trip that ministers, in briefing after briefing, have urged millions of people not to make but to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”.Johnson said Cummings had behaved as any parent would have done, and denied it was one rule for some and another rule for othersIs this government asking you – the people, the public – to do one thing, while senior people here in government do something else?… I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that.”The PM’s defence of Cummings’s paternal instincts begged an obvious question that he did not answer.Do instincts come before rules and guidelines? As the Tory MP, David Warburton, tweeted shortly after the briefing: “We’ve all been tasked with tempering our parental, and other, instincts by strictly adhering to govt guidance.”Tim Montgomerie, creator of the ConservativeHome website, went further. “In a pandemic the messages the government puts out have to respected. And if you have a key adviser flouting those rules and no apology, that is a terrible failure on the part of government. That is a terrible undermining of government communications. We have come to realise how reliant Boris Johnson is on Dominic Cummings as an adviser. I’m afraid he has chosen to stick with him. If Johnson loses Cummings, he risks losing the whole operation he has surrounded himself with.”In a tweet, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “The instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2586804016ee8ff5b1af5799c5b359267985172b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d030f414570edaeaa13ecc71bc22fea9","title":"dominic cummings timeline what we know about his movements","story":"How No 10’s claims about the adviser’s breach of lockdown square with the public recordWhen Dominic Cummings was photographed sprinting out of Downing Street on the same day the prime minister and the health secretary were reported to have developed symptoms of coronavirus, observers might have assumed he was racing to attend to vital matters of state. In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic.Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings’s travels.But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the  and Daily Mirror’s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question – and where questions still remain.On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: “My husband did rush home to look after me.” The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country.The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March.Wakefield wrote that Cummings said “I feel weird” and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday – perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway – or Saturday at the latest.The details of the journey from London remain unclear.Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn’t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife.Despite being given notice of the question by Sky’s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. “I’m afraid I don’t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,” he said, adding that he was “expert” in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings’s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents.The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare.But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door.The police have said that on 31 March they were “made aware of reports” of Cummings’s presence in the area.On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the  and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to “reiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel”.The statement confirmed – for the first time – that Cummings had left London for the north-east.But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that “at no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”.This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim.Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings’s presence in Durham by – his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “For one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round” and claiming that security was the “key thing” in the conversation.The following days, by Wakefield’s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a “palace out of polystyrene packaging” with their son even as Cummings’s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital.But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better – just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th – the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic – was 7 April.That Sunday, a passerby told the , they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in “dark coat and thick tartan scarf”, and Abba was playing at full blast.On the same day, the  asked Downing Street about the claims. “It’ll be a ‘no comment’ on that one,” an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the  asked again. Again, the response was no comment.Wakefield did not mention that on 12 April – her birthday, according to Companies House records – they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings’s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having “fantastic views” and “plenty to do for families on a day out”.That detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town.Lees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the  he was “a bit gobsmacked” to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car’s numberplate and checked it online when he got home.While government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings’s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as “fake news” and “a stream of false allegations … from campaigning newspapers”, they have not disputed Lees’s account.His account is awkward for No 10.On Saturday, Shapps – like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister’s most senior aide – repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had “stayed put”.Not according to Lees, they hadn’t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack.He seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period.No mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time.Would a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one’s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government’s “stay home” instruction?That Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. “The new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,” it said, reiterating the importance of “only leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need”.The 14-day period of Cummings’s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. . In a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: “We emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham. asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply. Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot.Could Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not.The denial came after another witness claimed to the  and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents’ property in Durham.According to this account, Cummings said: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?”While Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement.It accused the  and the Mirror of writing “inaccurate stories … including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers.”In interviews on Sunday, Shapps said he understood the sighting in the woods was false. But there has still been no direct on-the-record denial from Cummings himself.The witness who says they saw him on that day, in that place, is sticking by their story, but had nothing more to add."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05e33ea256a0a16af220267b2f64f592dde2ca43/153_164_3402_2042/master/3402.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1ff9eea2c226fab935e78f9e5fca4fdc","title":"the science of making sourdough bread","story":"The transformation of dough into a loaf is chemistry in action. With a bit of physics and microbiology. And love…If bread is rising, sourdough is soaring. Along with pasta and toilet rolls, flour was among the first products to vanish from supermarket shelves and Covid-19 inspired a home-baking boom. While Google searches for “bread” tripled in the UK in the weeks after mid-March, those for “sourdough” rose sixfold. Sourdough differs from most bread in that it contains no baker’s yeast, relying instead on a fermented “starter” of water and flour to provide lift. This also provides its sour flavour and chewy texture.However, many sourdough newbies have found that producing beautiful, tasty loaves isn’t as easy as it looks on social media. Maybe it’s time for a new approach. The transformation of dough into a light and airy loaf is, after all, chemistry in action, with a good side of physics. The complex relationships between the yeasts and bacteria that power starter fermentation are the domain of the microbiologist. Whether you’re a beginner left holding bricks that taste of dough, or an accomplished amateur looking to further up your game, perhaps what you need is a refresher in the science of sourdough.To replace the baker’s yeast that most breads need to rise, sourdough requires some starter – a self-sustaining fermentation of flour, water, wild yeasts and bacteria that produce lactic and acetic acids. You might be able to get some starter from a local baker, or you can make your own – by combining small equal quantities of water and flour and letting it ferment for around five days.Once you have established a starter you need to feed and maintain it with additional flour and water. All-purpose, refined wheat flour can be used. Most enthusiasts prefer stoneground wholegrain flours because they contain more of the microbes and enzymes needed to drive fermentation. They can, however, make a starter higher maintenance, requiring precise timing of feeding. Many opt for a more forgiving rye flour-based starter, and some use flour blends.“When I fed our starter sifted bread and whole wheat flours, it would ebb and flow in health, activity and consistency,” says San Francisco baker Josey Baker (yes, that’s his real name). “I’ve had the best luck with wholegrain rye flour, which seemed to stabilise it in a way that has worked very well for us for years.” An underperforming wheat flour starter that has lost its vigour can be pepped up with a rye flour boost. Some mix in extras like grapes or yoghurt, though this isn’t necessary if you’re using good flour.Rye-based starters attract more heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which produce vinegary acetic acid and give bread sour, fruity flavours. Wheat flours encourage homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which only produce lactic acid, making for softer, cereal flavours, while wholewheat adds a malty, nutty taste.Use of more water and warm weather encourages microbes that will generate a sweeter-tasting loaf. To add sourness, rest your dough in the fridge, possibly overnight, as lower temperatures favour the activity of bacteria that produce acetic acid.Some bakers in San Francisco, which is famous for its sourdough, swear their loaves can’t be produced elsewhere. There is a species of lactic acid bacteria called Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, which produces a characteristically sour flavour, although it has been found in sourdoughs across the world.Scientists at North Carolina State University (NCSU) used DNA sequencing to identify the microbes in starters sent to them by more than 500 participants in their Global Sourdough Project. “We found there is incredible ersity across different sourdoughs, even those from the same neighbourhoods,” says microbiologist Dr Anne Madden, of NCSU. In a follow-up study, the team asked 18 bakers from 14 countries to make starters using the same flour and method, and then assembled them in Belgium to make bread. The microbes in their starters were most similar to those in the flour they used, but were also reflected in those found on the bakers’ hands. “This suggests an intimate relationship,” says Madden. “Either the hands are adding microbes to the starters or the starters are adding microbes to the hands.” The group hope to find out more through the Wild Sourdough Project, launched in April, in which they are asking citizen scientists to make starters and record their characteristics.It depends whether you need your bread by lunchtime. Despite much talk to the contrary, there is no gluten in dry flour. Rather, it contains proteins called gliadin and glutenin, which, once hydrated, combine to form gluten, which can absorb twice its weight in water. It is also sticky, stretchy and elastic. The strength and structure of a good loaf rests on a scaffolding of fine strands of gluten. “Your gluten network acts like a balloon that keeps the gas produced by the yeast inside,” says Karl De Smedt, who runs a library of sourdoughs in St Vith, Belgium. The collection currently maintains 128 sourdoughs from 25 countries, some of which date back to the 19th century. “Without a good gluten network your bread cannot rise and you will end up with a brick,” adds De Smedt.Kneading adds energy and oxygen to dough, speeding the development of the gluten, allowing speedier baking. In “no knead” recipes, edges of the dough are stretched and folded back in, and then left to develop. This process is repeated several times, before the dough is left to swell for a longer period. “You only need to knead if you want to be quick,” says Kimbell. “But if you give your dough a proper, vigorous mix, you can also let the gluten develop during a long, slow fermentation.”The water content of your dough is also key. Beginners often slop in too much too quickly and then panic when their dough becomes gloopy and so throw in extra flour. Kimbell’s top tip is to start with about three-quarters of the water in your recipe, mix slowly and add splashes as you go. Greater water content makes for softer dough and bigger bubbles. “It is easier to blow up a balloon with thin skin than one with thick skin, and by adding more water your dough becomes more like a thin balloon,” says De Smedt.If you want larger air pockets, be gentle when handling your dough, otherwise you’ll knock out the gas needed to make them. But while big holes make for nice Instagram pictures, some focus on structure at the expense of more important attributes. “Any fool can make big holes once they understand gluten and water,” says Kimbell. “The true art is in creating something that is complex, soft, tender, nourishing with both sweetness and light sourness.”Sugars and amino acids on the loaf’s surface start to react at about 150C in the Maillard reaction, a process that gives seared foods a distinctive taste and colouring. Add steam into the oven and it will condense on the cold surface of your loaf and delay crust formation. Keeping the bread’s surface flexible for longer allows for a final burst of fermentation and gas bubble production, while also allowing existing bubbles to expand. It allows the loaf to stretch so that it becomes light and airy. Many cook their sourdough in a Dutch oven or under a cloche to trap water vapour from the dough and create steam.The lactic acids in sourdough neutralise phytates in flour that when consumed in large amounts can prevent the body absorbing minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc in bread. They also slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream, lowering the bread’s glycemic index and preventing insulin spikes. The lactic acids also make gluten more digestible, and reduce the chances of gluten intolerance. A study published in December by Prof Marco Gobbetti, of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, in Italy, found sourdough to be more digestible than bread made with baker’s yeast. Sourdough fermented for longer periods made healthy iniduals feel more full more quickly, and those who ate sourdough had higher amino acid concentrations in their blood.That depends who is making it. De Smedt believes it is best approached as a science. Josey Baker believes that to do it properly requires both perspectives. “Ultimately bread is made, not in labs but in homes and bakeries, by people with subjective opinions using their skills, intuitions, emotions and other intangibles that science doesn’t attempt to address,” he says. “If you’re trying to make bread relying only on one or the other, then you’re leaving something important out.”Kimbell agrees that while science can point bakers in the right direction, there’s much more to making a great sourdough loaf than manipulating variables based on data analysis. “You can totally geek out on the amazing science of the microbial fermentation process,” she says. “Or you can slow down, lose yourself in the moment and fall in love with it. You use your hands, your heart and your mind to get to know the dough, feel it, understand it, and sense what it needs. The only other time you get to connect like that is, let’s be honest, when you meet a new lover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6f0007fb6424d95ab2d35176562c6d470115b1/322_0_6532_3920/master/6532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a750d4dfa669f6a12d36bf38871ecf21","title":"elon musks spacex to launch first astronauts from us soil since 2011","story":"Falcon 9 rocket to make history as billionaire seeks to commercialise space travelElon Musk’s SpaceX company hopes to make history on Wednesday by launching the first astronauts into space from US soil in nine years, as the billionaire takes the next step in his dream to commercialise space travel.Donald Trump will be among the spectators at Kennedy space centre in Florida to witness the launch, which has been given the green light despite the coronavirus lockdown.At 4.33pm (2033 GMT) on Wednesday, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is due to take off from launchpad 39A – the same one the Apollo astronauts used to get to the moon – with the Crew Dragon space capsule on top of it.

As a result, some researchers insist that ministers must now consider implementing radical alternative measures to speed up vaccine development.In particular, they argue that Britain should consider deliberately infecting volunteers involved in vaccine-testing projects – in line with World Health Organization proposals to set up such human challenge trials. Earlier this month, the WHO issued a 19-page set of guidelines on how these trials might operate.However, other UK scientists have reacted with horror at the proposal to implement human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine on the grounds that these could cause serious illness and possibly deaths of volunteers who had been deliberately infected with the virus.The dilemma was summed up by Jonathan Ives of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at Bristol University. “If we were to do this, we would be asking healthy people to put their wellbeing and their lives at risk for the good of society at large. On the other hand, taking that risk could speed up vaccine development and save many, many lives. So I think there could be grounds for going ahead with challenge trials, though it would be based on a very finely balanced argument.”As a result, scientists have proposed that human challenge trials could be introduced to test a vaccine quickly and so save thousands of lives by preventing future infections. “Levels of infection in the community are already low, and if this virus behaves like other respiratory diseases and coronaviruses, there may be even lower levels over the summer,” said Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick University Medical School. “There will not be enough people secreting the virus to be in contact with volunteers in vaccine projects. It is just not going to work.”Young argues that human challenge trials should be considered “very seriously” for the UK. These would involve giving volunteers either a placebo or a vaccine, as is normally done in trials. But instead of waiting to find out how the two groups fare without interference, scientists would deliberately infect them with the Covid-19 virus. This would very quickly show if a vaccine works or not.“Only very healthy young people – around the age of 25 – who have given informed consent would be used,” added Young, who points out that such trials have already been used to test the efficacy of vaccines for flu and the common cold.However, these ailments pose relatively low risks to volunteers. Covid-19 can have serious side-effects, mainly for the elderly but also in a few rare cases of young, apparently healthy people. This point is acknowledged by Young. “Before we went ahead with challenge trials, we would need to have developed some very effective therapy – an anti-viral drug perhaps – that could be used in the few cases where something went seriously wrong.”The idea of carrying out human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine was also backed by Professor Arpana Verma, of Manchester University. “Vaccines give us the ability to protect the most vulnerable people in society. That is one of their key strengths. So I think it would be entirely justifiable to go ahead with such trials.”But the proposal was firmly opposed by immunologist Professor Eleanor Riley of Edinburgh University. “Challenge studies are done for many diseases but only when strict criteria are followed. Firstly, the virus should be really well studied and its clinical behaviour understood in detail. It should also be incapable of causing severe illness in healthy iniduals, or there should be a highly effective drug to clear the infection. None of these criteria are met for Covid-19, and I would be very concerned to hear challenge studies were being planned.”The crucial point is that we should be thinking now whether we want to go ahead with human challenge trials, said Young. “We shouldn’t wait until we have a vaccine candidate on our hands and not know what to do with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4916658a242cd83cce1a108c997965b1fcd2d500/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8988c2ea266e4b5c67b425e877f1545","title":"covid 19 has rocked womens sport but its future remains bright","story":"Hope and determination abound despite the profound challenges brought by coronavirusThe images come from a different time and place: before the sporting world became submerged in sepia and nostalgia, before the great stasis began. Dina Asher-Smith running a bend so geometrically perfect it could have been drawn by a compass before rocketing to the first global sprint title won by a British woman. The Melbourne Cricket Ground swollen with a record 86,174 crowd watching Australia win the Women’s T20 World Cup. England’s Lionesses attracting so many converts and casuals to their cause that unheard of numbers – 11.8m people – tune in for their World Cup semi-final against USA.The most striking sporting photograph of the past 12 months – that of Megan Rapinoe with her arms wide and chin regally tilted in celebration – felt like a metaphor for women’s sport itself: standing tall, oozing attitude, ready to take the fight to all-comers. No wonder that throughout 2019 and early 2020 there was a sense of tectonic plates being shifted and prejudices being shattered. But then came the Covid‑19 pandemic. And with it a clawing fear that what had been made could be rapidly unmade.“The whole industry has been totally rocked by this virus,” says the Women’s Sport Trust co-founder Tammy Parlour. “We have to acknowledge there is a very real threat to women’s sport, especially as under pressure people often revert to the old ways of doing things.”Such evidence isn’t hard to find. When McKinsey produced a report on coronavirus’s impact on the sports industry it grouped women’s football alongside youth and futsal in the sport’s food chain. Meanwhile, the incessant chatter about sport’s return focuses largely on men’s sport – with little concern about the lengthier lockdown of women’s sport. With the FA’s Women’s Super League about to be cancelled, the athletics and tennis seasons in limbo, and the prospects for women’s cricket uncertain, it is entirely possible that professional sport could be female-free zone stretching into the autumn – aside, perhaps, from an occasional sighting of a female jockey.Contrast that with Germany, where the Frauen Bundesliga will start up again next week. “We can’t just rush to get men’s sport back and not think about women’s sport,” says Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, one of Britain’s greatest athletes. “There has to be a balance and ersity, otherwise some of the strides women have made could be lost. But, as with a lot of the things I have sat on over the years, the default is always men.”Some sports will be hit much harder than others. Olympic athletes are supported financially by UK Sport – but many of those in football, rugby and cricket face far more uncertainty. Zarah Al-Kudcy, Formula One’s head of commercial partnerships development, says: “The irony here is that the sports that have tried to become commercially independent, and more reliant on media rights, are the ones that face more business challenges because they are not getting funding from the government.”It’s not just at the elite level where progress has been abruptly reversed. Sport England, which tracks the nation’s weekly activity levels, reports that the gender gap has widened since the lockdown. “It had been coming down, thanks in part to campaigns such as This Girl Can,” says Sport England’s executive director, Ali Donnelly, “But we are seeing a retreat in the numbers of women being active in the pandemic.”For all the challenges, it is notable how much optimism there is. No one fears a steep retreat to the margins or a return to the bad old days. Indeed, many involved in women’s sport expect it to quickly get a second wind and to not only to survive but to further thrive. “The pandemic will definitely impact on the momentum that we were building,” says Donnelly, who is also a prominent figure in women’s rugby. “But at the same time, there’s expectation from young girls in particular that they will see sportswomen on TV.”It undoubtedly helps that a key priority for most governing bodies is to grow their numbers of participants – and the easiest way to do that is through supporting the women’s game. “Strategically it makes sense for them to keep investing in the growth area of a sport,” says Donnelly. “I also don’t get the sense that a massive sponsorship hit is coming either, because many women’s sports are only on the start of that ladder.”Another crucial factor is that there is far greater public expectation and pressure on sports to invest in their women’s programmes nowadays. When Tom Harrison, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s chief executive, appeared before parliament this month he was criticised when he admitted that women’s cricket could not be completely ringfenced if the lack of play this summer cost the ECB £380m. Would that have happened five years ago?But Beth Barrett-Wild, who is in charge of the Women’s Hundred, insists the ECB’s support for the women’s game remains undimmed. “All the statistics and data that we have just shows this upward trajectory that we’re on,” she says. “We know women’s cricket is our single biggest area of growth opportunity – it’s indisputable. And as a business, and not just as a sport with a social responsibility, women’s cricket is just so fundamentally important to what we do.”The Hundred has ided opinion, but Barrett-Wild promises it will herald a huge shift forward for the women’s game. “Being able to properly position men’s and women’s cricket on the same platform, with the same marketing investment, for the first time is really important. Prior to lockdown, I had a couple of really good meetings with BBC and Sky, where we talked about what we are going to do to make the Hundred a real game‑changing moment.”Elsewhere, the next generation of women’s leaders are quietly being developed. The Women’s Sport Trust has used the downtime to set up an “Unlocked” programme for 41 top athletes, providing them with mentors to help them develop what they call “a side hustle” beyond their sport, whether it is in media, marketing or helping the young athletes to come through.One of those involved, the professional boxer Stacey Copeland, stresses that the recent difficulties should be placed into wider context. “When I started it wasn’t even legal for women to compete,” she says. “And yet I’ve been able to compete for my country and win a title as a professional. We’re used to coming up with creative ways to get around barriers. I don’t see why this pandemic should be any different.”Another participant, Alice Dearing, who is hoping to become the first black woman to compete for Britain at swimming in the Olympics, is just as bullish. “This enforced break has been like driving hunger for us: it has only made us more determined to succeed. Yes, women’s sport has taken a knock. But it will come back bigger and better than before.”Al-Kudcy, who is a WST trustee and mentor, says one aim of the scheme is to have more ersity across the ecosystem. “If sports have that across every level of decision-making, they are going to make better decisions. And, what we have seen where there is a lack of ersity, there is often a lack of lateral thinking.”That view is reinforced by Grey‑Thompson. “The Davis review of business made it really clear that women on business boards are vital. Sport is in this really weird place, where it likes to think it is different, but it is not. Governing bodies need to be thinking more about women. The pandemic could be a moment where there is a massive step forward for women’s sport. But that will take greater commitment and not just words.”For the time being those in women’s sport will continue to do what they have always done, even in the darkest and flintiest days when they faced a lack of interest, visibility, sponsorship and money: roll up their sleeves and push on with one eye on a brighter future.“There are little girls who are relying on us to succeed, to make sure they’ve got the role models and a pathway to be successful,” says Copeland. “We are committed to that. We’re passionate about it. And, trust me, we are definitely not going anywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d061cbecb908f46db0efd3e5f2c0f2efa6881b43/184_255_6536_3922/master/6536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d224bd4e1fe159275bb7071351d07fc","title":"knocking down barriers through boxing photo essay","story":"A gym in Bristol has become a vital mental health service for young people with a combination of boxing, psychological support and personal development. Before the lockdown,  Alexander Turner spoke to and photographed the coaches and mentors behind the project – and the young people whose lives have been transformedFounded by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar in 2006, Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) has transformed the Empire Boxing gym – a respected Bristol institution since the 1960s – into a vital mental health service operating in the centre of the city. With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own mental health, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.EFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour – almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK’s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.“We are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society’s most difficult to reach young people,” says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.“Young people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,” says Bisp. “Their distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.” Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.Bisp says: “I’ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we’ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.” Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to “realise their unique potential” and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.Marvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. “I was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,” he says. “Poor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.”Many of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. “The young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,” says Sanigar. “They want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through – visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms … That is challenging enough if you’ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you’ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.”Visiting the gym in 2019, Prince Harry said: “The thought of sitting down in a chair, one to one, with a therapist, can be a real deterrent. However, this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured, but you are.”“A lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything – and they are angry,” Bisp says. “Rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we’re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that’s constructive.”The former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. “I try and get into them that I’ve worked my way up,” he says. “It’s not just sports that that works in, it’s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.” The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people – many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements – can be dramatic. “They know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,” he says. “At school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.”For many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April’s relationship with her coach Courtney “has grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It’s really important.”This type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely inidual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.“The way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you’ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,” says Sanigar. “They can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can’t do that in football. You have your own inidual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.”Ellie, 15, was referred to EFC by her therapist. “I had a really bad home growing up,” she says. “I never had space where I could just go to relax. It was always tension, tension, tension. I struggle with really bad anger issues. They have calmed down a lot, so much, since being here. Even after the first session you could see the difference. I’d keep everything in and wouldn’t let anything out. They really taught me how to open up about how I’m feeling. It’s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life.”Nina, who has PTSD, depression and social anxiety says Empire has made her “less anxious about being in groups, and being with new people”. She adds: “I just feel comfortable being able to come back even if I don’t have to do the sessions. I can speak to someone, it doesn’t necessarily even have to be about what’s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it’s a nice distraction from everything else.”Dontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: “I started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It’s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn’t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.”One issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. “The level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years”, says Sanigar. “This is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over £300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing – no role models, no mentors – it’s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it’s Instagram, Snapchat – all these wonderful lives out there. They are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their self-esteem.”One of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: “I wouldn’t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn’t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don’t have those days when I don’t feel like doing anything because I don’t have the self-esteem or the energy. I’m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that’s quite a big leap.”EFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.“The demographic we have here is very varied,” says therapist Jane Ivall. “Often they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.”According to Rees, “the benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population.

A particular concern was that Huawei would become reliant on unfamiliar and untested components, which could be exploited.Huawei has repeatedly denied that its technology is used for surveillance, and said it would cooperate.Victor Zhang, its vice-president, said: “We are happy to discuss with NCSC any concerns they may have and hope to continue the close working relationship we have enjoyed for the last 10 years.”The Chinese company had become the leading supplier of 5G equipment in a market otherwise dominated by Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland, and was known for producing cheaper kit, which made it attractive to BT and Vodafone.However, British political attitudes to China have hardened since the start of the coronavirus crisis amid complaints that Beijing was slow to acknowledge the seriousness of the disease when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan.On Sunday Seely tweeted that there were “now 59 MPs” in the Conservative Huawei Interest Group – in theory, more than the 44 or so rebels required to defeat Johnson’s government despite the Tories’ healthy Commons majority.Matthew Henderson, director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, said: “This review is recognition that the government’s previous position on Huawei was untenable, both due to the scale of opposition in parliament and from our allies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

Mr President, let’s do have a serious conversation about race in America and how about working for all people that you are supposed to represent, not just the privileged few.”It was the kind of fiery defence Biden would expect from someone talked about as a possible running mate.The former vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in November has committed to choosing a woman. Many – including the interviewer who elicited the controversial comment on Friday, radio host Charlamagne tha God – think the running mate should also be African American.“I don’t even care about the words,” Charlamagne told MSNBC’s AM Joy on Sunday, “and the lip service and the apology is cool, but the best apology is actually a black agenda. They got to make some real policy commitments to black people.”California senator Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams – a target of retweets in dubious taste from Trump on Saturday night – are thought to be the most likely running mate picks.But Demings, a former Orlando police chief, delivered a decent mini-audition for a traditional running mate role by going firmly on the offensive.“It’d be nice to hear other Republicans, male or female, speak out.”In fact many did, including former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who is of Indian heritage and who many think is lining up a White House run of her own in 2024, or could even be considered as a replacement for Mike Pence as Trump’s own pick for VP.“Regardless of color, gender, or class, to label any inidual with what he or she is expected to think, believe, and vote is demeaning and disrespectful,” she said. “Not to mention arrogant and entitled.”On Sunday, CNN host Dana Bash asked directly if Demings wanted to be vice-president. She did not answer directly, but made it clear she would serve if asked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Legislation passed last year by Donald Trump requires the US to sanction officials as undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy. It also requires the US to revoke favourable trade status granted to Hong Kong.O’Brien said the city’s attractiveness as a business and finance hub would also suffer. “It’s hard to see how Hong Kong could remain the Asian financial centre that it’s become if China takes over,” he said, adding that global corporations would have no reason to stay.On Sunday, the Hong Kong government said that criticism from “foreign politicians” of the decision “smacks of double standards and hypocrisy”. In a statement released late Sunday as police continued to detain demonstrators protesting against the measure, the government said: “The vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, including overseas investors, have nothing to fear.”In response to questions about investor confidence in the Asian financial hub, Chinese foreign minister Wang said: “Instead of becoming more worried, people should have more confidence in the future of Hong Kong.”Wang said the laws “will improve Hong Kong’s legal system, bring more stability, stronger rule of a law and a better business environment”.Beijing’s decision has further worsened US-China ties, already at record lows as Washington claims China is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic.Describing the national security laws as a “death knell” for Hong Kong’s autonomy and political freedoms, the US has threatened to revoke the territory’s special economic and trade status. On Sunday Wang said: “It is unfortunate a political virus is also spreading in the US, jumping at any opportunity to attack and slander China. There are those in the US pushing the two sides to the brink of a new cold war.“It is time for the US to give up its wishful thinking of changing China or stopping 1.4 billion people’s historical march toward modernisation.” Wang said China would “emerge stronger, more confident ... in our nation’s unstoppable march to rejuvenation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8799bfe3e0773c21480e58da0b82fbbe8bf97556/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df54dbf052749a58564e3d0f8dba9f7e","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance2","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The UK prime minister has used the daily briefing to lend his support to Dominic Cummings, following reports that his chief strategist broke lockdown rules on at least one occasion.

With normal working life abruptly halted, however, the room was urgently filled with desks and technical equipment, and any plans for relaxation were put on hold. From this temporary prototyping facility, looking out on to his garden, product designer Whitehurst began thinking about what life would be like in a post-coronavirus world.As creative director at a firm called Burgopak, Whitehurst works with a small team of colleagues developing “innovative packaging” for a range of products including bank cards, drinks and small electronics. Now his thoughts turned to how, in a hygiene-obsessed future, people would increasingly reject cash in favour of cards – stored, potentially, in an inventive new style of wallet.Whitehurst has now applied to patent the “magic wallet”, part of what some intellectual property lawyers have reported is a rush of new applications since the lockdown period began. “We’ve certainly seen a lot of people coming to us with Covid-related innovation that they want to protect,” says Mark Richardson, a partner and patent attorney at Keltie LLP, the law firm working with Burgopak. “We’ve had people looking at decontamination systems, PPE, there has certainly been an uptick in that area.”“A lot of it has been people coming and saying, ‘we have talked about this in the past and I would like to progress it.’ They are looking at their long-term future and trying to understand where they are going to be when things go back to normal.”Although precise figures will not be available until next year, according to a spokeswoman for the Intellectual Property Office where British applications are filed, “early indicators suggest that input this year is up on the January to April period last year”.While some of the new applications directly address virus-related problems, others may have arisen from their creators processing a backlog of admin. By contrast, in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, notes Tim Belcher, managing associate at law firm EIP, innovation has slowed due to laboratories having closed.But with the option of patenting ruled out the instant an idea has been discussed with anyone, Belcher says, the impetus to protect a good idea, even under lockdown, is clear. “They need to come to us before they have spoken to possible manufacturers, before they have discussed it with their friend on a Zoom call.”Another innovator who has done that is Atif Syed, CEO and founder of a firm called Wootzano. From a unit in Sedgefield, county Durham, the small company has developed what it describes as “electronic skin”, a highly stretchable polymer that Syed says can detect sensations “the way you and I would, understanding touch, pressure, temperature, humidity”.While it could have many applications, the lockdown has underlined its potential use for robots picking soft fruit, where packing facilities faced with post-coronavirus labour shortages are increasingly looking at automation. The firm has been working on the skin for some time, but the crisis has driven the response from potential customers.One innovation with a very clear potential benefit has been developed at Imperial College, London, where a team of product designers and behavioural scientists have come up with a new product to encourage handwashing in developing countries.“Everyone in the world knows about hand-washing, pretty much,” says project leader Weston Baxter, but research by the team in Tanzania showed that bars of soap were viewed by many as items for laundry and dish-washing, not for washing their hands after using the toilet.In response, they developed a cheap and easily produced soap “tab” and dispenser system which, trials in the country show, dramatically increased rates of hand-washing.In a time of immense new challenges, Baxter says, the opportunities for new ideas are enormous. “Whenever there is a lot of friction like this, it means there is a lot of opportunity for innovation. There has been a lot of very fast trial and error, certainly faster than we have seen in a normal time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a737a7cb7db5a0463ea83d3162d93dd99f2926e/0_416_3854_2313/master/3854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8651889a2485ad73271ae7fa8ca0dcd1","title":"explainer what do we now know about covid 19 and can you get it twice","story":"Your questions answered based on current knowledge and the latest research from scientistsThat remains unclear. A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.But we do have some clues. “We know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,” said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.Dr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.“It is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.” This initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus. That’s because the PCR (or “have-you-got-it”) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.Some people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.“In some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,” said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.”Even some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.Killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear. Immunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.Schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. “In the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring,” he said.A recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.“It’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week,” said Killingley, adding: “I haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.”Schiffer had doubts: “In my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus,” he said. “However, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.”Altmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. “My sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5cb9cad98bec849225945c3913b832c580b3a86/0_346_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a467005209704230d1cf26bcec0eb70","title":"madrid and barcelona follow starkly different paths out of lockdown","story":"As bars and restaurants plan for further easing of coronavirus rules, an argument is raging over terraces and public spaceAs Madrid and Barcelona prepare for the next phase of lockdown loosening, they have radically different visions for how best to return to that crucial part of Spanish life, sitting on a terraza, cup, glass or snack in hand.The two-month shutdown has given restaurateurs plenty of time to weigh up their options. But hopes that the reopening of outside tables will even begin to make up for the lost income appear wildly premature.Madrid city council has said the capital’s 5,323 terraces will accordingly be able to extend along building fronts, across unpaved areas and even, in exceptional circumstances, into parking bays.“We’ve sought to increase flexibility when it came to previous restrictions to contribute to the city’s economic reactivation without reducing the rights of businesses or residents,” it said in a statement.But Juan José Blardony, the head of the capital’s 138-year-old hospitality association, Hostelería Madrid, says that while his members are desperate to reopen, terrace-only operations simply won’t be worth it for most of them.Although Madrid boasts some state-of-the-art terraces, complete with mists of cooling water in summer and industrial heaters in winter, the majority of them are far simpler and far smaller.“Most places that have terraces only have small ones, so it’s not really viable for them to open up just for two, three, or four tables,” said Blardony.In Barcelona, the city authorities have decreed that to compensate for losses incurred by social distancing, the 5,500 bars and restaurants that have licensed terraces may apply to extend the terrace to accommodate four more tables, each with four chairs.In exceptional circumstances, this could be extended to six. A further 3,500 establishments, including hotels and bakeries, that don’t have terraces, may also apply.The catch, however, is they can only expand by occupying existing road space or parking areas. Under no circumstances can they take space away from pedestrians. In other words, pavement cafés can’t take up more pavement.“We have a vision of a city that takes into account everyone’s interests,” Jaume Collboni, the deputy mayor told a press conference earlier this week.Bar and restaurant owners will have to apply if they want to occupy the street. Collboni gave an assurance that applications would be dealt with within a maximum of two weeks.However, in much of the city the stretch of road nearest the pavement is a bus or cycle lane, so many see the plan as unworkable.“In reality, the possibility of enlarging terraces is very limited and the process will be very slow,” said Roger Pallarols, the president of the Barcelona Restaurant Association.“The pavement is the natural place for a terrace to grow,” he said. “Not only are there often no alternatives, it’s also quicker and cheaper to use the pavement.”“Although there is no consensus over the text, we could still arrive at a consensus on its application,” Pallarols insisted.“It seems a good idea to let us have more tables but how are they going to make it work?” asked Patrick Pescetto, who co-founded the Buenas Migas chain of cafés in the city in 1988. “When you phone the town hall, no one has a clue what to do about it.“Ada Colau, the mayor, got votes because people were fed up with tourism. Now there aren’t any tourists, it’s her chance to get votes by helping business to get back on its feet,” Pescetto said. “We employ 150 local people. Having lots of terraces in Barcelona for the people of Barcelona to enjoy would be a wonderful thing.”“They have no concept of what is happening to business in this city,” said one anonymous restaurateur.“Most restaurants will end up with half the number of tables – in most cases two to four – for months while having to pay rent and staff. It’s impossible. There’s going to be an economic tsunami and politicians are letting it happen.”The latest move is part of a long-running dispute between Barcelona council and the hospitality industry over terraces and public space. In recent years the council has reduced the number of tables permitted and imposed higher taxes on terraces.On Saturday, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced  Spain would reopen to its much-needed foreign tourists from July.Blardony says that most of his members aren’t thinking about reopening until the end of June when, if all goes to plan, the capital – and the rest of Spain - will be in the final phase of de-escalation. Counter service will then resume and more people will be allowed to eat inside bars, restaurants and cafes.For the time being though, most of Madrid’s tables and chairs will remain in their chains and solitary stacks.“Terraces have become a big draw for lots of people,” said Blardony. “Both Madrid residents and tourists want to be more in touch with their surroundings and with city life.

Here is a summary of the major developments from this afternoon:If you want to continue following the latest in the coronavirus crisis, pop over to our global live blog. Here’s is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer’s response to the PM’s decision to back Dominic Cummings:The prime minister’s self-centred endorsement of his overmighty adviser is an outrageous snub to the rest of us, writes my colleague Martin Kettle: The poison in Cummings’s journey to Durham is the taint of hypocrisy it injects into the public bloodstream at precisely the time when public confidence in the handling of the crisis is already beginning to fray. One rule for him, another for us. It’s an absolutely lethal tag for any government project, but it’s doubly, triply so in a pandemic. The arrogance and ineptitude are staggering.Read his full piece here:The UK Civil Service has issued a surprisingly honest and direct tweet following today’s Downing Street press briefing on the coronavirus crisis. It has now been deleted but my colleague Claire Phipps had the foresight to take a screenshot for posterity:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has issued a clarification that Johnson’s announcement on the lockdown and the phased re-opening of schools applies to England. She said that the situation in Scotland is set out in the following thread:Johnson is asked whether he knew at the time that Dominic Cummings was making the trip to Durham and whether he approved it. He is also asked whether it is true Cummings made a trip to Barnard Castle in April. Johnson avoids answering the questions directly. “What I can tell you is, when you look at the guidance and the childcare needs, it was reasonable to self-isolate for 14 days or more where he did,” he said. He said that he has looked at the allegations carefully and is content that “on both sides” of that period he behaved “responsibly and correctly”. Johnson is asked whether his support for Cummings means that other people are completely at liberty to do as his chief aide did. “I think what they did was totally understandable,” Johnson replied. “I think any father, any parent would understand what he did.” Johnson also confirmed that the government will press ahead with the phased reopening of schools from June 1. “The education of children is crucial for their welfare, for their long-term future and for social justice,” he said.“In line with the approach being taken in many other countries, we want to start getting our children back into the classroom in a way that is as manageable and as safe as possible.“We said we would begin with early years’ settings and reception, year 1, and year 6 in primary schools.”He added that he intends for secondary schools to provide “some contact” for year 10 and year 12 students from 15 June to help them to prepare for exams next year – with up to a quarter of these students in at any point.Johnson also told the Downing Street press conference that “some” of the allegations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour during self-isolation were “palpably false”.“Though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.”The reactions to Johnson’s announcement that Cummings will stay, apparently without any sanction or Cabinet Office investigation, have begun to pour in:"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Network could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issuesJust Transition Commissioner urges use of second site locations for coastal city businessDavis College pupils in Mallow, Co Cork, scoop top prize for work on plastic pollution"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253430.1589465638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the foreign invaders decimating north s worm population","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe large and admirable Lumbricus terrestris earthworm, key architect of the structure and fertility of soil.To learn that mice, cats and frogs find foreign flatworms too distasteful to eat confirms a general disparagement of the creatures. One shrew, in a laboratory, did manage to tuck in, but shrews must keep eating or die.Sticky, ribbon-flat, pointed at both ends, the dark-brown Arthurdendyus triangulatus from New Zealand and orangey Australoplana sanguinea from Australia are shapeshifting animals, best inspected on the internet.They seem to attract much human curiosity. Three of the Australian flatworms were discovered this month in the vegetable garden of Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE) on the Beara Peninsula in west Cork.A posting of this on the FIE’s Facebook page was viewed more than 17,000 times in four days. Perhaps there was relief from boredom with one plague in sharing the concern about another.Apart from their over-smooth looks, the flatworms’ chief offence is their appetite for earthworms. My drawing is half of their favourite prey, the large and admirable Lumbricus terrestris earthworm, key architect of the structure and fertility of soil. The flatworms’ predatory appetite sparked concern when, in the 1960s, the first New Zealand species was found in a Belfast garden, most probably arriving in the soil of imported plants. The adult animals can last a year without food and pot plants can also contain their egg capsules, resembling small blackcurrants. The global plant trade has also spread this invader to Scotland, the Faroes and the Republic, but its density in Northern Ireland remains exceptional. Scottish records are mainly from city gardens and garden centres but its rapid expansion in the north of Ireland has taken it almost everywhere, across farmland, heather moor, woods and wetlands.An assessment by Dr Roy Anderson of Queen’s University Belfast noted its ability to devastate garden populations of large earthworms. He found only “patchy” evidence of serious damage on agricultural land but he accepted that, with the loss of earthworm drainage and a surface thatch of uneaten leaves, the North’s problem with impacted soil could grow even worse.Moreover, systematic surveys of grass fields found the flatworm in 70 per cent of them by 1998, often at the moister margins of pasture. Concern was especially for the toll on lumbricid earthworms, whose wide vertical burrows make it easy for flatworms to pursue, attack and absorb them. The burrows, topped with fresh casts of earth, bring oxygen and water into the soil, adding greatly to its structure and drainage. They also allow worms to retrieve leaf litter from the surface, digesting and recycling their nutrients. This vital role, first examined by Darwin, is at the heart of flatworm research.In four years of fieldwork, for example, Dr Archie Murchie and Dr Alan Gordon of the North’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute identified and weighed more than 25,000 inidual earthworms. Their 2013 report concluded that a spread of less than one flatworm per square metre, matching “natural infestations” in grassland, would cut earthworm biomass by about one-fifth. This, they said, “poses a serious risk to L terrestris, with implications for soil functioning and indigenous earthworm-feeding wildlife”. Among the latter are the blackbirds, thrushes, seagulls, badgers, foxes and pine martens.The flatworms’ spread in the North is in contrast to sparse occurrence in the Republic, mainly in the disturbed soil of gardens and garden centres. Dr Anderson had pointed to the animal’s intolerance for soil temperatures above 23 degrees, hence its preference for the cooler, moister landscapes of the North.The Australian flatworm, however, is clearly at home under the rocks, pots, plastic sheets and buckets of the Republic’s gardens and plant centres. A map of reports to the National Bioersity Data Centre shows clusters in city gardens, but also in rural Cork and Waterford. This echoes its chief distribution in the southwest of England.‘Left with nothing else’Eye on Nature has already drawn many reports of Australian flatworms and the 17,000 visits to the FIE Facebook resulted in many more. A gardener on the Beara Peninsula wrote of being “left with nothing else”. The FIE has urged more citizen gardeners to search under anything lying on the ground and send their records to the data centre.In the UK, flatworms in imported pot plants engage the vigorous campaigners of the NGO Buglife, which deplores the lack of biosecurity measures to exclude or check for the animals or their eggs. This may well become a cause for the Irish Wildlife Trust, but devising any practical measures will remain a challenging prospect. On both islands, gardeners are urged to uncover, seek out or trap them (the FIE offers ways and means). They should also encourage large, predatory ground beetles, such as the dearg-a-daoil, or rove beetle, that find an appetite for sticky-toffee planarians."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireTackling the coronavirus pandemic has brought the North’s political parties closer together, the First and Deputy First Ministers have said.In a joint interview with Sky News on Sunday, the DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill said the Executive had been faced with the outbreak of the virus shortly after it was restored in January, but their response had demonstrated they could work closely together.“We have shown that we can work together in difficult times,” said Ms Foster. “I’m not saying it’s a good thing that we’ve had a global pandemic, but I think it shows that we have come together and that we can work together in the way that we have.”“I believe that the past number of months, because of Covid-19, has probably brought us closer together,” said Ms O’Neill, “insofar as we are having to work around the clock to take this on.”She was in government “to make it work” while both held different political views, she said, “it’s our job to govern for the people here. Whilst I make the case for Irish unity and Arlene will make the case for maintaining the link with Britain, that’s just politics.”Care homesMs Foster also said tackling coronavirus in care homes remained a “critical battlefield” for the entire Executive. “We still very much want to deal with those issues in a pro-active way.”On Friday a number of frail and elderly residents were relocated from a nursing home in Belfast due to ongoing concerns which related in part to its management of the coronavirus outbreak.According to figures released by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), just over half of the 664 deaths they recorded until May 15th took place in care homes.There have been disagreements in the Northern Executive – particularly over the timing of closing schools – as well as over whether the North should follow UK policy and practice in handling the crisis, or seek to align its approach to that of the Irish government.Yet in recent weeks the relationship between the North’s leaders has improved as the chairs were being set out to ensure social distancing ahead of an Executive committee meeting earlier this week, Ms Foster joked that she and Ms O’Neill had been seeing so much of each other, they were practically the same household.Yesterday she and Ms O’Neill published a joint letter in Northern Ireland’s three main newspapers thanking the public for the sacrifices they have made to protect others during the lockdown.“I think at different times there perhaps was different emphasis but not necessarily a difference in approach,” said Ms O’Neill, “because I think we all shared the same objective of trying to save lives.“We were thrust into this very quickly after the Executive being restored, and that in itself was challenging, but I think that Executive colleagues have worked really closely together to try and turn our way through this as best we can with that one objective, to save lives.”DevolutionBoth politicians were also on the same page when asked about the differences between the North’s roadmap for exiting lockdown and the plans in Ireland and the UK, stressing that their role was to work on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.“If devolution is to mean anything it is about doing what’s right locally for your own people and what we have to do is to listen to the medical and scientific evidence and then make our decisions based on that,” Ms Foster said.“We’re elected here,” said Ms O’Neill. “We’re elected to represent the people that sent us here and to take up government departments and actually make decisions on their behalf, so you can look to London and you can look to Dublin and you can pick good and bad in all approaches, but for me this is about our own response to Covid-19.”However she added: “We do live on an island, we have a geographical advantage, it’s important that we use it to our people’s best advantage in our battle against Covid-19.”The first steps towards the easing of lockdown restrictions began in Northern Ireland this week. The current regulations are due to be reviewed on May 28th.Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill revealed their mothers both had been admitted to hospital during the lockdown. Ms Foster said that the two things she missed most were her hairdresser and congregational singing in church.“We miss the ordinary things that you take for granted and after this is over I hope people don’t take those sort of things for granted, that they actually do value their freedom and their freedom to do all of the things we haven’t been able to do over the last eight weeks.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260462.1590181050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spanish archaeologists recover bones in search for remains of red hugh o donnell","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

Photograph: Eric Luke The party issued a statement in response to Sunday newspaper reports that it would seek to have barrister Roderick Maguire appointed to the role if it formed a government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the coming weeks.“The Green Party would like to clarify that no names have been put forward by the party for the role of attorney general in any potential coalition government,” the statement said. “The party has not discussed possible appointments either internally or with other parties at any level.”The statement came after social media comment about the reports, which centred on Mr Maguire’s reported advocacy for a No vote in the 2017 abortion referendum.Dublin Central TD Neasa Hourigan, a member of the Green Party team involved in government formation talks, said such an appointment, were it to be made, would not be acceptable to her.“With the greatest respect to this member, I have never heard his name. Appointments are decided by the leaders not the core negotiating team. The attorney general is an incredibly important role – as an active Repeal campaigner, this would not be an acceptable appointment to me,” she said on Twitter. Green tánaiste Efforts to contact Mr Maguire and Ms Hourigan on Sunday were unsuccessful. Senior Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael figures played down the prospects of a Green nominee for the position of attorney general.The Green Party declined to comment on reports that it would also seek the office of tánaiste and three cabinet posts if entering government. However, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil sources were dismissive of any Green bid for the tánaiste’s office, with the expectation that the office would be beefed up and first held by Leo Varadkar if the talks conclude successfully. Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin would take the taoiseach’s office in such an arrangement with the two parties switching places in the government’s third year. Political sources say the Greens are likely to seek and secure cabinet posts with responsibility for climate change, and a new, enlarged department responsible for housing, local government, transport and planning. The three party leaders are understood to have met last Friday to review the talks, which they believe are progressing well. Negotiations will resume on Monday, with a plenary session involving all the participants, and a module on health policy. Dáil votesWith the election having taken place almost four months ago, there is growing impatience to bring the process to a conclusion among figures in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Some senior civil servants are also understood to have privately urged the politicians to reach an agreement. There is a series of Dáil votes required in the coming weeks on financial measures relating to social welfare payments, and the Dáil and Seanad must vote by June 30th to continue the legislation underpinning the Special Criminal Court. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are likely to renew contacts with Independent TDs this week with a view to securing their support for a three-party coalition – and to provide some insurance that a government can be formed if the talks with the Green Party collapse. Wexford Independent TD Verona Murphy said she had contact with chief Fine Gael negotiator Simon Coveney on Friday. Meanwhile, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil TDs warned on Sunday that the delay in forming a government could mean that a long-awaited review of the local property tax could be shelved for another year. Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath and Fine Gael TD Colm Brophy, who chaired a review of the tax by the Dáil’s Budget Oversight Committee, told the Business Post they hoped it could be reformed this year. However, legislation would be needed to pass through the Dáil before the summer recess if the rates of the tax, unchanged since 2013, were to be altered.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

It will have saved a few road accident lives - things like that - but social damage - domestic abuse, orces, alcoholism - has been extreme. And then you have those who were not treated for other conditions. Having assessed the initial outbreak in China and from the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship, he predicted by March 14 that the UK would lose around 50,000 lives. Prof Ferguson\u0027s modelling that same week estimated up to 500,000 deaths without social distancing measures.I think that the real virus was the panic virus, Prof Levitt told the . For reasons that were not clear to me, I think the leaders panicked and the people panicked and I think there was a huge lack of discussion.The 73-year-old has no background as an epidemiologist, but he assessed the outbreak in China and prepared a paper based on his own calculations. Most countries, he predicted, would suffer a Covid-19 death rate worth around an extra month in excess deaths over the calendar year.In Europe, I don\u0027t think that anything actually stopped the virus other than some kind of burnout, he added. There\u0027s a huge number of people who are asymptomatic so I would seriously imagine that by the time lockdown was finally introduced in the UK the virus was already widely spread. They could have just stayed open like Sweden by that stage and nothing would have happened.Professor Levitt has now analysed the data from 78 nations with more than 50 reported cases of coronavirus. His investigations proved the virus was never going to achieve the type of exponential growth that the researchers at Imperial were predicting at the same time.There is no doubt that you can stop an epidemic with lockdown but it\u0027s a very blunt and very medieval weapon and the epidemic could have been stopped just as effectively with other sensible measures (such as masks and other forms of social distancing), he added.It turns out numbers are played out very consistently when you look at all the places that have been badly hit, particularly in Europe. The token number of deaths before things stop is about one month of natural deaths, which is something like one in a thousand.Based on his estimates, Britain was due to suffer around 50,000 deaths in totals. A lot of things went wrong but I think the main thing is that we just needed to think and discuss things a little bit, he added. I was told on numerous occasions \u0027you are not an epidemiologist, shut up\u0027. I don\u0027t really care. I was just looking at the numbers. I was looking at the cruise ship, looking at Wuhan. The same number held for these places.The virus has saturated, he believes, across Europe. I think the lockdown will cause much more damage than the deaths saved, he added. When I saw the briefing (from Prof Ferguson) I was shocked. I had a run-in with him when I actually saw that Ferguson\u0027s death rate was a year\u0027s worth - doubling the normal death rate. I saw that and said immediately that\u0027s completely wrong. I think Ferguson over-estimated 10 or 12 times. We should have seen from China that a virus never grows exponentially. From the very first case you see, exponential growth actually slows down very dramatically.The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown, social distancing. So you say \u0027there\u0027s going to be a million deaths\u0027 and when there are only 25,000 you say \u0027it\u0027s good you listened to my advice\u0027. This happened with Ebola and bird flu. It\u0027s just part of the madness.Prof Levitt says the global evidence shows the virus fades in dry heat and in much of the western world there seems to be some kind of immunity. The main worry I would have would be in China, he said when asked about the prospect of a second outbreak. I am 73 and I feel very young, he added. I don\u0027t care about the risk at all.

He has become a lightning conductor for the anger of a good slice of progressive Britain. They want revenge, above all for Brexit.But the Cummings question raises another interesting question about what, if any, special privileges should be enjoyed by the people running the country on our behalf. There is a kind of hyper-democratic rancour abroad that refuses to contemplate that our rulers, at least while they are ruling, deserve some special treatment.I do not know Mr Cummings personally (and voted Remain in the referendum). Even his fans concede that he can be erratic, and it is reassuring to see, in several decisions that the Government made before the crisis, that his influence is not as great as his enemies imagine. But he is obviously highly capable, science and data literate, and understands many of the failings of the government machine that have been revealed by the crisis (see his 2014 IPPR lecture, “The Hollow Men”). I think it is in the national interest that he stays.   And his case surely sits in a defensible grey zone. Both he and his wife were ill with the virus, placing their child in a vulnerable position. Short of handing the child to social services, it is hard to see what course of action they could have taken but to fall back on family in Durham. And they were, according to reports, fortunate to have the space in Durham to isolate away from Mr Cummings’s parents in a separate cottage, safe in the knowledge they could now rely on family help. They applied human common sense, and their case is in a completely different category to Professor Neil Ferguson’s romantic liaison, or Catherine Calderwood, the former Scottish chief medical officer, who decided to visit her second home. Both of those breaches of lockdown were completely unforced.In general, of course, the law should apply equally to all, and members of the ruling elite should avoid saying one thing and doing another. But there is also widespread agreement that our rulers, and by extension their closest advisers, are entitled to some special treatment. They are, after all, special people, even in democracies – perhaps especially in democracies – and have a very unusual and demanding job, which we want them to perform to the best of their abilities. Boris Johnson clearly did not get normal treatment at St Thomas’ Hospital. Politicians have bodyguards and, to cite a more trivial example, their cars often have police escorts and sail through red lights to get ministers and their advisers to meetings on time. We do, and should, bend the rules for them. The question is, which actions sit legitimately in that ruler privilege zone and which do not? We decided, for example, a few years back, that awarding yourself overgenerous expenses did not (without telling them). There is an anti-elitist piety, often expressed by the academic or media branch of the same broad elite, that refuses to accept the specialness of rulers. I sometimes think that the combination of mass higher education and social media threatens to make society ungovernable. The broad elite is in revolt against the narrow elite. Everyone thinks they know better. We have seen this in freedom of information rules that make it difficult for ministers and officials to have honest conversations, pushing key decisions into private rabbit-holes. (Though it’s a shame the rules were not applied to the scientific advice being given to ministers, where open critique of the science from other scientists would have been useful.)We want transparent, open government, but it has negative unintended consequences that need to be constrained. The transparency requirements of modern institutions encourage a performative, virtue-signalling political culture that makes it harder for people to identify as establishment insiders and come to reasonable compromises.So it’s important that Mr Cummings stays. Even if his actions were technically outside the letter of the law – which is far from clear – there is, surely, an extreme circumstances loophole, and more broadly we need to cut our rulers (and their top advisers) some slack. David Goodhart is author of ‘The Road to Somewhere’ (Penguin)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan showboating mediocrity london deserves better","story":"Amid the gloom, some glad tidings. Coronavirus is disappearing from the capital. Once the worst-hit region in the UK, London is surging ahead in its recovery. Seventeen per cent of Londoners are now believed to be immune. This is inspirational, not just for regions lagging behind but in providing a compelling case for easing the city’s lockdown. The Government’s ill-timed and indiscriminate quarantine measures have made it utterly crucial to kickstart domestic growth. Yet the UK’s economic powerhouse remains under lockdown.Good thing that we London-dwellers have been blessed with a globally-minded Mayor, then? Sadly, Sadiq “London is open” Khan is missing in action. Instead of fighting to get the city moving, he has only hampered its recovery by hiking congestion charges. His decision to slash underground journeys meant cramming commuters into packed tubes. Under his watch, Transport for London has become a hotbed of waste, protectionism and mismanagement.Though progress remains stubbornly slow, developments suggest the Government is finally rethinking both its one-size-fits-all approach to lockdown, and its indulgent attitude towards Khan’s leadership. A new taskforce, jointly chaired by Khan and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, will look to “restart” London’s economy. The latter appointment bodes well. Jenrick has had a good “coronavirus war” getting rough sleepers off the streets, restarting construction projects and spearheading deregulation measures. He epitomises the anti-Sadiq tendency making sensible decisions without fanfare.With Mayoral elections looming, however, the Conservatives must also contend with the forces of revisionism. Already, Khan is attributing TfL’s £1.6 billion government bailout to the shock of Covid-19, and it is vital that the Tories do not allow this narrative to gain traction. Though no one could expect TfL to weather the shock of a 90 per cent drop in incomes under lockdown, City Hall’s finances were in a parlous state long before the pandemic.While TfL operated at a loss, Khan indulged in costly gesture politics banning “junk” food and and political adverts (he made an exception for the People’s Vote campaign), leaving a £13 million financial hole. He doubled his own PR budget and ramped up City Hall staffing spending. To court favour with the electorate and vested interest groups, he scattered giveaways like confetti, leaving many travelling for free when they could easily afford it. Though his grandstanding played to the vanities of “liberal” Londoners, it was built on arrogant foundations the expectation of infinite subsidy and an assumption that the city belonged to Labour forever.This pandemic – and the patchy response across the four regions – has exposed the limits of Britain’s devolved settlement. Though this taskforce looks unlikely to give City Hall the radical shake-up it deserves, it is heartening to see Westminster finally defend its corner. London is too important to be in the hands of a showboating mediocrity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannonball run record repeatedly shattered us highways empty","story":"When a team of three hurtled across the US at an average speed of 103 mph last year, many believed their Cannonball Run record of 27 hours and 25 minutes would remain intact for years.Then came the coronavirus lockdown which saw highways across the US empty, leaving the roads free for speed-freaks while millions of Americans complied with stay-at-home orders.The temptation of taking on the challenge, which dates back to the early 1970s, has proved irresistible.In just a couple of months the record in the race, popularised in a 1981 film starring Burt Reynolds, has been shattered seven times.A driver, calling him – or herself – Captain Chaos got the journey time down to 26 hours and 38 minutes in an Audi 8 – at an average speed of 106 mph.Now there are unconfirmed reports of at least one motorist – or team - completing the journey from the Red Ball Garage in Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California in under 26 hours.Speed limits are ignored by contestants in the unofficial race, which sees drivers putting their pedal to the metal as they race along deserted straight highways.Dodging speed traps and evading highway patrols is arguably as important as souping up an engine for cannonballers.Some reportedly use GPS devices and spotters to scan the road for police cars. They have also carried tanks of fuel to minimise the number of pit stops.Ed Bolian, a former Cannonball Run record holder, described the speeds reached by the latest teams as unreal.Certainly, we had some over 110 mph averages through states, they were over 120 mph through several states.How long this record will stand remains to be seen.

On the first Sunday I decided to use my hour of allotted exercise to walk from Hove Lawns to Brighton Pier, the seafront stretch which was the scene of so many good times. Nothing during these two months has left me as sorrowful as that promenade for some reason I imagined that the beach bars would still be open for business (because I saw the esplanade as some fantastic fiefdom which was a law unto itself, like Narnia with hen parties) but of course they were closed. The sun was shining, the canned cocktails were cold – and I felt like I was walking towards my own gallows.Well, what a difference eight weeks makes! I’m proud to admit that I was one of the ocean-going rotters who crowded onto Brighton Beach on Wednesday.I’m burnt to a crisp – but it was so worth it. I love humanity – with the exception of the silly man who has gone viral after a clip of him being interviewed on the very beach where I was basking appeared on Good Morning Britain. Standing there drinking beer, he opined – for all the world like the Homer Simpson of Sussex – “I think we should be stricter like Spain and none of us be allowed out.”He’s not alone in his double-think elsewhere on daytime TV, the presenter Phillip Schofield could be seen clutching his pearls when a woman who lived alone stated her intention to meet up with her similarly self-isolated sister to celebrate her birthday. This would be the same Phillip Schofield who also begged for pubs to open way earlier than planned because “people are going crackers” and “we’ve all got really good at social distancing”.We’re used to people in power being hypocrites. There’s a whole rationale for it de La Rochefoucald’s old saw that “Hypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue”. You could get away with this in a culture of deference which also had no mass media, where the peasants could be scared into believing that they’d burn in Hell if they even contemplated misbehaving themselves as their betters did. But as populism in general and Brexit in particular showed, we no longer live in forelock-tugging times. New plague – same old double standard. Teachers who’ve happily availed themselves of the labour of working-class people for the past two months but think they’re too special to go back to work.Government advisors preaching lockdown and getting around like something out of a Beach Boys song. The sneering on social media at the people licking Mr Whippies on Southend beach which wouldn’t be aimed at some snob swanning around Sandbanks, even though those who bore the brunt of the patronising fury were far more likely to be on furlough, freshly unemployed andor stuck in a small home without a garden. This is just the latest joust in the culture war which has been vivifying – or splitting as the miseries would have it – this nation ever since the referendum.A recent poll by Opinium shows a nation split down the middle, 46 per cent saying the Government is either doing too much or the right amount and 47 per cent saying it’s not doing enough. It doesn’t show who’s on what side but it’s an interesting statistic – and from what I’ve seen I’d bet that those who voted Remain (generally smug stick-in-the-muds) are in favour of a continued lockdown while those who voted Leave (generally reckless rushers-in) want to get things going.The timid may stay at home forever if they wish. But they shouldn’t try to keep the rest of us treading water in the shallow end of life forever, just because they’re scared of the dark and deep.Increasingly, we have the science on our side a new paper in The Journal Of Infectious Diseases shows that while coronavirus can survive for days on indoor surfaces, 90 per cent of it is deactivated in ten minutes when exposed to the midday sun.Even more importantly, what makes us human is other humans without them we are just lackadaisical apes looking at the stars, wondering where we are and pining for an echo of our kind.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western australia battered worst storms decade","story":"Homes were destroyed and tens of thousands of people left without power as a “once in a decade” storm pummelled the western half of Western Australia on Sunday night, with worse expected overnight and on Monday morning.The storm, which is expected to continue well into Monday, was described by Bureau of Meteorology state manager James Ashley as a “dynamic and complex” weather formation caused by ex-Tropical Cyclone Mangga interacting with a cold front.Winds of more than 100kmh destroyed power lines and tore roofs from homes and businesses late on Sunday and the storm was expected to worsen overnight as it moved south along the coast, with winds up 130kmh predicted.Western Power spokesperson Paul Entwistle told WA Today that about 37,000 homes and businesses in Perth, the state capital, had lost power by Sunday evening, along with 13,000 properties are in Western Australia’s Mid West region, including the port city of Geraldton, where it was reported that rooftops torn from homes collided with power lines.In Perth, a radio tower was believed to have fallen onto power lines in the city’s eastern suburbs, contributing to the disruption of supply. Dozens of traffic lights across the city were knocked out.The entire town of Margaret River, a popular tourist destination about 240km south of Perth and home to 8,000 people, lost power.By late Sunday afternoon, the state’s emergency services had received more than 200 calls for help.A deep low-pressure system was forecast to form off the south-west corner of the state. Mr Ashley told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Sunday that “in a broad area, the south-west of the state will be hit really severely overnight, tonight and into tomorrow”.“I should emphasise it\u0027s pretty much the whole western half of the state that\u0027s getting strong northerly winds at the moment,” he said.The Bureau of Meteorology also predicted ten-metre high waves would hit the south west coast of the state on Monday morning, following seven-metre waves along the Gascoyne to Geraldton coast further north.In Geraldton, more than 400km north of Perth, winds of 113kmh were recorded as the city, along with surrounding areas, were shrouded with dust.Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Jessica Lingard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the “wind is picking up the dust through parts of the Gascoyne and the Central West, but the rain should increase in the coming hours so hopefully that will dampen that down… We are expecting conditions to worsen down the west coast as we move into this afternoon”.The dust storm caused low visibility which complicated efforts to tackle an out-of-control bushfire in the southern part of Waggrakine, in the City of Greater Geraldton.“There is a possible threat to lives and homes as a fire is approaching in the area and conditions are changing,” the Department of Fire and Emergency Services warned on Sunday afternoon.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west must stand china ruthless regime flexes muscles","story":"For many years now, China’s approach to the world – patient, strategic, focusing on the long-term – has been a worry and yet also a reassurance for Western leaders. On one hand, unlike the democracies, Beijing has seemed to have the luxury of time in its attempt to win the “hundred-year marathon”. On the other, its “slowly, slowly” mentality meant China never seemed, in the near-future at least, a serious security threat or geopolitical rival.The pandemic has jolted democratic leaders out of their complacency. Beijing continues to resist an independent international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, but we know it lied to the world about the dangers of the virus, silenced the doctors who discovered human-to-human transmission, and manipulated the World Health Organisation, which is led by a director-general whose election China orchestrated.This behaviour has been compounded by Beijing’s reaction to international criticism. Its “wolf warrior” diplomats and state-controlled media have begun a misinformation campaign, claiming the virus originated in the US, and insisting that those blaming China are guilty of imperialism and racism. Its reaction to Canberra’s support for an inquiry into Covid-19 was to impose tariffs of more than 80 per cent on barley imports from Australia. When the EU’s ambassadors asked to write a column in the state-controlled China Daily, its Ministry for Foreign Affairs censored the text.Beijing’s response to the pandemic shows that China is not just another trading partner, a country that will open up and become more liberal the more it is exposed to Western ways. The Chinese Communist Party is an authoritarian bully at home, spying on its people and persecuting religious minorities. Overseas it is a menace, manipulating international institutions, setting debt traps to bring countries under its control, abusing the international trading system, engaging in industrial espionage and using telecommunications technology to embed itself in societies, economies and security systems.But the pandemic is revealing something else. For China’s attitude and behaviour have changed since the virus started to spread. Its modus operandi over the past few decades can be summed up in a number of Chinese proverbs about strategy. Teaching China’s leaders to mask their true intentions, they advise them to: “Deck the tree with false blossoms.” If a statesman can show enough guile and subtlety, he can trick a rival into making mistakes that allow a rising nation to supplant a superior power. As the proverb explains: “The guest becomes the owner.”Yet since the contagion started to spread, Beijing has allowed its mask to slip. “On the outside,” a proverb recommends, “be benevolent on the inside, be ruthless.” But in China’s recent actions, we have seen not a trace of benevolence.While the rest of the world fought the virus, China declared its intention to build new “research stations” on military bases in the South China Sea. It has become embroiled in a border dispute with India, and some analysts see its hand in another border dispute between India and Nepal. It has sunk a Vietnamese fishing vessel in disputed waters and threatened to shoot down Taiwanese aircraft. In reaffirming its commitment to reunification with Taiwan, it has dropped its promise that reunification must be peaceful.This week, the National People’s Congress will effectively end the “one country, two systems” policy in Hong Kong. This policy was the result of the deal struck between Britain and China in the Joint Declaration of 1984. Hong Kong would become Chinese sovereign territory by 1997, but its judicial system, capitalist economy, civil rights and governing autonomy would not change for 50 years.Beijing has slowly eroded the autonomy of Hong Kong, but what it now proposes amounts to the abrupt death of “one country, two systems”. In contravention of the Joint Declaration, new national security laws will not be agreed by Hong Kong’s legislative council but imposed on the city by Beijing. The new laws include severe punishments for “subversion” and “colluding with foreign political forces”, which are incompatible with Hong Kong’s civil rights.The Joint Declaration is an international treaty, lodged at the United Nations. In full view of the world, China is defying international law and abrogating its obligations. So why does President Xi feel he can show such ruthlessness?One explanation is that Beijing is panicking. Having unleashed a virus on the world, it faces unprecedented scrutiny from the West and mounting questions about public health and economic growth at home, so it may be that Xi is acting aggressively in order to assert himself. After all, authoritarian regimes can never afford to look weak before their populations: their strength is their very purpose.Perhaps a better explanation is that China has made a conscious decision to become more geopolitically assertive. Already the largest trading nation in the world, some predict the Chinese economy will overtake the US’s within 10 years. Beijing is reportedly increasing its military budget this year by 9 per cent. It is investing $1.4 trillion (£1.1  trillion) in new technologies by 2025. It has tested making the yuan the world’s first digital currency, to protect itself from future American financial investigations and sanctions. In exercises conducted by the Pentagon, China would defeat the US in “every simulation” of a Pacific war.Regardless of the explanation, the West’s old assumptions about China can no longer apply. Xi has already made himself China’s president-for-life. “Great historical progress always happens after major disasters,” he recently declared. For China, that progress means the usurpation of the US as the world’s principal power, and the eclipse of the Western-led international order.That threat is no longer a remote and distant possibility.

Fans of the cult franchise were disappointed after being met with the edited version of Back to the Future II, which changes a scene in which Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) discovers the sports almanac he needs has been replaced by Oh La La magazine.The edit was apparently made to make the film seem more family friendly, but fans were unhappy with the poor quality of the cut and the fact the scene had been edited at all.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGale has since blamed the edit on Universal, who “somehow furnished Netflix an edited version of the movie”. “I learnt about it some ten days ago from an eagle-eyed fan, and had the studio rectify the error,” he told The Hollywood Reporter.Every film and TV series coming to Netflix UK in MayBack to the Future cast reenact iconic scenes during virtual lockdownHow lockdown has led to the creation of brilliant art“The version now running is the uncensored, unedited, original version.”“Apparently, this was a foreign version which neither director Robert Zemeckis nor I even knew existed, for some country that had a problem with the Oh La La magazine cover. I asked that the studio destroy this version.“FYI, Netflix does not edit films – they only run the versions that are supplied to them,” he continued. “So they’re blameless. You can direct your ire at Universal, but I think they will be a lot more careful in the future – and with ‘the future’.The cast of Back to the Future recently took part in a virtual reunion for a special reading of iconic scenes.Back to the Future II\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBack to the Future\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief executive Kathryn Marinello resigned last week following reports of possible bankruptcy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company lost all revenue from mid-March when the global travel industry came to a shuddering halt. Much of the firm’s income is sourced from car rentals at airports but it started missing debt payments in April.Ms Marinello said at the company’s first-quarter earnings conference on 12 May: “No business is built for zero revenue. There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them.”Why businesses should think about going flight-freeBusinesses are a bit more optimistic, but we\u0027re heading for recessionHow the Government is helping UK businesses in the Covid-19 crisisNew insolvency law to stop businesses going bust during pandemicIn the company’s first-quarter report earlier this month with securities regulators, Hertz warned it may not be able to repay or refinance debt and may not have enough cash to continue operations.The report said: “Management has concluded there is substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.”Hertz said in a statement on Friday: “The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company’s revenue and future bookings.“Hertz took immediate actions to prioritise the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity.“However, uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today’s action. The financial reorganisation will provide Hertz a path toward a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a payment holiday will continue to be able to apply until 31 October.”Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise. And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Cummings only did what ANY inherently superior parent would do.”Author JK Rowling has also been responding to political figures attempting to defend Cummings, pointing out that members of the public have “missed funerals of loved ones because of lockdown”.“Many have had to look after their own young children while ill.

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.The repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated. However, one thing is certain: magnetic field observations from Swarm are providing exciting new insights into the scarcely understood processes of Earth\u0027s interior.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a payment holiday will continue to be able to apply until 31 October.”Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise. And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Reports of the decision by Boris Johnson’s special adviser sparked calls for him to step down or be sacked.However, the Great British Bake Off judge appeared to sympathise with Cummings when she quote-tweeted a post by her son Danny Kruger, Conservative MP for Devizes in Wiltshire, which read: “Dom and Mary’s journey was necessary and therefore within rules. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“What’s also necessary is not attacking a man and his family for decisions taken at a time of great stress and worry, the fear of death and concern for a child,” the post continued.“This isn’t a story for the normal political sh**kickery.”Leith added her own comment: “Well said, Danny. How about a bit of kindness and tolerance?” Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, appeared on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday Show on 24 May as he attempted to dodge questions about Cummings.  How lockdown has led to the creation of brilliant artCharlie Brooker mocks government for defending Dominic Cummings“You’ll probably remember, the prime minister during exactly the same period was pretty ill and, in fact, eventually in hospital in ICU, so I don’t think this would have been high on the prime minister’s agenda,” he said.He categorically denied that Cummings went back to Durham after returning to London in mid-April, but failed to rule out reports that he made a sightseeing trip 30 miles from his family home on Easter Sunday.Celebrities including JK Rowling and Charlie Brooker are among those to back the calls, with the Harry Potter author branding Cummings a hypocrite.

The theory is based around season two episode “Mortynight Run”, in which Parnell’s character Jerry Smith is dropped at the Jerry Daycare Centre.  Rick gets a collection ticket for later, which has the number 5126.When Jerry is picked up at the end of the episode, Rick fails to present a ticket, but another Rick appears to ask if their Jerry is number 5126, and they swap Jerrys.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFans believe this means the Rick and Morty depicted at the end of the episode is not the same as the beginning, which in turn suggests that are not always following one version of the characters. “I\u0027m never completely clear, personally, on which particular family we\u0027re with,” Parnell told Digital Spy, saying he believes the theory is “entirely possible”. Rick and Morty fan theory suggests the true origin of Evil MortySnowpiercer TV show is less angry than Bong Joon-ho\u0027s film Netflix to automatically cancel ‘hundreds of thousands’ of accounts“I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the same family we started with. I mean, I don\u0027t know if these are clones of clones, or... I really can\u0027t keep up with all of that,” he said. “And whether or not it\u0027s the right Jerry? Who knows? Maybe one day we\u0027ll find out.”A separate theory emerged this week, as fans thought they’d spotted a hidden meaning in the latest outing, “The Vat of Acid Episode”. In the instalment, Rick devises a “do-over” machine that allows his grandson Morty to “save his progress” in life, and time travel backwards if something goes awry.Every time Morty used it, another alternate version of himself would be killed in a particularly gruesome way.Fans have suggested that this episode could in fact be part of an origin story for the character “Evil Morty”, a jaded and Machiavelian version of the character that has previously appeared in the series thrice (including as a cameo earlier this season).Reddit threads and theories have emerged speculating that the trauma of ”The Vat of Acid Episode” may have left a permanent mark on the character, and that Rick and Morty is building up to the reveal that the evil Morty was in fact one the series leads (sometimes known as Morty C-137), who travelled back in time.Rick and Morty airs in the UK on E4.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Tonight will be largely clear, with some patches of mist and fog, but the clear conditions mean it will be a bit chillier,” he said.“In some rural spots, temperatures could be as low as 3C to 4C, so there may be a touch of grass frost but to be honest, most people will still be asleep by the time it clears on Monday morning.”Created with Sketch.Weather photographer of the year, 2019 Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Temperature Inversioncloud inversion in Snowdonia at dawn.

Average temperatures for May in London usually hover between 18C to 19C.The rest of the week will see similar temperatures, although conditions may be cloudier in northern parts of England and Wales with some outbreaks of rain. Most of the UK can expect to bask in warm, sunny spells.“Although it’s warmer than average, we would not consider this coming warm spell to be a heatwave as we are coming to the end of May,” said Mr Burkill.Britons warned to avoid beaches over bank holiday weekend“The May bank holiday is not expected to break any temperature records – the warmest May bank holiday was in 2018, with a high of 27.6C, and we’re not expecting that tomorrow.”Britons are reminded to avoid crowding at beaches or parks even as the mercury rises, and to practice social distancing if they do venture into outdoor areas to enjoy the weather as the coronavirus lockdown continues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately. Police have confirmed they visited a property in County Durham after Mr Cummings made the  trip from his London home.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”. There is zero chance of him resigning.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How is that fair?”A second, Larissa, protested: “This has just happened to me. Submitted my naturalisation application in January and three days ago I was told to provide evidence of private medical insurance from 2013!”Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message projected onto the White Cliffs of DoverBig Ben, shows the hands at eleven o\u0027clock at nightNigel Farage speaks to pro-Brexit supportersPro-Brexit demonstrators celebrate on Parliament Square The Union flag is taken down outside the European Parliament in BrusselsPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA pro-Brexit supporter jumps on an EU flag in Parliament SquareEU Council staff removed the Union Jack-British flag from the European Council in Brussels, BelgiumPedestrians pass in front of the Ministry of Defence Building on Whitehall, illuminated by red, white and blue lights in central London A Brexit supporter shouts during a rally in LondonPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghPro-EU campaigners take part in a \u0027Missing EU Already\u0027 rally outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA large pro-EU banner is projected onto Ramsgate cliff in KentPro-EU supporters light candles in Smith Square in WestminsterA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament SquareThe five-year old Elisa Saemann, left, and her seven-year old sister Katie hold a placard during a rally by anti-Brexit protesters outside the Scottish parliament in EdinburghPro Europe supporters gather on Brexit day near the British embassy in Berlin, GermanyAnti-Brexit protester hugs a man while holding a placard A decorated, old fashioned fire pump in Parliament SquarePro Brexit Elvis impersonator performs at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexiteers stands with his dog in Parliament SquarePaddy from Bournemouth wears Union colours as he sits next to an EU flag decorated bag in Parliament Square A pro-EU activist plays a guitar decorated with the EU flag during a protest organised by civil rights group New Europeans outside Europe House, central LondonPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA Pro Brexit supporter has a Union Jack painted onto his face at Parliament SquareMen hold placards celebrating Britain leaving the EUPro Brexit supporters dance in the street draped with Union Jack flags at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexit demonstrator spreads his wings during a gathering near Downing StreetPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridgePro-Brexit supporters burn European Union flags at Parliament SquareA man poses for a picture on Parliament Square in a \u0027Brexit Day\u0027 t-shirtPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA man wears a pro-Brexit t-shirtAnti-Brexit demonstrators visit Europe House to give flowers to the staff on Brexit dayPro Brexit supporter wears a novelty Union Jack top hat outside the Houses of ParliamentCustomers Scott Jones and Laura Jones at the Sawmill Bar in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, where a Brexit party is being held throughout the dayA Brexit supports holds a sign in Parliament SquareA man carries an EU themed wreathAnn Widdecombe reacts with other members of the Brexit party as they leave en masse from the European ParliamentAnti-Brexit demonstrators in Parliament SquarePro EU supporters let off flares from Westminster BridgeBritish MEPs Jonathan Bullock, holding the Union Jack flag and Jake Pugh leave the European Parliament, in Brussels on the Brexit dayNewspapers and other souvenirs at a store, near Parliament SquareBrexit supporters hold signs in Parliament SquarePro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a Border Communities Against Brexit poster before its unveiling in Carrickcarnon on the Irish borderNational growers organisation British Apples \u0026amp Pears has renamed a British apple to EOS, the Greek goddess of dawn, to commemorate Brexit dayPro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareBritain\u0027s departure from the European Union was set in law on January 29, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc\u0027s parliament voted to ratify the orce papers.

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimilar to advice in England, schools have been told to limit class sizes to 15 children. This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general.

We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Samer Hamdoun, a congregation member, added: “It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures. But when you look, when you forget the small details, this is the house of God in the end.”Officials said on Saturday that more than 40 visitors who attended a service at a church in Frankfurt after the Covid-19 lockdown was eased had caught the virus, despite adhering to social distancing rules.Restaurants and cafes in Berlin were permitted to open their doors from 15 May but with strict social distancing guidelines which ask people to remain 1.5m away from each other, and force waiters to wear face masks. According to the Robert Koch Institute, 8,216 people in Germany have died from coronavirus while there have been 177,850 cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can announce our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June  - a week on Monday, he added.We then intend from June  for secondary schools to provide some contact for year  and  students to help them prepare for exams next year.Up to a quarter of older students will attend schools at any one time, the Prime Minister said, adding: Were taking a deliberately cautious approach after a very constructive period of consultation.He said full social distancing may not be possible.However, plans to keep children separate include smaller class sizes, keeping pupils in smaller groups, staggered break and lunchtimes, as well as drop-offs and pick-ups, and increased cleaning.The Department for Education has published detailed guidance on the issue, he added.Progress is conditional and provisional he said, insisting that we must all remember the basics, like washing hands and maintaining social distancing.We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the fasterwe stay alert, control the virus and save lives, he said.What we will do is make sure that we stagger things and we pace things and we work directly with you, with local authorities, to make sure that there is a plan, he said.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.The National Education Union slammed the school plan as reckless and warned infection rates were still too high.The union advised members to tell headteachers they were “[awaiting] further advice from [their] union”.More than , schools have now refused to open on June .Some local authorities, especially in the north of England, have advised their schools to stay closed on that date.Doctors also said it was too risky to reopen schools on June  - however The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has since dropped its hardline opposition to reopening.Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of SAGE, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools re-opened.An exclusive investigation by The Sun revealed at least  councils have warned schools under their control could stay shut.Analysis by The Sun found the local authorities cover , primaries.The best way to checkyour school will be open is to stay in contact with them directly by checking their website.Reception, year one and year six are set to be the first year groups toto schools after June .The Department for Education issued guidelines on May  on how schools should enforce social distancing - including limiting class sizes to  students.Schools are told to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around at once.It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.But union boss Kevin Courtney tweeted on May : Education unions intend to work together.Dont engage with planning a June stto wider opening - await further union advice.Meanwhile, General Secretary of The National Association for Head Teachers Paul Whiteman told the Education Select Committee: If social distancing is as we understand it now - the two metre rule to be applied in schools - there are very many schools that are saying it is simply impossible to achieve.He said making sure younger year groups stay at least two metres apart from each other and their teachers and practice good hygiene such as hand washing will be particularly dficult. Schools have been closed since March  - three days before the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown.BURYNo has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet tests set out by unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of infections break out.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school.

In London, there are few new cases, and other regions can be expected to follow the same trend.Yet still we proceed with glacial speed towards a tentative easing an agonising ten days away.Is it likely, in that context, that the Government would take a dangerous punt on teachers’ safety, as unions suggest  No.And Sage’s advice, published tomorrow, says they will be at no greater risk back in class than any key worker.It suits the Left to paint the Tories as rash, callous and indferent to evidence.The opposite seems to be true, to a fault.BORIS Johnson has done the right thing lting the NHS charge for migrant health and care workers.It was unjust that they had to find hundreds of pounds to use the very system in which they work.No one knows better than Boris the vital role they’re performing.And it is a mark of strong leadership, especially in a fast-moving crisis, to be able to admit you were wrong and change course.But the surcharge must continue to apply for workers in other sectors.It curtails health tourism and offsets the cost of treatment . . . and still should.WE understand Rishi Sunak’s fears that the self-employed bailout is ripe for fraud — and his reluctance to extend it.But fair’s fair.The Government cannot shut millions of businesses, then not fully support them.That is a disaster morally, economically and politically.Employees have been seen right.Cut off the cash to self-starters, though, and the lockdown will crumble in minutes.WE asked how Steve Coogan could defend claiming taxpayers’ money for his ­furloughed staff.Turns out he couldn’t.Instead he bleated that he was targeted because of his anti-Press campaign.Rubbish. Coogan is cashing in on a scheme meant to save jobs, not to keep his fortune intact.The public interest in that story could not be more obvious.As for his zeal to “reform” the Press, it is entirely self-serving:To prevent it exposing grasping multi-millionaires like him.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But hang on a minute.Are we absolutely certain it’s going to be completely safe by then  Not just for all the daytrippers and holidaymakers, but for the people who are lucky enough to live in the most scenic and glorious parts of our country.I know a lot of businesses are struggling — especially hotels, BBs, restaurants, and tourist attractions — and they desperately need an influx of visitors in order to survive.But that has to be weighed up against the safety and well-being of local people.It’s especially true in areas relatively free from Covid-.A surge of tourists could have the same sort of catastrophic effect that befell the Incas, Native Americans and tribes in the Caribbean who were decimated by disease when Europeans first arrived on their shores.The last thing we want to do is further spread this cruel virus and create a second wave that engulfs our NHS.It would mean all of our efforts staying at home and being so careful about handwashing and social-distancing would have been for nought.No one wants to see the emergency Nightingale and Louisa Jordan hospitals actually being used to anywhere near capacity.And our vulnerable care homes must not experience more deaths.I’d rather exercise caution and put off any holiday plans until we have this properly under control — hopefully just a few weeks longer.I’ve been very dismayed this week at the way everyone seems to have let their guard down.Social-distancing is nowhere near as stringent, and people are drting into pre-Covid behaviour.Of course we need to get back to some sort of “new normal” but I think this has to be done with baby steps.The hordes of sun-worshippers on crowded beaches on the south coast of England, large groups of friends enjoying picnics and teenagers gathering in big numbers to have a booze-up are a recipe for utter disaster.There’s nothing I would enjoy more than being able to go on my annual trip to Orkney, which was of course put on hold earlier this year.It’s one of the highlights of my year and I can feel the stress oozing out of my body when I set foot on this glorious part of the world.The welcome is warm, the food is enticing, the local gin and whisky are things of beauty and just breathing in the fresh air on those coastal walks is a joy.I’d go back this second, but onlythe people of Orkney want me there, and onlyit’s safe to do so.Again it comes down to having clear, no-nonsense, unfudged information.It’s not good enough just to tell us all to be “alert”.I need someone in charge who is trustworthy to tell me that visiting a UK tourist destination this summer will be safe for all concerned.I desperately want to support our tourist industry and I think most of us will be staying at home this year and exploring attractions closer to home.Our Good Morning Britain GP, Dr Hilary, who has been the nation’s voice of reason during this whole crisis, has said he would not be comfortable taking a flight any time soon and I have to agree.I know the aviation industry is in deep trouble, but I don’t see how you can stay socially distanced on a plane, and personally I’d rather err on the side of caution.I feel desperately sorry for families who have booked their summer hols abroad and are now waiting to seethey will go ahead without the prospect of having to quarantine on arrival.They also need clear direction from the Governmentthey have to apply for refunds on their hard-earned deposits or air tickets.None of us wants to be part of the problem, and we need to do everything we possibly can to stop that dreaded second wave.We just need more clarity before we throw caution to the wind.ONE of the joys of social media at the moment is “singing policeman” Tim Jones, who has been posting videos of himself belting out musical theatre songs in his squad car.Tim, from Gloucester, was overwhelmed by the reaction to his rendition of Rocky Horror Show classic Sweet Transvestite, which received more than four million hits and a fan message from US actress Susan Sarandon, who starred in the movie version.Tim started posting the songs to cheer himself up because he was missing his kids during lockdown and wasn’t in a good place mentally.I hope the praise that has poured in for this talented and handsome fella has helped him cope.He’s an excellent copper but I reckon, with all that charisma, a career in the West End beckons once all the theatres light up again.BEING a step-parent is not always plain sailing, but the delightful Christine Lampard has managed it with her usual kindness and grace.This week she helped celebrate step-daughter Isla’s th birthday and showed what a close and loving relation- ship the family enjoys.Husband Frank, the Cha football manager, has two daughters, Isla with Christine – and -year-old Luna, from his previous relationship, as well as -month-old toddler Patricia with Christine.Christine has forged a close bond with the girls.She’s never tried to be a second mother to them, but a sort of big sister and a good friend – and she’s got it spot on.Even though it’s not easy for any teenager to have such a special birthday in lockdown, Isla clearly had a very happy day with her family, and right now that’s what’s most important.I will be doing my ITV show from am every morning as usual and I want to say thanks for all your kind messages about the show and also all of your feedback on this column.I really appreciate you all getting in touch.See you Monday at am on ITV and here next Saturday as usual.WE have seen the best of people during this crisis.Our frontline workers have been heroic, as have staff in public transport and those emptying our bins.The amount of money raised for the NHS – from tiny tots to OAPs – has been humbling.Captain Tom Moore, who was made an honorary colonel to mark his th birthday, is quite rightly being knighted for his efforts.Not only did he raise £million, he also lted our spirits.Then we have -year-old Dabirul Choudhury, who walked  laps of his garden during Ramadan.This wonderful man has raised £, for those affected by coronavirus both here and in Bangladesh.There’s also -year-old Margaret Payne, who is more than halfway through her challenge of “climbing Scottish mountain Suilven” by going up and down the stairs at her home.She’s already raised well over £, for the NHS, Highland Hospice and RNLI.Sadly, it’s this admirable generation that has been thrown under the bus.Far too many elderly people were sent home from hospital and into care homes to “unblock beds” in preparation for Covid- patients.Crucially, they weren’t tested for the virus, which spread like wildfire in care homes from the Isle of Skye to Brighton, causing patients to die well before their time.Care home workers in particular have been astonishingly brave and resilient, and some have paid with their lives.Their sacrices must never be forgotten.Yet while we see the very best in humanity, this crisis has also brought out the very worst.I’m distraught and angry to learn that more than  NHS workers and police officers have been attacked during lockdown.This includes thugs spitting at and trying to bite frontline workers, and NHS grafters being assaulted by yobs trying to steal their ID cards to use for store discounts.It’s hard to imagine the sort of despicable low-le cretin who would resort to such crimes, especially against those trying to help us through the pandemic.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I therefore switched to red wine, which meant that by nine in the evening my face was in the bouillabaisse.So I alighted on rosé and I’ve never looked back.A lot of people think it can only be drunk at lunchtime on a hot summer’s day. This is ­nonsense.It also works well when it’s raining, foggy, windy, drizzling, cloudy or cold.I’ve drunk rosé on Bonfire Night and Christmas Day. I even took a case to the North Pole.This really is a wine for all occasions.It goes perfectly not just with avocado and salad but also with meat, fish, curry, pasta and cornflakes.Some call it lady ­petrol, saying it’s a girls’ drink.

So we are not talking cutting-edge television here.What you get is a man with Art Garfunkel hair and a Bill Oddie beard who sits there in what look suspiciously like Brutus jeans, painting a picture. That’s it.He has the sort of voice hypnotists use when they are trying to get you to give up smoking, which means you are quickly lulled into a deep, drooling stupor.After five minutes, his picture is starting to take shape and I guarantee you’ll think what I always think – “I could do that”.Five minutes later you’ll be thinking, “I should do that”. And the next thing you know, you’re on Amazon, ordering an easel.This is a big mistake, as painting is much harder than it looks.

It’s not about what you guys think.”Boris Johnson has faced heated calls to sack Mr Cummings today.But an official statement from Downing Street gave Nos full backing and said he didnt break government guidance because he and his we, journalist Mary Wakefield, stayed in a dferent building.A No spokesperson also challenged reports the aide and his family had been spoken to by police.A statement said: Owing to his we being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.Mr Cummings reportedly travelled to Durham so his parents could help with child care while he and his we had Covid- symptoms.He contracted coronavirus at the end of March. At the time Downing Street claimed he was holed up in his London home.A week later, on April , a neighbour spotted Mr Cummings in the garden with his son running around to Abba’s Dancing Queen.They said: “I got the shock of my le, as I looked over to the gates and saw him.“There was a child, presumably his little boy, running around in front. I recognised Dominic Cummings, he’s a very distinctive figure.”The revelation comes despite No telling Brits they must stay at home and not see family to slow the spread of Covid.The move allegedly went against advice, which became law on March , which stated: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.”Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives addresses for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door.Durham Constabulary said they had spoken to Mr Cummings’ parents - which has been denied by No - about his visit.A spokesman for the force said: “On Tuesday, March , our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.“Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.“In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”.The news comes as the coronavirus death toll in the UK hit , today after  more deaths.Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey today called for Mr Cummings to explain himself - or resign.He said: If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines, he will have to resign. Its as simple as that.And in an interview with Sky News today, he said: It looks quite outrageous that the PMs closest adviser has done this.The Labour Party has demanded a very swt explanation from Downing Street over reports that Mr Cummings broke the Governments lockdown rules.A Labour spokesman said: If accurate, the Prime Ministers chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules.The Governments guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel.The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.Number  needs to provide a very swt explanation for his actions.Acting Durham Police, Crime and Victims’ Commissioner, Steve White, called Mr Cummings decision most unwise.But senior Tory officials have come out in support of Mr Cummings today.Minister Michael Gove has taken to Twitter in suppoer od Mr Cummings, writing: Caring for your we and child is not a crime.Chancellor Rishi Sunak also wrote on social media: Taking care of your we and young child is justiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.Journalist Mary Wakefield revealed that No chief Mr Cummings, , spent  days bedridden after collapsing and having spasms.In the article, Wakfield said her husband was nursed by their young son - despite new claims the family had travelled to Durham for child care.She said: My husband did rush home to look after me.He’s an extremely kind man, whatever people assume to the contrary.But  hours later, he said, ‘I feel weird’ and collapsed.I felt breathless, sometimes achy, but Dom couldn’t get out of bed.Day in, day out for ten days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms that made the muscles lump and twitch in his legs. He could breathe, but only in a limited, shallow way.The little oxygen reader we’d bought on Amazon indicated that he should be in hospital, but his lips weren’t blue and he could talk in full sentences, she wrote.She also appears to have suggested the family remained at their London home for the duration of the illness, writing: After the uncertainty of the bug itself, we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.Dominic Raab posted: It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this.And it has been provided: two parents with coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child.Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here."},{"url":null,"title":"left scientific evidence schools reopening disgrace","story":"THE confusion and fear sown among ­parents by militant union leaders and Labour MPs backing a bogus scientic group with a political grudge is a national ­disgrace with disastrous consequences.Official advice from Sage shows some schools can reopen ­cautiously but safely on June .Kids are  per cent less likely to catch Covid-, “likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus” and the “balance of risk is strongly toto school”.And teachers are in no more danger than millions of other key workers.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heartbroken dad Ismail spoke out for the first time to The Sun on Sunday before he flew to their homeland to bury his daughter yesterday.The former Lebanese soldier who moved to the UK from the war torn state ten years ago to give his bright daughter the chance for a better le said: “Aya meant everything to me.“She was worth sacricing my le and leaving my family and my home country behind to make a better le.“It was all worth it because Aya was successful, but she died in the most horric way. All her dreams were crushed by a single bullet.“She never got a chance to graduate, she never got a chance to enjoy her le, she never got to experience any of it.All of this because someone decided it was okay to mercilessly shoot our daughter. She out of all people did not deserve such an ending like this.“I will never recover from this.”Ismail arrived in the UK with Aya, her mum Samar, , and Aya’s elder brother Ibrahim, , and younger sister Assil, .They travelled on a visitor’s visa and Ismail was finally granted settlement last year having gone on to have another son, Amir, five, in Blackburn.The Muslim family grew up in the seaside town of Qlaileh in the south of Lebanon where Aya was already singled out by teachers for her intelligence.Ismail served in the army for ten years from the age of  before retiring and setting up a pizza shop in the picturesque village ten minutes’ walk from the beach.But after he was himself caught in the crossfire and was shot in the back he decided to move the family to Britain for their safety.Aya arrived aged nine only able to say “hello” but picked up English so quickly that “within two months you wouldn’t say she was from another country”, her uncle Ali, , said.She went on to become a star pupil at Blackburn central high school and was named most improved student of the  pupils in her final year.She became one of the youngest trustees in the history of the Childrens Society aged  and went on to study law at the University of Salford.The family enjoyed trips back to their hometown and pictures show Aya celebrating her th birthday on the beach in Qlaileh last year.She had just passed her second year and was looking for a work placement when she was gunned down getting groceries from Lidl for her family during Ramadan.Ismail, who cannot work because of crippling back problems that leave him needing a walking stick, said: “We came to England to find safety, for a better le.How are we supposed to feel safe now “Aya was so excited about what the future held for her, like what car she was going to get once she passed her driving test. All for her to walk down a street and get shot.“How can someone think it’s okay to take someone’s le away like that  How can such a vile human being think it’s okay to crush all her goals and dreams like that “Aya and her mother used to discuss what graduation dress she was going to wear next year, but instead her mother dressed her in her funeral dress.”The Lebanese Embassy arranged for Aya’s body to be repatriated and buried in Qlaileh in a funeral hundreds attended yesterday.Ismail and his we and children flew out on Friday with her coffin.Describing the moment he found out about her death, he said: “We had heard helicopters and police cars nearby.“Her mother sent me to check up on what was happening.

Juggling my work with that of four daughters aged six to  is a challenge. We’re the lucky ones, too, with plenty of space, devices, and so on.Many families don’t have these advantages, and so their children face an uphill struggle to keep up with those who do. Right now millions of kids are falling behind their advantaged classmates, for reasons completely out of their control, and in spite of their parents’ best efforts.The past decade has seen good progress in closing the learning gap between children. Common sense reforms have allowed all kids to benefit from better discipline, richer curriculums, and tougher exams, but those from more deprived backgrounds have benefitted most.However, the coronavirus crisis is putting these gains and more at risk, even though our teachers have performed near-miracles during lockdown.With minimal warning and no extra money, they went from educating and safeguarding millions of children in classrooms to doing so remotely.They did all this while keeping schools open to children at risk and those of key workers, and looking after their own children at home too! We should all be immensely proud of this.Nothing beats being in a class with a great teacher, though. It’s why I’m so keen that kids get back to school as soon as possible, and for the teaching unions to stop blocking this.It’s also why I love the idea of catch-up summer schools during the summer holidays.I can think of loads of reasons why dferent children would benefit from being in school for some or all of the holiday period. Some might need academic support in key subjects. Others might have faced particular traumas during lockdown and need pastoral support or counselling.It could be as simple as wanting to get back into some kind of routine with familiar faces outside of their immediate family. And of course, having access to summer school would make it easier for many families to get in or back to work as we kickstart the economy in this strange new world.Butwe’re going to make it all work we must use our common sense. We should keep things optional, flexible, and fully-funded.It must be optional for teachers and pupils. Staff have been busier than ever. Kids and their families will want to enjoy any freedoms from lockdown by then. A decent break is vital to ensure everyone is refreshed for a challenging start to the school year in September.However I’m confident though that there will still be enough staff - and community volunteers - for summer catch-up. And schools are perfectly placed to get in the kids who need it most.But we shouldn’t expect it to run like normal school. These are not normal times and we won’t have all the usual staff to hand. We have to work around these, and the needs of the children that come in.And that’s why it must be properly funded by the government. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well, and asking people to give up their summer to pull together something of quality will cost.Get it right though, and catch-up summer schools could make all the dference to kids and families in a time of need. It would also be another great example of the dference schools can make when times are tough.Where can I sign up !To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It gives the impression that the decision to walk away from the Royal Family was Meghan’s.“The reality is Harry drove that decision. The book will make that clear and explain why it had to happen.

But there was more than one occasion where she asked himhe was certain it was what he wanted.“And she always made it clear she would support him in whatever he did.”In the days after his shock announcement that he was stepping away from Royal le, Harry, , hinted at his anger that the finger had been pointed at his we for the decision.Speaking at a charity event he said: “Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve.“For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM said Britain will be easing the lockdown and moving to “step two”.He said: “As part of step two we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools, because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future, and for social justice.“So in line with the approach being taken in many other countries, we want to start getting our children back into the classroom in a way that is as manageable and as safe as possible.”But Mr Johnson conceded the date may slip for some, amid warnings by dozens of councils that they will not be able to reopen by the deadline.He said: “I acknowledge that the June  opening may not be possible for all schools.“But the Government will continue to support and work with the sector so that any schools experiencing dficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible.”The Association of School and College Leaders — which represents head teachers — welcomed the acknowledgment that not all primary schools will be able to start back up on June .But its general secretary Geoff Barton said the Government “has not done a good job in building confidence in its plans”.He said: “It has not communicated the rationale for its chosen approach well, and it left primary schools with little time to plan and implement safety protocols.“It is doubtful that any part of the education sector has ever been asked to do so much in so little time.“We would ask everybody to recognise the immensely dficult circumstances and to respect the decisions made by schools.”Earlier in the day, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, warned the schools shutdown risks creating a “lost generation of youngsters”.

They will blame the Tories who failed to warn them how bad it would get.The Government also needs far more urgency over reopening shops, restaurants, pubs and travel — with social distancing — and a more realistic assessment of the tiny Covid risk to most people.The daily death toll, as heartbreaking as it still is, is falling fast. So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places. One in  has the virus.Politicians and scientists are of course terried of causing new deaths. But over-caution could do so too, by impoverishing millions. Nothing is risk-free.Boris must get us out of lockdown fast — and ram home the dire effects of refusing to do so. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re helping to tackle loneliness and isolation. You’re providing meals to people that cannot leave home. You’re helping fund projects that support physical and mental health in communities across the entire nation.We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.But thanks to you, £ million of funding from The National Lottery is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and good causes. This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible. Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

But as tests continue, it is not yet certain that will be the case – and the minister’s vow could set back NHS access to a vaccine developed where, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres. Research and policy officer Roz Scourse said: “There’s no guarantee that the Oxford vaccine will be the one. What happensit’s not,you’re saying things like that  “That nationalistic view is something we’re really concerned about. We’re also hearing similar noises in the US. “We don’t know where the ­effective products are going to come from – we all need to commit to sharing now, becauseit comes from another country, the UK risks not having access to it.” The medical charity raised fears after the UK and US resisted plans for a “patent pool” that would mean sharing a successful vaccine between countries so anyone could manufacture the successful formula. Mr Sharma made his comments in a No briefing last week after AstraZeneca signed a deal to manufacture the Oxford vaccine. He said the UK would have access to the vaccines first but would also ensure it would be ­available to developing nations “at the lowest possible cost”. MSF also said the UK has failed to attach conditions to vaccine ­development funds given to pharma firms, to prevent them from profiteering on any drugs they develop. Ms Scource said: “The public is paying twice for this system – once for funding research and development, again when pharma companies are getting the patent. Unless you’re attaching conditions, this is what’s going to happen. High prices could cripple health budgets.” These fears were echoed by Diarmuid McDonald of campaign group Just Treatment, which last year helped force a pharma firm to drop the price of cystic fibrosis drugs the NHS had said it could not afford.  AstraZeneca has promised not to make a profit during the pandemic. But Mr McDonald said: “There’s a chance we’ll have to vaccinate millions of people every year. If we start seeing AstraZeneca at that point charging high prices, that turns into billions of pounds a year for the NHS every year.” A Government spokesman said: “We are clear that any successful vaccine must be available globally, to give us the best chance of stopping this pandemic. “That is why the UK is the biggest donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to find a vaccine.

Following allegations Mr Cummings had breached lockdown restrictions, Mr Johnson said he had acted responsibly, legally and with integrity. After the announcement at the daily press briefing, the UK Civil Service official Twitter account published a blunt message. The tweet, which has since been deleted, said: Arrogant and offensive. Can you imagine having to work with these truth twisters  The post was retweeted nearly , times and liked by over , people. It was praised by a number of people on social media.

But well played to whomever is running this account. Another said: This is...probably the last day of the person running the official UK Civil Service Twitter account. Conservative MPs had been baying for Mr Johnson to dispense with Mr Cummings after it emerged he had travelled  miles to County Durham in March to self-isolate with his family while official guidelines warned against long-distance journeys. Further reports also suggested he took a second trip to the North East in April, having already ed to London. Mr Cummings denied the fresh allegations, which were reported by the Observer and the Sunday Mirror, and Mr Johnson announced he would be standing by his most senior aide. Leading the Government press conference for the third time since being discharged from hospital on April , Mr Johnson said he could not mark down Mr Cummings for the way he acted. The PM said: I have had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his we were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus – and when he had no alternative – I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent.

In his own words he tells his story... aposIf you’d told me  years ago I’d be giving , women a day an orgasm I would have laughed. But that’s what I do – from the studio at the bottom of my garden. People pay me to experience climaxes, but I never lay a finger on anyone. They’re just listening to my voice. I qualied as an NLP instructor in , and have been a trained hypnotist for  years, originally helping motivate business people to achieve their goals. It’s only in the last five years I have focused on making erotic audio, and it’s the best job in the world. Ironically, it was after my girlfriend left me that I turned my attention to this line of work. While together, we’d enjoyed reading erotic fiction as part of a healthy sex le. She liked me reading saucy extracts, but as a dyslexic it came more naturally to tell my own stories. However, it got to the stage where me speaking sexily to her dominated the whole relationship. She was clearing up the kitchen table once and – just while listening to a mundane voice message I’d left her – had a full orgasm. I know that sounds funny, or you might think ‘lucky her,’ but she said it was a problem because she no longer had control of her own body. She said I could read the weather report and it would trigger a climax. We broke up, but afterwards I thought, can I take advantage of this unusual gt I have   I made up my own story, Lure Me, on my iPhone. I put it on YouTube in , to see what the reaction was. I used some NLP skills and some hypnosis, and set them to a filthy story about being seduced at the beach. Well, with no promotion at all it soon got , hits. I was buzzing. The feedback was amazing, women telling me how intense their orgasm was. I started creating more stories and putting them on other s like Sound Cloud, MixCloud and Pornhub. After three months I invested in equipment and soundproofing, turning my garden office into a proper studio. As demand for my erotic audio recordings increased, and I began charging for it, I did less corporate work. For the past year my income has been solely from erotic audio. I don’t wish to disclose how much I earn, but it’s enough for me to live comfortably.  Now I’ve created  books, with many more in the pipeline. Some are available on Amazon Audio Books, others are only available on my website. The most popular – downloaded by , – is a fantasy about oral sex. Most men would like to be good at giving this, but they’re probably not. In real le, I know I can give a woman an orgasm which lasts an hour, and I hope this translates to my audios. Since the lockdown, I’ve seen a spike in traffic to my website. If you’re not able to get out and socialise, then why not improve your sex le at home  I encourage subscribers, and the UK monthly subscription is £.. For bespoke stories it costs around £. I charge £ for  minutes – but typically they run - minutes long . Customers are loyal because, let’s face it, amazing orgasms are addictive. Half these customers are men, gting their partners their unique desires. It’s a safe way to try a threesome, or experiment with something like BDSM, which you might not feel brave enough to try in real le.  Group sex scenarios are also popular, and not just with humans, but fantastical things like werewolves and even an octopus too, which I wouldn’t have anticipated. I don’t judge. All sorts of things turn people on. One woman asked me to create a fantasy about her masturbating with a cucumber, which she then served in sandwiches to her girlfriends. I never laugh about anything, that would be disrespectful to people who have shared their deepest desires with me. It’s a privilege to have their trust. Respect for women is hugely important to me. Every woman deserves mindblowing orgasms. It’s so rewarding when someone writes to me and says, ‘I’m , I’ve been married for  years, but you gave me my first climax’. The biggest blockage to achieving climax is normally stress, and not fully ‘letting go’. I invite people to tune into what turns them on, and let their imagination run wild. Because it’s just them, listening to me in their headphones, erotic audio feels an intimate experience.  Women feel relaxed in their own bedrooms, a safe place to get aroused. Unlike traditional porn, women don’t compare how they look or ‘perform’ when using it. Of course, I can get turned on when making the stories. It would be a bad signI didn’t. I’m told I have a nice voice, which is funny because as a kid growing up in Dorset I sounded like Worzel Gummidge. Looks-wise, I’m only a five out of ten, but I would describe myself as a generous lover, with a high libido. I don’t like my photo published because it spoils the illusion, and I’ve had problems with stalkers. One woman flew over from Canada, unprompted, saying I must sleep with her. Another threatened to harm my rescue dogsI didn’t have sex with her. Although I am single currently and get offered a lot sex, I’d never sleep with a client, it’s unprofessional. I have never been unfaithful, though girlfriends do get jealous of my career choice. After all, thousands of women a day are orgasming by listening to me, it’s normal to feel threatened by that.  When I am dating someone I will happily talk dirty to hershe wants me to – but not every night. I’m thinking about, writing and recording filthy stories all day. I don’t want to take my work to bed with me, too. My job is unusual, but I enjoy it immensely, it’s hugely rewarding and I’m always thinking of new ways to give women pleasure. What more could a man ask for  How does Devlin give you orgasms with his voice  ● Listeners should be alone, with around  mins of uninterrupted time to themselves, and are encouraged to lie in bed, ideally naked, and use headphones for the most intimate experience. ● Some women have powerful orgasms completely ‘hands-free,’ though others use the audio as a guided masturbation tool. Whatever works for you – the emphasis is it’s your body, and your subconscious will do what is perfect for you. ● Each story has a slowly built-up introduction to encourage listeners to fully relax. A simple story unfolds, using gently suggestive imagery . The language eventually becomes more sexually explicit.

The £ bill works out at £. a day – just p more than a large Big Mac meal in McDonald’s. The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms. The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.” But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.” Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune. Graeme Wetherell, , who moved to Horden aged ten, said: “Strangers from other parts of the country have moved here because it is so cheap.

Pascal Soriot told The Andrew Marr Show this morning that British people will get first access to the vaccine from autumn, despite concerns it will not be ready. The pharmaceutical firm, which is working with Oxford University, had previously said it has secured the first agreements for at least  million doses of the vaccine. But a leading member of the project told The Sundaythe lower transmission of Covid- in the community leaves the trial with only a  per cent chance of success. Askedpeople in Britain will be among the first to get the vaccine, Mr Soriot said: Yes, we have actually received an order from the British Government to supply  million doses of vaccine, and those will go to the British people. And thereaposs no doubt, starting in September, we will start delivering these doses of vaccine to the British Government for vaccination. Mr Soriot said the possibility of the vaccine being rolled out in autumn depended onan Oxford University trial worked before the transmission rate lowers further. He added: The vaccine has to work and thataposs one question, and the other question is, evenit works, we have to be able to demonstrate it. We have to run as fast as possible before the disease disappears so we can demonstrate that the vaccine is effective. Oxford Universityaposs Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began development on a vaccine in January, using a virus taken from chimpanzees. Following an initial phase of testing on  healthy volunteers between  and , the study is now set to progress to phases two and three, which involve increasing the testing to up to , people and expanding the age range of volunteers to include children and the elderly.  Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, said: We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of  years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study. And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment. We will also be including more study sites, in dferent parts of the country.  Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, saidthe virusaposs spread is too low, not enough of the volunteers will catch it and the trial will be unable to definitively saythe vaccine works. Itaposs a race against the virus disappearing, and against time, Professor Hill said. We said earlier in the year that there was an  per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by September. But at the moment, thereaposs a  per cent chance that we get no result at all. Weaposre in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while.

Lucille, a jewellery maker from Kedington, Suffolk, tested positive on April , shortly after John, a key worker in a food factory, showed symptoms. And she is appalled at Mr Cummings’ behaviour. Lucille said: “For some, this will be a perfect excuse to break the rules. It was irresponsible in terms of the message it sends and the risk he posed to his own parents.  “It’s hard when you’re both ill but there was a strong possibility his little boy was going to also become ill, or had Covid but was asymptomatic.

I hope people don’t take this as a green light to go wherever they like, with whoever. It’s frightening how detached people have become from infection and death figures.

Professor Adrian Hill, whose team at Oxford University are racing to develop a jab, had originally hoped their efforts would be proved successful by September. But the researchers have suffered a setback because as coronavirus infections plummet in the UK, they cannot be sure their inoculation works, thereports. The Oxford vaccine is one of eight around the world and just one in the UK which is currently being tested in humans. Earlier in the year, scientists said they were % confident it would be proved effective by the autumn, making it one of the most promising candidates in the world. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It is widely believed that a vaccine is the only long-term way to stamp out Covid- and allow lockdown measures to be fully lted. However,the virus is not spreading in the community, volunteers who have had the jab cannot catch it and scientists will not knowthey have immunity. More than , people - including over s and --year-olds - have been enrolled in the second phase of the trial. However, as the UK emerges from the peak of its coronavirus epidemic, Prof Hill says he now expects just  of these volunteers to catch it. If fewer than  test positive, the results will be of limited use.“We’re in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining, Prof Hill told the . Tipped to be a aposfront runnerapos in the fight against Covid-, the UK government has pinned their hopes on the Oxford project, and has already agreed to pay for up to  million doses.

Earlier this week, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a .bn deal with the US government to produce an additional  million doses. The team is now looking to move its trials to coronavirus hotspots overseas, where the deadly bug is still spreading. “The US government, the UK government, loads of charities and philanthropists are all saying we’ll pay to have it manufactured, before you finish the trial. I mean, itaposs a huge kind of vote of confidence in what weaposre doing. Itaposs really flattering,” Prof Hill continued. “But that doesnapost guarantee the result.

A chilly and blustery start to the weekend on Saturday is to make way for a warmer day today, with temperatures soaring still further to C on Monday. Many beaches across England stayed largely empty on Saturday as the weather helped keep people away amid warnings not to break coronavirus rules over the bank holiday weekend. Authorities feared crowds would flock to popular coastal destinations following similar incidents in the past week, but beauty spots in Brighton and Cornwall were quiet thanks to strong winds and rain showers. But the mercury is expected to rise to Cin London on Monday, with coastal areas likely to see the temperature hit C- and councils have warned people not to take advantage of the warmer weather. Saturday was predicted to be the colder day, before a pleasant Sunday, with warnings to the public remaining in place. Beach-goer, Jane Grfiths, retired, from Newquay, said her local area was more quiet on Saturday than usual for the time of year, as mph winds swept the area She said: A few people were dotted about and a few people were surfing. On normal May bank holidays, the beaches would have been packed and leguards would have had red flags flying today. Although breezy today, visitors would have used wind breaks.We saw a few people but nothing like the numbers we would normally have seen. Elsewhere in Brighton, the mercury rose to just Cin the morning, and as heavy showers arrived in the afternoon, pictures showed the seafront was largely empty. It was also a blustery day for other coastal areas in the South East, including Margate, in Kent, and Southend in Essex, which was busy earlier in the week. But Saturdayaposs gales and lower temperatures left beaches and open spaces empty for most of the day. In the North West, the usually popular Blackpool hit a maximum temperature of C , with some strong gales of up to mph. Pictures on social media showed an empty area surrounding the Blackpool Tower tourist attraction on the seafront. But the warnings from councils to stay away remain the same ahead of sunny spells expected to arrive for parts of the UK on Sunday.  Sefton Council in Merseyside has adopted a new campaign ahead of the bank holiday weekend, telling people Wish you werenapost here!. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no leguard cover and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. Devon County Council asked people to think twice about visiting the coast and to considerthey could remain closer to home.

Though  widows are more likely to be spotted outside, they also like to hide under toilets, fridges and washing machines, Wales Online reports. Some residents have already spotted the species in their homes. Rachael Davies, , from Pontardawe, Wales recent came across one in her home and had to call her dad in order to get rid of it. I was clearing out the conservatory and the spider was just cwtched in the corner. I didnapost like the look of it, she said. My husband was in work, so I did what I always do when I see a spider, called my dad.  He only lives on the next street over, we followed social distancing guidelines of course. He brought gloves as he had a suspicion from my description that it was possibly a  widow.  He managed to catch it in a spider catcher and released it in the woods at the top of our road. The spiders have been known to bite people and gained a fearsome reputation in  after decorator Ricki Whitmore almost lost his leg as a result of being bitten. The dad-of-three, from Essex, discovered a nest of spiders - which were large and purplish brown with white markings on their backs - while renovating a school. As he tried to sweep the creatures away, they scuttled towards him before one jumped and sank itaposs fangs into his thigh as he tried to brush it off. After being rushed to Queenaposs Hospital in Romford, staff told Ricki that his leg was filled with poison and may need to be amputated. Thankfully it didnapost come to that, although he had to undergo specialist physiotherapy to be able to walk again. Danielle Galvin, , from Neath was bitten by a  widow spider while she slept around five years ago. She developed a large blister on her leg and described the sensation as intense itching similar to a regular insect bite, but hot to the touch and much worse. Miss Galvin said she still has scarring today.  A spokesperson for the British Arachnological Societysaid: We have had a huge increase in sightings of all species associated with the house and garden. False widows are a small proportion of current incoming records but we already know that the species are very widespread and well established across the southern half of Britain. The overall increase is undoubtedly a direct result of the lockdown. Many more people are at home and making the best of enjoying the company of their local wildle.We can quanty our increase in traffic on Twitter but not the change in numbers of records for dferent species via this route.Virtually everyone asking us about  widows is reassured to have factual information, and most think the spiders themselves are beautul.

The countryaposs herd immunity strategy was championed by Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. He recommended adopting voluntary measures against the virus, rather than a mandatory lockdown like those imposed by many other countries, which has ided opinion at home and abroad. Sweden has kept most schools, restaurants, bars and businesses open even as much of Europe hunkered down behind closed doors.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirrorThe policy has exposed it to criticism with death rates running far higher than in Nordic neighbours, evenmuch lower than in countries such as Britain, Italy and France that shut down. The number of Covid- patients in intensive care in Sweden has fallen by a third from the peak in late April and health authorities say the outbreak is slowing. However, Sweden recorded the highest number of Covid- deaths per capita in Europe over a seven day period. The antibody study aimed to find out whether herd immunity was achievable.  If it is, enough people in the population would have developed immunity to the infectious disease to be able to effectively stop it from spreading. The findings were roughly in line with models predicting a third of the Swedish capital’s population would have had the virus by now and where at least limited herd immunity could have set in, the Swedish Health Agency said on Wednesday. “It is a little bit lowerbut not remarkably lower, maybe one or a couple of percent,” Tegnell told a Stockholm news conference. “It squares pretty well with the models we have.” However, the herd immunity concept is untested for the novel coronavirus and the extent and duration of immunity among recovered patients is equally uncertain as well.  The study drew on some , tests from across the country although only figures for Stockholm were released. Unlike the other Nordic countries, Swedenaposs government has not enforced widespread lockdown measures. Basing its approach on a so-called aposprinciple of responsibilityapos, the country has not only kept schools open, but they remain compulsory for children under  to attend. Cafes, bars and restaurants have also stayed open for business, albeit with social distancing measures enforced.  The government has urged people to work from home where possible, while not mandating that anyone does so. While Swedenaposs Health Agency officials have stressed herd immunity is not a goal in itself, it has also said the strategy is only to slow the virus enough for health services to cope, not suppress it altogether. The World Health Organization has warned against pinning hopes on herd immunity.

The North Korean leader was rumoured to be gravely ill or even dead last month after he missed an important anniversary event. But he reappeared at a fertiliser factory, and has now been pictured chairing a meeting about the countryaposs nuclear capabilities. The meeting of the ruling Workersapos Partyaposs powerful Central Military Commission marked Kimaposs first public appearance in three weeks The military meeting to discuss new policies to bolster the countryaposs nuclear capabilities amid stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, state media KCNA said on Sunday. He made an unusually small number of outings in the past two months amid coronavirus concerns. North Korea has imposed strict anti-coronavirus measures although it says it has no confirmed cases.  And pictures from the event appear to show those at the meeting sitting relatively close together - not two metres apart under social distancing guidelines widely adopted where in the world. Speculation had erupted about Kimaposs wellbeing after the despot missed an annual birthday celebration for his late grandfather - Kim Il-sung, the countryaposs founder - on April . Taiwanaposs National Security Bureaudirector-general Chiu Kuo-cheng reporting last week the leader was sick and contingency plans were in placehe were to die.US-led negotiations aimed at dismantling North Koreaaposs nuclear and missile programmes have made little progress since late last year, especially after a global battle on coronavirus began. The meeting discussed measures to bolster armed forces and reliably contain the persistent big or small military threats from the hostile forces, KCNA said.

It was great.“I remember being in Dens and just crossing the street and after one minute we were at the Dundee United stadium. That was the most strange thing.“I have played in a lot of derbies, Boca Juniors-River Plate, after that Rangers-Celtic, I played against Lazio when I was at Roma so I can say I have played great games with two teams who hate each other. It was great for the people.“I knew the fans would feel it a lot to win against United. I know the feeling of winning a derby.“With my team-mates we celebrated with the fans and it was great. I had won derbies in my career and that was another one – I wanted to win that game because I knew how signicant it is for the fans.”He added: “It was a great experience, one I liked a lot and I’m not just saying that. I liked my time a lot in Scotland.“I didn’t know anything about Dundee when Bonetti called me but I said ‘let’s go and don’t think about that’. The people were great.“I remember the first game against Aberdeen, coming on in the second half. I was kicked by a defender who got a red card – I had to jump otherwise he would have broken my legs!“I liked the way of playing football in Scotland, I liked the dynamic of the game.“You could never say you had won a gameyou were winning - with five minutes to go. In Italy, you are winning - or - and no one wants to go forward so I liked that a lot.”Caniggia’s ability and manner on the pitch quickly endeared him to the Dundee support with many sporting long, blonde wigs as a tribute.“I remember the guys with the wigs, it was very funny. I like the people in Scotland a lot, very funny, easy going people and with a lot of pride.“Dens was a small stadium but I liked it a lot and the people at the club were great.“We had good players. I remember Gavin Rae, Barry Smith, Georgi Nemsadze – we had a few good players.

Therefore, don’t do it for those reasons.”Nicola SturgeonMs Sturgeon added that she was “desperate” to see her own parents, but the “last thing” she wanted to do was put them at risk.“I’m desperate to see my parents, like everybody , but the last thing I want to do – and I know others feel the same here – is put my parents at risk by inadvertently potentially passing them the virus,# she said.The first minister was confident people would exercise good judgement.  “It’s not me sayingyour parents live in Inverness don’t go because I’m telling you not to go,” she said. “It is about sayingyour parents live in Inverness and your parents live in Glasgow then what it will require for you to practically visit them might be putting your parents at risk. Therefore, don’t do it for those reasons.”As Scotland gradually comes out of the lockdown, Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said police would not be stopping motorists to ask them where they were going to ensure they were abiding by the rules. Chief Constable Livingstone said road checks would be counterproductive and intrusive.Ms Sturgeon also said Scotland could need more than the , contact tracers being recruited to implement her test, trace and isolate strategy.She said the Scottish Government is “on track” to have , contact tracers in place by June.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on the what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey through to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves area favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, threadlike leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, then you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general wellbeing is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.

concrete steps on the journey back to normality.ldquoAs Irsquove said before, it wonrsquot be normality as we knew it because the virus will not have gone away, but it will be a journey to a better

two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

of litter that have been left lying around, often when proper bins arenrsquot that far away, said Nixon.ldquoI thought it would be a good idea for Selkirk players to take a bin bag with them when they head out to take their daily exercise, picking up any litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said: ldquoItrsquos another way the club can put something back into the local community, though this time therersquos no sponsorship involved.ldquoItrsquos looking asitrsquos going to be a wee while before any rugby is going to be played, so this latest effort not only helps keep the players in touch with each other, itrsquos also providing a useful service for the Selkirk community.Meanwhile, Selkirk Rugby Club is to stage its annual Players Presentation Night on Fridayndash although this yearrsquos event will be a lsquovirtualrsquo get-together.The plan is for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely as possible to the format normally used at the clubrsquos annual presentation nights, said Wight.ldquoA total of nine trophies are up for grabs, and the name of each award winner will be announced separately on the video link, followed by film footage, or photos, of that player in a match situation.ldquoShort addresses will be given by, among others, the clubrsquos chairman and its director of rugby, as well as recaps of the st and lsquoArsquo XVsrsquo seasons by the sidesrsquo respective team managers.\"It should be a fun

senior adviser ldquoacted responsibly, legally and with integrity, there remain questions about Mr Cummingrsquos decision to make the initial journey, along with the further allegations levelled against the -year-old.ndash Why did he need to go  miles north The argument pushed by Number  is that Mr Cummings, fearing there would be no one to look after his four-year-old sonhe and his we became ill with coronavirus at the same time, travelled to be near his family in County Durham to seek childcare.Yet Labour shadow policing minister Sarah Jones said, in an interview on Sky Newsrsquo Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, she knew of ldquosingle mothers who have had Covid-, when their child has had to stay with them and neighbours and volunteers had to ldquochip-in food so they can eat.Given the sacrices made by others, critics have queried why Mr Cummings, as someone involved in setting the lockdown rules, could not call on any friends or family in London to assist them in adhering to the restrictions.ndash Did he have Covid- when travelling The PM tested positive for coronavirus on March  and Number  confirmed that Mr Cummings developed symptoms over the weekend of March -.He was

Grant Shapps was asked during the Sunday morning media round about whether the family took a pit stop, but said he did not know the answer.But he argued Mr Cummings was a ldquostickler for

eyewitness ndash Robin Lees, a -year-old former teacher ndash saw Mr Cummings with his we and child at Barnard Castle, a popular tourist spot  miles from Durham, on April .Downing Street has not specically addressed this allegation, but Mr Shapps suggested the Easter Sunday outing,it took place, ldquowould have been outside the -day period for self-isolation.Government advice is that anyone suffering from coronavirus symptoms must quarantine for seven days after contracting the virus.And guidance issued by the National Police Chiefsrsquo Counciland the College of Policing in early April advised officers not to punish people for using their cars to drive ldquoa reasonable distance for exercise.ndash Why is the PM standing by him Mr Johnson said he thought his aide acted in the best interests of his child, acting in a way ldquoany parent would frankly understand.But Tory MPs have questioned the Conservative leaderrsquos judgment in backing him, complaining they remain ldquounconvinced by the PMrsquos defence.Former minister Paul Maynard said Mr Cummingsrsquo case seemed ldquoutterly indefensible.It is a classic case of do as I say, not as I do ndash and it is not

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent.

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others.

Restaurant insiders and analysts fear that we could lose half of our restaurants to the lockdown.Just imagine the effect this would have on our cityscapes. Think of all the people whorsquod lose their jobs ndash chefs, front-of-house staff, suppliers ndash all the businesses that would be forced to stop trading, tragic economic casualties of coronavirus.Michelin-starred chef Marcus Wareing recently warned that the UK restaurant industry, which is worth pound billion per year, and which employs hundreds of thousands of workers, could collapse.As one top Scottish chef told me, the effects of coronavirus have been ldquobrutal. ldquoEvery week wersquore in a bigger hole.

For restaurateurs, these are emergency responses, not long-term solutions.As for diners, well for me at least, a takeaway is a poor substitute for a restaurant visit.Letrsquos hope that our restaurants can stagger through until lockdown ends, understanding landlords and banks allowing.In the meantime, we must have an urgent conversation about how they might reopen their doors sooner rather than later. On the upside, the YouGov poll, carried at the peak of coronavirus infection and public anxiety, shows that  per cent of us would consider eating out.But on what terms might that be  Here, I share the sentiments of UK restaurant legend Jeremy King, of Wolseley fame, who recently said: ldquoI certainly have no interest in going to a place where I am sitting in isolation, surrounded by Perspex screens and served by someone in a mask and gloves. Wherersquos the fun in that Some form of social distancing must be put in placecustomers are going to . Just how much though If the UK and Scottish governments insist on the scientically baseless two-metre rule, that would spell the demise of most restaurants.The requirement is impractical: most chefs work about one metre apart. And restaurants operate on tight margins, so a severe reduction in the number of covers they can accept would mean that they were losing money hand over fist.The WHO recommends a more reasonable one-metre measure. Already Sweden, Italy, France, Norway, Denmark, Austria, and New Zealand have ruled that one metre distancing between tables is sufficient.People who decide to be lsquolockdown lersrsquo may never eat out again. No restaurant can ever guarantee them absolute safety from this virus.But many of us who love eating out will be prepared to live with that risk and support restaurants when they reopen , that is, our governments give them the chance."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  welcome downpours and new life","story":"Alan takes a particular interest in a beech sapling we were given by a neighbour, whose own magnicent spreading copper beech had seeded in her flowerbed.

Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart.

They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green.

He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-neil-mackay-welcome-covids-new-world-order","story":"WITH little fanfare and certainly no shots fired, the island of Ireland took a historic step towards unication a few days ago.Thanks to coronavirus there will be no demonstrations in Belfast, no rioting or rabble-rousing. Politicians are too busy tackling the outbreak to squabble over the constitution and ramp up ision. Beneath the fog of pandemic, a very signicant sht has occurred in the geopolitical order, and no-one is taking that much notice.The British Government confirmed on Wednesday that there will now be checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK as part of Brexit. That effectively puts the border by the Irish Sea, at ports like Belfast ndash and therefore between Ulster and mainland Britain, not Ulster and Ireland. The whole of the UK will leave the customs union, but Northern Ireland will continue to enforce EU regulations at ports ndash just as the Republic does. Border posts will be built at Ulster ports.The republican dream of a united Ireland has come one step nearer. At any other time than during pandemic, such moves would have caused a constitutional crisis. There would be fears of violence. Security would increase. Ulster politicians would have been on their soapboxes. But within a day of the announcement, it was all but forgotten.This sht in Irish affairs is just one of myriad ways coronavirus is changing the world order. It is reshaping geopolitics as it changes societies, governments, and people around the globe. You could say wersquore entering the age of Covidrsquos New World Order.From one perspective, the virus has brutally undermined Brexit, its nostalgic appeal to supporters, and its harking back to some form of th-century Splendid Isolation ndash when the Victorian empire stood alone on the worldrsquos stage.Whether a Leaver or Remainer, itrsquos hard not to see Britainrsquos move away from the EU as anything other than a lonely prospect in light of Covid. The UK has the highest total deaths in Europe. Britainrsquos capabilities to deal with the infection ndash from testing and tracing to care homes and PPE ndash have been found wanting, while nations like Germany handled the crisis much more effectively. Can a tiny island really go it alone at a time of global crisis  Donrsquot we need our neighbours more than ever Or could coronavirus confirm for some that the drawbridge should remain pulled up  The pandemic is already stirring a toxic stew of racism, immigration, and border controls. In a world of closed borders, reduced travel and fear of infection, might the hard-right vision of Brexit broaden its appeal  There are already fears in a number of countries that coronavirus is a gt to extremists, and nationalism is on the rise across the world.Here in Scotland, coronavirus has inserted itself into the DNA of the debate about the union. How will the pandemic play out when it comes to Scottish independence  In the wake of the virus, will Scotland going it alone be seen as absurd as Brexit  Or will the growing ndash yet in truth still quite insignicant ndash ergence between the UK and Scottish governments on the handling of coronavirus make the fires of independence burn stronger  Beyond the presentational skills of the First Minister and the Prime Minister, however, therersquos not really that great a dference in the way Holyrood and Westminster have dealt with the outbreak.Unlike Brexit, though, Scottish independence isnrsquot a done deal. So, will people have the stomach for more constitutional chaos once normality s  Amid the coming global economic meltdown ndash set to rival the Great Crash of  ndash how many voters will want to risk more financial jeopardy with separation from the UK  Public mood matters.The Yes movement tilts strongly towards Europe. However, even the most staunch European is starting to feel uneasy about the EUrsquos behaviour amid coronavirus. Therersquos a real risk the European project could unravelmember states emerge from the outbreak unevenly ndashthe rich north prospers and the poor south suffers. There are east-west tensions too. Restricting aid to weak states could lead to the EU tearing itself apart.Former Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni is now the EUrsquos economy commissioner. He has warned about the pandemic causing economic ision and threatening stability and unity. Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia are facing falls in GDP of above %, while Germany looks to be facing a squeeze of about . and Austria .. Memories of Germanyrsquos treatment of Greece after the  financial crash remain raw.ldquoWhat is clear is the uneven level of the recovery and the risks this creates to our single market, Gentiloni said, adding: ldquoThis is something that I could even define as an existential threat to the building of the Union.However, the reverse is also true. If the EU can manage recovery fairly and pull together it will emerge stronger, and that could be the making of Europe ndash cementing its place as a world superpower. More integration in Europe, not less, would pave the way to an equal playing field for all member states.The UN secretary general, Antoacutenio Guterres, has said: ldquoThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysal. Covid- is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.The big issue haunting European recovery is how it is paid for ndash loans or grants  France, Spain and Italy favour grants, Germany and the Netherlands back loans. Gentiloni has said grants represent ldquothe principle of solidarity. Loans will make poorer countries poorer. If that happens, Brexit ndash which most Europeans see as madness ndash may look less crazy. The Dutch have already been told by Spain that ldquoa first-class cabin would not protect you when the ship sinks.Self-evidently, both emotionally and psychologically, the pandemic undermines the European ideal. Nations are coping with the outbreak as they see fit, not how Brussels deems. Borders have been strengthened. All this plays into the populist agenda of politicians like Italyrsquos Matteo Salvini, whose anti-EU rhetoric is gathering traction ndash one recent poll showed % of Italians want to quit the EU.The EU has also failed to rein in the authoritarian Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has used coronavirus to undermine democracy, silence opposition and smother the press. If the EU, which was built to extend democracy across the continent, cannot control a man like Orban, then what does it stand for Europe is the standard-bearer of globalisation, but globalisationrsquos reputation has been shredded in recent years, thanks to the financial crash and the rise of right-wing nationalism around the world from America First Trumpism to Brazil, India and the Philippines. Covid has put globalism in intensive care.For a quick example of Covidrsquos contraction of global commerce, trade and movement look to Heathrow, one of the worldrsquos busiest airports. Passenger numbers have dropped by %. World trade in goods could shrink by up to % this year.The global supply chain has been fractured ndash goods made on one side of the planet are taking longer to reach the other side. Will autarky ndash national self-sufficiency ndash be the next big buzzword when it comes to the direction the planet takes  People across the world ndash especially here at home ndash are asking why their governments didnrsquot have stockpiles of protective gear, why there werenrsquot enough ventilators, why it took so long to get testing supplies  Covid could create a groundswell of opinion which sees electorates favouring nation states looking after themselves, while turning their backs on international co-operation.Trade and travel bring down borders ndash at least in the mind. But with trade and travel in deep freeze, the worldrsquos mood music could change drastically. As economic pain bites through the recovery period, therersquos likely to be a wholesale reappraisal of international aid in many countries. Indiarsquos populist leader Narendra Modi says a new era of economic self-reliance has already started. Japan will subsidise firms that bring their factories back home as part of its recovery package. The EU has talked of ldquostrategic autonomy.Globalisation has as many curses as it does blessings ndash but one thingrsquos sure, coronavirus proves that the world must pull together at a time of crisis, not apart. A vaccine will one day be found by scientists from many countries working in unity. No country can stand alone against global threats.Countries that have tried to go it alone during Covid have come out worse. Sweden, which took its own slack and eccentric approach to preventative measures, now has the highest per-capita death rate on the planet. This in itself shakes one of the old world orderrsquos received wisdoms: the guarantee that Scandinavian countries will always get things right. On the flip side, other small nations seem to be proving that big is not necessarily best. The countries which have most prevailed are states like New Zealand and South Korea.And then therersquos America. Itrsquos still the worldrsquos superpower, but in name only. The Trump administrationrsquos handling of coronavirus has been risible and dangerous ndash from the president suggesting people inject bleach and his rabble-rousing press conferences, to the countryrsquos escalating death toll and paramilitary-style anti-lockdown demos. In general, populist administrations like Trumprsquos have done badly during the pandemic ndash particularly Brazilrsquos president Jair Bolsonaro, who is ruling over chaos.The idea that the US still provides global leadership was on the skids long before Covid arrived, but the pandemic has killed off any notion that America remains the worldrsquos policeman. When Trump turned on the World Health Organisation over coronavirus, it illustrated not only American withdrawal from the world, but also the fragility of international organisations and the waning of globalisation as a political philosophy.America also shows how, in this age of political polarisation, Covid can force even deeper wedges between a population. By and large, Trumprsquos nativist base wants protective measures to end, while Democrats take a more cautious European approach. These isions have already turned ugly with armed protesters entering Michiganrsquos state capitol as legislators debated coronavirus emergency powers.As Americarsquos role as global leader evaporates, China waits in the wings to step forward as the dominant world power. When coronavirus emerged, there was speculation that Beijingrsquos handling of the outbreak was so bad the Communist Party might fall. Today, therersquos no chance of that ndash the nation is recovering, and has been seen to handle the crisis relatively well. It is now aggressively fighting back against attacks by Trump and his supporters that China was to blame for the outbreak and the extent of global deaths.China seemed to reflect all the competing tensions in the world relating to coronavirus ndash the role of America, the trouble in Europe, the future place of Beijing in the world ndash when it promised to send tonnes of medical equipment to Italy, at a time when Western states were failing to help. China also sent medical teams to Iran and supplies to Serbia whose president dismissed claims of European solidarity as a fairy tale, saying ldquothe only country that can help us is China.That vignette should send a chill down the spine of anyone who believes in democracy. If nations like Italy need China to bail them out then democracy is in trouble ndash it has been eroded at home, and undermined abroad. While Beijing embarks on this PR campaign for dictatorship, it is using Covid as a cover to crush dissent in Hong Kong.The poor performance by both the British and American administrations shows that the previous dominant dynamic in world affairs ndash US action backed by British support ndash is now a thing of the past.Russia and its place in the world could also face great change thanks to Covid. Without doubt, the Kremlin is lying about the number of Russian dead. Putinrsquos regime is Soviet when it comes to truth ndash facts are what the government says they are. However, death changes a lot, and Putinrsquos ratings have now fallen to a historic low. Could coronavirus result in a post-Putin era  Or a reboot of glasnost ndash the spirit of openness which helped bring down Communism  Putinrsquos iron grip on power makes it unlikely, but even in Russia we see Covid warping the political landscape.The Middle East is also starting to realign. After Saudi Arabia wounded the US fracking industry by flooding the world with cheap oil during this financially crippling pandemic, Trump, with his eyes fixed firmly on the stock market, took action. He withdrew air defence batteries, there to protect the kingdom from Iran, and pulled back troops, navy and fighter jets. The US-Saudi relationship was, until now, immutable. But thatrsquos no longer true thanks to Covid ndash and the fact that oil prices are so low they donrsquot justy a US military presence to protect petroleum states like Saudi. US officials have even said that Iran no longer poses a threat to American strategic interests in the Gulf. Barely noticed, this is one of the greatest seismic shts in geopolitics wrought by coronavirus.Simultaneously, Iran is starting to withdraw some of its military from Syria where it has been backing the Assad regime. In turn, this reduces tensions with Israel in the region. The sands are shting in the Middle East because of coronavirus, just as they are across the entire planet.As Francersquos president Emmanuel Macron predicts of the outbreak: ldquoThis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be ato the day before.Coronavirus has already warped the political world, and wersquore still just a few months into the pandemic. Much change lies ahead ndash whether that change is good or bad lies in all our hands."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

But it highlights going green as part of a recovery that would cut carbon emissions and create jobs, while including support for investment in clean industry and transport, making buildings net-zero, carbon capture and storage.The plan would also seek to take better advantage of Scotlandrsquos green energy revolution, which the Herald revealed was increasingly being placed in the hands of overseas firms.Camleys Cartoon: Green energy jobs.In Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see a new Future Jobs Fund to back a construction and \"deep\" retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating \"good quality\" jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills.In , in the wake of a financial crisis which resulted in the bailout of banks the threat of high youth unemployment loomed, and the government created the Future Jobs Fund, which paid employers a wage subsidy to take on young people.The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.An upgrade to our existing housing stock to be become energy-efficient means improving the fabric of the buildings.STUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said that capital investment should go into a \"better regulated\" construction sector and \"serious consideration\" given to the creation of a Scottish National Construction company.\"Scotlandrsquos housing stock, with a high proportion of tenement properties, is not the easiest to retrofit with energy saving measures such as insulation and new heating systems, however progress on deep retrofit has been identied as one of the key elements in achieving net zero,\" he said.\"There has also been a tendency to shallow retrofit building meaning that one emissions saving measure is introduced with other adaptations undertaken later on or not at all. This crisis and the need to plan better and create jobs provides an ideal opportunity establish a programme of deep-retrofit, nationally co-ordinated and locally delivered.\"It is analogous to the massive effort in the early s when the UK converted millions of gas boilers to be offshore gas compliant, creating thousands upon thousands of jobs and massively boosting the economy. Such a programme is best driven by state investment and delivered through nationally co-ordinated or even a nationalised construction company. As well as providing a much needed boost for jobs and apprenticeships it would have a serious and positive impact on fuel poverty.\"The Coalition for the Energy Efficiency of Buildingsargues that such a retrofit programme would slash emissions, create jobs and could reboot a battered post-Covid economy.The CEEB, which is backed by the UK government and the City of London Corporation, argues that such an approach would support more than , skilled and semi-skilled construction jobs, provide a quick economic stimulus and boost consumer spending through energy cost savings.Mr Moxham said lessons can be learned from the collapse of construction giant Carillion two years ago which cost UK taxpayers an estimated poundm.When it was liquidated with debts of pound.bn, the firm had about  UK public sector contracts.\"The collapse provided evidence of how an massive under-regulated private sector companies can fail with all real risk transferred to workers and the public sector,\" he said.\"A publicly owned construction company could guarantee better and less precarious employment practices twinned with a co-ordinated approach to green construction and retrofitting.\"Undertaking such actions requires investment and increases government indebtedness, however the nature of such government borrowing is that it is borrowing against its own future. \"Thus a green Future Jobs Fund would see a massive expansion in the training of and provision of good jobs for young people. Taken in conjunction with overall economic boost it would provide one of the most effective ways to borrow to invest.\"In , a Scottish Government report stated the offshore wind sector alone offered the potential for , direct jobs and a further , jobs in related industries, as well as pound.bn investment in Scotland by .The Scottish Governmentrsquos low carbon strategydescribed the large scale development of offshore wind as representing the ldquobiggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation with Scotland having an estimated % of Europersquos offshore wind potential.But in February, it emerged that it had in fact created just sixper cent of the , direct jobs predicted. Official estimates stated that there were just , full-time jobs in the offshore wind sector in Scotland, a fraction of the numbers projected by .Mr Moxham said: \"Thus far the then First Minister Alex Salmonds comments that Scotland would become the lsquoSaudi Arabiarsquo of renewables has failed to materialise.\"He said there should be \"much stricter conditionality\" attached to contracts for renewable construction in Scotland to \"ensure a radical improvement\" in the number of local supply chain jobs in offshore and other renewables.\"It is essential that we offer meaningful and well-paid employment for those likely to suffer from the current and longer-term downturn in offshore oil and gas,\" he said.His views come as the TUC called for the government to form a National Recovery Council to help the economy heal from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.It said lessons can be learned from former prime minister Clement Attleersquos  government, which inherited massive wartime debts but saw them slide rapidly as the economy recovered.The Labour administration launched the NHS, a welfare safety net and mass housebuilding, nationalised industries and sought to boost demand to maintain full employment.d on short-term crisis management and wary about the rising costs of existing crisis measures.TUC analysis showed that the decade of investment for growth between  and  that followed World War II achieved an average growth rate of . per cent. But the decade of cuts between  and  that followed the bankersrsquo crisis achieved average growth of just . per cent.The National Recovery Council would be made up of representatives from government, unions and employers, with regional and devolved nation recovery  also feeding into the planning and delivery of recovery strategies.The state should also consider a ldquofunded inidual learning account for jobless people to learn new skills, ideally with the promise of a job at the end of training."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus---now-two-thirds-scots-support-universal-basic-income-poll-finds","story":"TWO thirds of Scots support the introduction of universal basic income, according to a new poll.Research and consultancy firm Mark Dfley asked more than  peoplethey supported or opposed the idea of a basic payment with % agreeing it should be introduced in Scotland.It comes after the First Minister said earlier this month that discussions around universal basic incomebetween Holyrood and Westminster should be a top priority.Nicola Sturgeon said that the coronavirus pandemic and the economic damage caused by it \"have actually made me much, much more strongly of the view that it is an idea thats time has come\".Under the scheme, residents would be given a payment from the government regardless of whether they were working or not, and some benefits would be scrapped.In  the Scottish Government introduced four pilots in Glasgow, Fe, Edinburgh and North Ayrshire to determinethe measures were feasible, and a final report on the outcome is due to be published next month.The latest survey was designed by Mark Dfley, conducted using online  Scotpulse and commissioned by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commercecharity.The RSA has previously argued that a basic annual income of pound, for adults and pound for children could eradicate extreme poverty in Scotland, however critics say it could encourage people to be irresponsible or lazy.According to the study conducted in March with , people, more women agreed with the idea than men while more east coast residents supported it than those living in the west or north of the country.They were asked: \"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, some people have repeated calls for what is known as a lsquoUniversal Basic Incomersquo to be introduced in Scotland.

In this age group % of people had no opinion either way and % didnt know what they thought about it.Jamie Cooke, head of the RSA, said that basic income \"offers the chance to respond to the current crisis\" and \"create a new foundation for a reinvigorated social contract for the future\".Mark Dfley, founder of Mark Dfley Consultancy and Research, said: \"The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated interest in and discussion around the issue of Universal Basic Income.

But questions remain over whether universities will overhaul how they provide higher education and what the sector will continue to prioritise.The pro-vice-chancellor at Glasgow Caledonian University, Professor Cam Donaldson, has suggested that higher education institutions and industries that take on graduates should place more value on qualications for essential workers such as nurses ndash with the importance being reinforced with the role they are playing in the battle against coronavirus.Professor Donaldson has claimed that before the pandemic, ldquohigh value was attached to courses producing the biggest earners, amid a ldquocrude human capital approach over what is valuable in education.He said: ldquoWe see value resulting from investing in people as inidual units of production, much like investing in machinery and technology.ldquoIs this really how we view the value of education, whereby a lsquolow-valuersquo degree is one that fails to produce sufficient lsquo on investmentrsquo in terms of such earnings gained He added that ldquothe same might apply to so-called low-value degrees ndash say, in nursing compared to ldquohigher-value degrees in medicine.Donaldson said ldquothere are particular reasons why the price or wage for nurses is less than that for medical doctors, but surely that does not diminish either their value to society nor, therefore, the value of their degrees.He added: ldquoThe same logic applies to other degrees offered by universities, such as social work or for allied health professions, which may not pay as much as law or finance.ldquoOne of the many things laid bare by Covid- is that essential workers are not defined by what they earn ndash eventhey should actually be paid more.Universities have stressed that the industry will need to examine attitudes over what constitutes success and potentially overhaul how graduates are valued.Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said: ldquoIf the pandemic has told us anything itrsquos that we need to reprioritise what we value ndash salary is not a measure of a personrsquos worth or what they contribute.ldquoPolicy agendas that fixate on graduate salaries alone are always going to value the wrong thing and undercut a lot of real value added in our society and economy.\"Graduate nurses are a great example but there are many other graduate careers in the public and third sectors, in the creative industries and in start-up companies, which may not command high salaries but are integral to our society, fuel our economy and give expression of who we are as a country.He added: ldquoA degree offers graduates a letime salary premium but it also offers a set of highly transferrable skills which is often as in-demand from employers as the degree subject. Right now, thatrsquos where our economy and society gets added value from its graduate workforce ndash their self-direction, ability to adapt, problem-solve, to respond creatively to much-changed circumstances and,necessary, the ability to pivot careers entirely. That is not reducible into a simple -on-investment figure but it counts for so much.A body representing nurses in Scotland has stressed that the Covid- pandemic has illustrated even more clearly that salary should not be a benchmark of someonersquos value to society.Theresa Fyffe, director of the Royal College of Nursing Scotland, said: ldquoThe value of nursing staff has, in modern times, never been more apparent. The Covid- pandemic has demonstrated to politicians and the general public how important the skills, clinical expertise and professionalism of nursing staff is to our health and care system and the lives of people across Scotland.ldquoCam Donaldsonrsquos assessment that essential workers are not defined by what they earn has never been more evident. The RCN will make sure that no government forgets the professionalism demonstrated by all nursing staff during this pandemic and before it."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-comment-universities-need-rethink-values","story":"The value of university expertise seems to be on the rise again as we ldquofollow the science, and armies of nursing, medical and allied health students and staff have joined the fight against coronavirus. But, as with many other sectors of the economy, universities are set to struggle financially in a post-Covid- world.The stakes will be even higher than before the virus struck and we will inevitablyto questions of ldquovalue in higher education, about which there were active discussions pre-Covid-. Then the arguments were isive, as government thinking seemed to be focusing on a narrow conception of sector productivity. High value was attached to courses producing the biggest earners, and, although now hard to believe, influential reviews of the sector seemed to be following along, encouraging such a crude ldquohuman capital approach to determining value in education.Pre-virus, when much of this piece was conceived, my aim was to defend the so-called low-value against the high. Now, I would contend the case is even stronger.Such a human capital approach is one in which we see value resulting from investing in people as inidual units of production, much like investing in machinery and technology. The resulting productivity indicator is what education leads to in terms of salary attainment.Is this really how we view the value of education, whereby a ldquolow-value degree is one that fails to produce sufficient ldquo on investment in terms of such earnings Use of earnings as a measure of value falls into the same trap, challenged by several leading scholars, as using gross domestic productas a measure of the wellbeing of a nation.One is reminded here of the joke about economists knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing. In fact, economists are well aware of the dference between value and price .An example used to illustrate this in teaching economics is water versus diamonds the latter of which is priced at a much higher level than the former. However, this does not mean that diamonds have greater value than water the higher price for diamonds merely being due to the interaction between supply and demand. Diamonds are scarce and, so, even a small amount of demand will generate high prices. Water ndash at least here in Scotland ndash is not scarce, which means demand can be met at low prices. But the value generated by cheap water, over and above its price, is huge compared to that of diamonds.The same might apply to so-called low-value degrees ndash say, nursing ndash vis-agrave-vis higher-value degrees in medicine.There are particular reasons why the pricefor nurses is less than that for medical doctors, but surely that does not diminish either their value to society nor, therefore, the value of their degrees  The same logic applies to other degrees, such as social work or for allied health professions, which may not pay as much as law or finance.Where does the focus on earnings leave us in terms of lelong learning  Are we to disinvest from educating older people because their projected letime earnings willbe less than those of lesser years Many years ago, my own research area, health economics, abandoned such human-capital approaches to valuing the benefits of healthcare because of the negative connotations it had in terms of giving lower priority for treatment for older people and even dferent racial groups.What of gender too  Are we saying lower-earning degree courses dominated by women ndash and there are many out there ndash are of lesser value To some extent we focus on such measures of value in education because the data are there, falling into the trap of valuing what we can measure as opposed to measuring what we value. The latter poses challenges, but those with influence such as policymakers and universities themselves should not fall into lazy applications of lazy thinking.Finishing with some questions might point us in other more productive directions.What do we want ndash diamonds or water  Likely, it is a lot of the latter, but actually a wee bit of the other too.Why measure value in such simplistic and reductionist monetary terms  One of the many things laid bare by Covid- is that workers are not defined by what they earn ndash eventhey should actually be paid more.What of development goals , issued by the United Nations in and applying to all countries  A reasoned portfolio approach, of achievement across the SDGs, might be more challenging in terms of measurement and comparison, but rather that than chasing a will orsquo the wisp that earnings somehow represent value in education.Who knows, we might then end up with someone with a degree in classics running the country and guiding us through the coronavirus pandemic.Cam Donaldson is a renowned health economist, Yunus Chair and pro-vice-Chancellor Research at Glasgow Caledonian University"},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-review-glover---fifth-edition","story":"If yoursquore just beginning to learn about whisky, Irsquove got a wee bit of advice for you ... donrsquot believe the people who say only old whisky can be great whisky.Some of the best drams Irsquove ever tasted have been young ndash less that  years ndash with some real beauties less than five.The latest release of The Glover ndash a marriage of Scotch and Japanese single malt whiskies which has become the talk of the steamie in recent years ndash is the perfect case in point.This fth edition is a blend of Scotch from the Ardnamurchan Distillery and Japanese malt whisky from legendary Chichibu ... and both are only four years old.Each drams is highly acclaimed among whisky specialists in its own right despite its youth ndash and blending them together really does prove that old saying ldquoGreater than the sum of its parts.But before we get to tasting, what is The Glover  This bottle is the th in the series of pioneering blends from Fusion Whisky, which specialises in creating premium ldquofusions of Scotch and international whisky to commemorate a historical Scottish figure.The Glover itself celebrates the so-called ldquoScottish Samurai, Thomas Blake Glover, a merchant and diplomat who had a profound effect on Japan in the late th century.This fth edition is one of only , bottles, from first-fill bourbon barrels.

They understand the lasting damage this is doing to public confidence in the Tory Government and its Covid- response.\"The longer Mr Cummings stays in place, the more he will undermine the Tory Governments credibility and the more people will question the Prime Ministers judgement,\" added the Aberdeen MP.Meanwhile,Devi Sridhar, Professor of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, also called for Mr Cummings to resign.Speaking on the Sophy Ridge show, she said: \"He undermined the core public health message which was to stay home, to make sure that children are not left with elderly relatives and also going from an area that was ahead of the country - London - to an area that was a bit behind, north-east England.\"North-east England is now one of the hardest hit parts of the country. So, the clear thing is, yes, he needs to resign, but we also need to move on and bring focus to the key issues facing the UK.\"Prof Sridhar pointed out how the UK now hadclose to , excess deaths, one of the worst death rates per capita in the world.\"We dont have a good way out of this lockdown because there is no testing and tracing infrastructure to let us safely lt the lockdownand we have a lot of people suffering because of a lack of clear strategy of how we are going to move forward and get out of the deep hole that we are in,\" she added."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-murray-mp-condemns-lack-transparency-impact-nike-conference-revealed","story":"More than  employees from around the world attended the event at the Hilton Carlton Hotel on February  and .:Letters: Buck for the Nike silence must stop at the topInvestigations found that at least  people linked to the event contracted Covid-, including eight in Scotland, but the incident was not made public until it was revealed in a television documentary earlier this month.The first coronavirus case in Scotland was announced on March  and was a Tayside resident unrelated to the conference.But the Sunday Times says it has been reported locally that the North East of Englandrsquos ldquopatient zero attended the conference in February and the infection was passed to a second person in Newcastle at a childrsquos birthday party.The Chronicle newspaper also states that a church in Newcastle closed after a member tested positive for coronavirus, with it being ldquounderstood the patient works for Nike in Sunderland and contracted the virus after attending a conference in Edinburgh ndash although this was unconfirmed at the time.And in another report on Sunday, the Scottish Sun said one staff member at the Sunderland base contracted the virus after the Edinburgh conference.:Tom Gordon: The pretence of transparency is not what Scotland needsMr Murray, Labourrsquos only MP in Scotland, said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has fresh questions to answer about its cover-up of the ground-zero coronavirus outbreak.ldquoNot only were people in Edinburgh kept in the dark, the decision to keep the information secret means people in North East England were also unaware of how the virus could easily spread to their region.ldquoThere are questions too for the UK Government which should have acted when the Scottish Government failed to be transparent.ldquoThe lack of transparency from both governments is harming public confidence at a vital time for the country as we move towards the easing of lockdown measures.Mr Murray has previously accused Nicola Sturgeon of covering up the incident, something the First Minister has been strenuously forced to deny on several occasions.Elsewhere on Sunday, when asked about Dominic Cummingsrsquos reported journeys between London and Durham, Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge show that the North East of England ldquois now one of the hardest hit parts of the country.The first case in the area was reported on March  by Public Health England, three days after Scotlandrsquos first case.Microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington has also called for details of a report into the outbreak to be made public, as researchers would be ldquoworking in the dark without such information."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11405850.jpg?type=article-full","title":"led-donkeys-campaign-van-broadcasts-government-lockdown-advice-outside-dominic-cummings-house","story":"The stuntfrom Led By Donkeys, comes afterBoris Johnsonrsquos chief adviser travelled more than  miles during thecoronaviruslockdown to Durham in the northeast of England, to be near his family.Clip here.

Given the easing of restrictions in England they might have got away with it. Not so Gordon Brewer of Politics Scotland. He would have been nabbed on the M heading towards Carlisle.As it was, even Politics Scotland was caught up in what some papers were dubbing a ldquoDomnishambles.Brewerrsquos main guest was Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture.: Iain Macwhirter on Nicola Sturgeon capturing publics trustBefore he could get on to the pressing matter of how le in Scotland will change should the lockdown restrictions be eased on Thursday ndash a subject of such interest to the public here that the government website crashed within seconds of the First Ministerrsquos announcement last Thursday ndash he asked Ms Hyslop about the Cummings story. ldquoHe should resign, she said. Anda couple were in similar circumstances in Scotland  ldquoThey should stay at home.Elsewhere on the Sunday shows it was not quite that straightforward. Well, notyou were Grant Shapps, Englandrsquos Transport Secretary and designated Cummings lightning rod. Having performed in the latter role during Saturdayrsquos Downing Street press conference he was wheeled out to do the same on the Sunday shows.As on Saturday, all he wanted to talk about was progress on transport during the lockdown. So much good news about road repairs and track maintenance apparently. Alas, no-one wanted to know. All roads led to Durham and there was nothing Mr Shapps could do about it. As Ridge told him after he had a mini moan about the direction of questioning, ldquoIrsquom sure it is very disappointing not to be able to talk about the A as much as yoursquod like to on the programme.Ridge said the show had taken the ldquoreally unusual step the night before of flagging up the questions it wanted Mr Shapps to answer. Among these were: when did Mr Cummings first display symptoms did he stop on the journey when was the Prime Minister made aware, and so on.: End of the care home When Mr Shapps appeared, however, it was clear he had not done the homework requested. ldquoIrsquoll admit to being slightly disappointed that you donrsquot have the detail, said Ridge.There was another ldquodog ate my non-existent homework on Marr, when Mr Shapps revealed he had not spoken to Mr Cummings before coming on the show.ldquoIrsquove communicated, I havenrsquot spoken to him directly, said the Minister.ldquoWhy not  This is a very serious crisis for your government, surely you would have spoken to him ldquoI came on your programme as you know to talk about transport mattershellip.ldquoWersquoll get on to those, said Marr. Do you know, he never did.Both Ridge and Marr made sharp enquiries in the hope of getting some response from the Minister other than ldquodonrsquot knows and sentences beginning with ldquoItrsquos my understanding. Ridge asked: ldquoIs saving the job of Dominic Cummings really more important than getting people to adhere to the lockdown  Marr said the Government could keep Dominic Cummings or it could keep the policy intact, but it could not do both.Try as they did to get answers about Mr Cummingsrsquo initial trip and subsequent sightings, Mr Shapps blocked inquiries with the amiable bluster for which he is known. Final question from Marr was: ldquoIs he going to resign  Mr Shapps: ldquoNo.It was becoming clear that not every Tory MP, unlike Ministers the day before, was backing Mr Cummings. BBC Breakfast had been first with an interview with Steve Baker MP, who called for Mr Cummings to go. Ridge was then quick off the mark, rejigging the running order and getting Baker on as well.ldquoIf he doesnrsquot resign, wersquoll just keep burning through Borisrsquos political capital at a rate we can ill afford in the midst of this crisis, said the MP. ldquoIt is very clear that Dominic travelled when everybody  understood Dominicrsquos slogans to mean lsquostay at home, protect the NHS and save livesrsquo.Mr Baker said that with the PM due to appear before the Liaison Committee of MPs on Wednesday this would not be the end of the matter.From Sunday shows to Mr Johnson facing questions from a  of prominent politicians at pm on Wednesday.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

London to Durham during the lockdown.While the Prime Minister, speaking at the Downing Street press conference, said his most senior adviser ldquoacted responsibly, legally and with integrity, there remain questions about Mr Cummingrsquos decision to make the initial journey, along with the further allegations levelled against the -year-old.ndash Why did he need to go  miles north The argument pushed by Number  is that Mr Cummings, fearing there would be no one to look after his four-year-old sonhe and his we became ill with coronavirus at the same time, travelled to be near his family in County Durham to seek childcare.Yet Labour shadow policing minister Sarah Jones said, in an interview on Sky Newsrsquo Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, she knew of ldquosingle mothers who have had Covid-, when their child has had to stay with them and neighbours and volunteers had to ldquochip-in food so they can eat.Given the sacrices made by others, critics have queried why Mr Cummings, as someone involved in setting the lockdown rules, could not call on any friends or family in London to assist them in adhering to the restrictions.ndash Did he have Covid- when travelling The PM tested positive for coronavirus on March  and Number  confirmed that Mr Cummings developed symptoms over the weekend of March -.He was seen running out of Downing Street on March , shortly after it was confirmed publicly that Mr Johnson had the virus. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings began showing symptoms over the weekend of March -, No  said On Friday, a statement issued by Durham Constabulary suggested Mr Cummingsrsquo father had confirmed his son was self-isolating in the North East as of March .Given the average incubation period for Covid- is five days, but can be as long as , the four-day gap between the two dates suggests he could have been asymptotic while travelling.ndash Did he have to stop en route to Durham Driving  miles across the country with a four-year-old and a sick we in the car, who was already displaying Covid- symptoms, Mr Cummings might well have needed to stop for a break.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was asked during the Sunday morning media round about whether the family took a pit stop, but said he did not know the answer.But he argued Mr Cummings was a ldquostickler for social-distancing rules, indicating he would have abided by them during any stop-off. vw,vw,px, px\"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended Dominic Cummings over his lockdown travels on Sunday The Cabinet minister told Sophy Ridge: ldquoI saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart, so I know he is a stickler for those rules about what to do to make sure you are following the two-metre rule and the like, so Irsquom sure that they took all the necessary precautions.ndash Did he go on a day trip to Barnard Castle The Observer and Sunday Mirror reported that an eyewitness ndash Robin Lees, a -year-old former teacher ndash saw Mr Cummings with his we and child at Barnard Castle, a popular tourist spot  miles from Durham, on April .Downing Street has not specically addressed this allegation, but Mr Shapps suggested the Easter Sunday outing,it took place, ldquowould have been outside the -day period for self-isolation.Government advice is that anyone suffering from coronavirus symptoms must quarantine for seven days after contracting the virus.And guidance issued by the National Police Chiefsrsquo Counciland the College of Policing in early April advised officers not to punish people for using their cars to drive ldquoa reasonable distance for exercise.ndash Why is the PM standing by him Mr Johnson said he thought his aide acted in the best interests of his child, acting in a way ldquoany parent would frankly understand.But Tory MPs have questioned the Conservative leaderrsquos judgment in backing him, complaining they remain ldquounconvinced by the PMrsquos defence.Former minister Paul Maynard said Mr Cummingsrsquo case seemed ldquoutterly indefensible.It is a classic case of do as I say, not as I do ndash and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up.It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable.  mdash Paul Maynard MPMay , ndash Was his son cared for by family while in Durham Mr Cummingsrsquo defence for his actions, along with the PMrsquos justication for keeping him on, hinges on the belief he and his we could need childcarethey both became unwell.In No rsquos Saturday statement setting out what went on, it made no reference to his son being looked after by family members, only that Mr Cummingsrsquo sister ldquoshopped for the family and left everything outside their property, which is said to be adjacent to the family

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Many of them did not leave their garden.Some did not leave their house.It was of course a virtual collective walk or run. It was accomplished via the internet.An app called Strava recorded, mapped and collated each participant#s accomplishment and assembled them into a whole.The Celtic and Scotland footballer Ryan Christie, a Highlander who began his career at Inverness Caley Thistle, took part and posted a video message of support on Facebook and Twitter.#Skye is on the mind of every Highlander just now,# said Ryan from Glasgow.Photographs and videos of inidual efforts # which went from youngsters toddling a few yards to Somhairle Macdonald running a full marathon to -year-old Christine MacLeod walking a mile # were shared on social media, bringing the whole team, from Calornia to Skye, together.The entire project was not only made possible by the internet it was also turned into a social occasion by the internet.The fact that you are reading this online suggests that you understand most of the terms and concepts expressed above.To some degree, you are what used to be known as #computer literate#.That is not surprising, because most of us are. The UK is online more than most other countries in the world.According to the Office for National Statistics, last year  per cent of UK citizens, including  per cent of Scots, were regular internet users.Within the European Unionwe were third behind only Denmark and Luxembourg when it came to logging in, and ahead of such giants as Germany and France.If computer literacy equalled prosperity, as to some degree it must, we would have little to fear.That is why Skye Camanachd#s fundraiser was so inclusive and so successful.It would not have been as feasible in, for instance, Italy, where a full quarter of the population are strangers to the internet. In Bulgaria, with just  per cent of internet use, it would not even be worth trying.In this country at least, the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet come of age.It has played a formidable part in keeping people connected, in easing the loneliness of elderly folk confined to their homes, in providing entertainment for young and old alike.It has allowed people to work from home: a sector of employment which will almost certainly continue to expand when the virus has gone.It has also, on a less important level, allowed at least one local newspaper to continue to contribute to its community.It is perhaps too easy for the  per cent of us who use the internet regularly, without second thought, to forget the other ten per cent of our compatriots who are not so fortunate.Ten per cent of us, that is half a million people in Scotland alone, cannot or do not use this new technology.Most of them are elderly, but some are not.Some are kids whose parents cannot afford it. Some are those very parents, who find themselves cut adrt from what in normal times had become a mainstay of our society, and which in these extraordinary times is helping to keep us together.There will always be those who opt out:  per cent internet connectivity will not occur in any society at any time.But those who wish to opt in, but are prevented because of poor broadband or expensive servers, should from now on be properly and fully enabled to do so.The internet has become an essential utility, and it should formally be recognised as such.It is as necessary to us as gas and electricity, telephones, the railways, decent sewage and a good water supply.The United Kingdom had until recently a fine record in supplying and maintaining its utilities.Some began in private hands and were nationalised for much of the th century. Others were and remain in the accountable control of local government.Even when the larger British utilities were privatised during the s and s, which was the equivalent of the Conservative Party giving its friends in big business a licence to print money, their unique importance was recognised by the simultaneous establishment of independent watchdogs such as Ofgem and Ofcom # the second of which has, through the telephone network, a vague and ill-defined authority over the internet.That vagueness should be claried that definition should be made in no uncertain terms.Nobody made the internet an essential utility.It has become one by popular consensus.Now that it is no longer a recreational luxury, but a basic necessity for any full member of our st century society, it must be made affordable and properly accessible in every corner of the land.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/martin-sanchez-Tzoe6VCvQYg-unsplash-scaled.jpg","title":"new covid case in skye activates new contact tracing","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe health board was confirmed last week as one of three areas in Scotland to trial new contact tracing s ahead of a national roll-out of the Test, Trace, Isolate and Support strategy aimed at halting the spread of infection.The latest case of Covid- on Skye was reported on Thursday night, and NHS Highland has said it had contacted all those directly affected, given them the appropriate advice and is in the process of organising testing. nursing home, where over  cases were reported and where  residents who tested positive for the virus have died. from the health authority who up until now had refused to give details of where in the board area a case was # citing national guidance on patient confidentiality.Kate Forbes said: “NHS Highland has confirmed that there is another case of Covid on Skye, with somebody testing positive.“Having tested this person, the NHS are now effectively tracing the case and contacting all those who have been in contact with the inidual to give them advice and to test them as well.“As soon as there was confirmation of a positive case in Home Farm earlier this month, NHS Highland tested residents and staff of all the care homes on Skye and contacted the households of staff who had confirmed positive to ensure they self-isolated.“There is an increased testing capacity on the island already, with the mobile testing unit complementing the testing facility in Portree.“All resources and support will be provided to ensure that this case does not spread through the community.

Tha Allt Fionntaig a’ sruthadh a-mach à Loch na Maighe aig a cheann a deas. Thog na Cuimeanaich dàm air an allt, dìreach far a bheil e a’ fàgail an locha. Air taobh an locha dhen dàm, bha dèileachan fiodha. Nuair a dh’èireadh Loch na Maighe, bhiodh an t-eilean air a chòmhdachadh le uisge, agus dh’fheumadh an nàimhdean teicheadh airson am beatha.Uill, bha am plana ag obair. Ach, eadhon mus do dh’èirich an loch ro fhada, bha e follaiseach do Chloinn ʼic an Tòisich gun robh am biadh aca a’ fàs gann, agus gu feumadh iad teicheadh. Thàinig fear dhiubh air adhart. Dh’iarr e air a cheann-chinnidh plana aige a chur an sàs a chuireadh às do na Cuimeanaich. Fhuair e cead., airson tuill a dhèanamh anns na dèileachan.Dh’fhalbh e a-mach ann an dorchadas na h-oidhche. Ràinig e an dàm. Chan fhaca na Cuimeanaich e. Rinn e tuill anns na dèileachan. Chuir e fàsag anns gach toll, agus cheangail e sreangan is ròp do na fàsagan. Tharraing e air an ròp agus thàinig na fàsagan uile a-mach aig an aon àm. Shruth uisge tro na tuill le neart, agus sguabaich e an dàm air falbh. Bha tuil mhòr ann an uair sin.Gu mì-fhortanach do na Cuimeanaich, cha robh luchd-faire aca, agus bha iad a’ campachadh dìreach fon dàm. Chaidh tòrr dhiubh a mharbhadh anns an tuil. Feumaidh nach robh gaisgeach na Maighe luath gu leòr ann a bhith a’ pleadhagaich an ràtha aige air falbh. Chaidh a bhàthadh anns an tuil, no chaidh a mharbhadh le Cuimeanaich.A bheil fìrinn sam bith anns an stòiridh  Dh’fhaodadh gu bheil. Ann an ochd ceud deug, ochdad ʼs a ceithir , chaidh tòrr chlachan, measgaichte le crèadh, a lorg far a bheil an t-allt a’ fàgail an locha. Bhathar a’ smaoineachadh gum b’ e sin pàirt dhen dàm a chaidh a thogail còrr is ceithir cheud bliadhna roimhe.* * * * *roddy.maclean@bbc.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3121081.jpg--.jpg?1589361498000\n","title":"pipe band pays tribute to chairman","story":"Broughshane  District Pipe band are deeply saddened at the sudden death of their esteemed chairman and friend Robert Montgomery.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process.

Conservative MPs had been baying for Mr Johnson to dispense with Mr Cummings after it emerged he had travelled  miles to County Durham in March to self-isolate with his family while official guidelines warned against long-distance journeys. Further reports also suggested he took a second trip to the North East in April, having already ed to London. Mr Cummings denied the fresh allegations, which were reported by the Observer and the Sunday Mirror, and Mr Johnson announced he would be standing by his most senior aide. Leading the Government press conference for the third time since being discharged from hospital on April , Mr Johnson said he could not mark down Mr Cummings for the way he acted. The PM said: I have had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his we were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus - and when he had no alternative - I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. Though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably , I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, during an interview on the BBC#s Andrew Marr programme on Sunday, had denied that Mr Cummings was going to resign. Clamour grew on Sunday for the PM to dispense with the adviser he credited with helping him to win a landslide at the general election last year. A host of Tory MPs piled in to claim the -year-old#s position had become untenable after it was confirmed he journeyed to stay in a family property in Durham when Government advice was to stay home.

The prominent figure in the Brexit campaign told the Sky News# Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: I#m afraid I just think this is the end of the road. Other senior Tories, including Peter Bone and ex-immigration minister Caroline Nokes, also spoke out against Mr Cummings. Craig Whittaker, MP for Calder Valley in West Yorkshire, said Mr Cummings# position was untenable. You cannot advise the nation one thing then do the opposite, he added. Scotland#s leader, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, had also encouraged Mr Johnson to dismiss Mr Cummings before the press conference, having had experience herself of having to fire a close aide for breaking lockdown rules.

Ms Sturgeon tweeted: I know it is tough to lose a trusted adviser at the height of crisis, but when it#s a choice of that or integrity of vital public health advice, the latter must come first. But Downing Street, despite the calls for Mr Cummings to be removed from his post, has continued to back the beleaguered aide. Mr Johnson said he deemed his actions sensible and defensible.

Dr O#Neill, joint chair of the West Belfast GP Federation, echoed the scientic adviser#s view that it will be prudent to plan for a second wave.No one knowsthere will be a second wave, but history tells us there is a probability, Dr O#Neill said, citing the Spanish Flu of , which first appeared early that year then ed in a brutal way in the autumn. If it happens, it will likely be in the winter during the #normal flu season, Dr O#Neill said, adding: It will be prudent to make preparations for the possibility.He added: Nobody knows for certain, but this is a novel virus and strange things are happening almost every day. It is best to be prepared and would be folly not. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Executive’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian Young FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Executive’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian YoungProfessor Young predicted that there will be a lower risk in the summer time as it is known the virus survives less well in the sunlight and outdoors. If exposed to ultraviolet light, the virus is destroyed within minutes, but can survive for between  and  hours on hard surfaces indoors, research shows.The scientic adviser added: There is still risk during that time and as we get into the autumn and winter where people are spending more time indoors, they are closer together, there is not so much sunlight and we have the normal flu season then all of those things add together and certainly increases the risk... and that is definitely something people are thinking about and considering in planning.The advice at this stage is against indoor visits of family members, but the government is allowing family members to meet outdoors.The indoor visits are a signicantly higher level of risk than the outdoor visits, which we are encouraging and the Executive has permitted at the moment, Professor Young said.In terms of indoor activities or business, visits to close family members while maintaining social distancing and being very careful with cleaning surfaces are at the low risk of the spectrum... but right now, they are a step too far, the adviser said, adding that he is urging people to keep those visits outdoors.Professor Young added that his team and others are working on the basis of the R, or reproduction number. It currently sits at approximately ., which reveals how many people are infected by any one inidual.We need to make sure that R stays below one and for us to be certain about that typically takes about two or three weeks , he said. The R number has not changed in any signicant way over the last number of days.When the R number is under one, then the epidemic is under control, Prof Young added, The R number is calculated by crunching data from several weeks, including the number of new cases per day, patients admitted to hospital, those who need critical care treatment, outbreaks in care homes and the number of deaths.

The advice for these people to shield remains in place.This advice is there to protect vulnerable iniduals and keep them safe.This situation won#t last forever. The advice for those shielding will be updated before the  weeks is up and people will be kept updated about what that means for them.Can I travel a distance to meet people outdoors while observing social distancing The changes to the restrictions mean that up to six people who aren#t members of the same household can meet outdoors, while observing social distancing.While you are permitted to travel to do so, people are urged to be sensible, stay localpossible and limit the numbers of journeys you are making.Can I travel for exercise People are permitted to travel to take exercise, but anyone doing so is urged to please be responsible. Don#t travel too far and avoid travelling to places where there are likely to be lots of people where it will be dficult to maintain social distancing.Can I travel on public transport to visit someone outdoors The use of public transport to visit someone outdoors is permitted. But anyone doing so must observe the social distancing measures in place on public transport and observe good hygiene.Those using public transport should also consider using a face covering. And it would be a good idea to avoid peak periods, especially times when key workers are likely to be trying to travel to and from work.Do the relaxations apply to meI#m over   Do the relaxations apply to meI#m pregnant The relaxations apply to everyone, except those who have received a shielding letter. Anyone who has received such a letter should continue to shield.Those aged over , and pregnant women, are considered to be more vulnerable and are advised to be particularly careful about following social distancing guidance and good hygiene. People should follow the public health advice and not put themselves at any increased risk.Can I meet people from other households indoorswe#re very careful with social distancing People who are not from the same household should not meet indoors at this time. The current expert advice is that meeting indoors is still too risky for now. It is recognised that this is an important issue for many people and the situation will be kept under review.Can I go to stay in a caravan People are still not permitted to leave their homes to stay in caravans.

DC Tours is also ramping up marketing of its online tour to colleges, schools and study groups - as current lockdown and travel ban has temporarily shuttered its in-person business.The company is not only targeting those interested in modern Irish history, but also psychology, English language and political geography, among others, said Mark Wylie, who co-founded the company seven years ago.In response to the coronavirus shutdown, DC Tours developed the just over two-hour online experience that includes a tour and a question and answer session with travel guide, Paul #Donzo# Donnelly, also a founder of the company.It has been running now for two weeks with tours on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The tour has attracted visitors from the UK, Ireland and the US, which reflects the demographics of the #in person# walks, Mr Wylie said, adding that those that supported the company through crowd funding in recent weeks were invited to join.The shutdown has focused the minds of those in the company to think dferently, and they are now sending messages out to schools and universities, including those the company had a relationship with previously, the company founder said.It is a fantastic opportunity for the education market, schools, universities, study tours, said Mr Wylie. The idea was there beforehand...butdid not realise the opportunity.The company recognises that the virus will have a long-term effect, even when the lockdown is eased considerably. It may be not possible to host walking tours with  to  people for some time, the DC Tours owner said.From the start of the crisis we have been determined to find a way to keep the company going while keeping our guests and guides safe, said Mr Wylie, who added that the company is grateful for the crowdfunding support from guests who wanted us to get through this because they loved the tour so much.They gave us the vital support we needed to re-imagine the business and create something completely new and unique to Belfast, said Mr Wylie.That support allowed us to spend some time thinking about the sort of experience of Belfast we might be able to offer people in the current climate, he added. And so we did our research and created a brand new #virtual tour# where guests who can#t make it to Belfast this year can still learn about our city#s history from a local. The result is #The History of the Troubles# which launched a few weeks ago and is already proving to be a big hit, with its first dates selling out within hours.On post shut-down, Mr Wylie said: Evenwe can only run smaller tours, we still believe there is a good local audience - people who want to find out more about their own history, or those with children who are studying the conflict as part of their history or politics curriculum.

Read her big interview interviewExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonaldHugh O#ConnellMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThere are two conflicting narratives around how Mary Louise McDonald of Orwell Road, Rathgar, south Dublin, ended up being leader of this island#s most controversial political party.The first, proffered by her critics, is that having come from a Fianna Fail family, she unsurprisingly joined that party in the mid-s. As a bright, articulate and well-educated young woman, her stock was high and Bertie Ahern#s party was on the brink of three successive general election victories. But, recall some in Fianna Fail, she found her path to elected office blocked by the party#s old guard in Dublin West. So she upped and joined Sinn Fein.+realReferrer+\" src\"https:independent.bbvms p embed c .html inheritDimensionstrue\" frameborder\"\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowFullscreen oallowFullscreen msallowFullscreen allowfullscreen The other version, recounted by McDonald, is dferent, perhaps darker, but far more compelling. She vividly recalls the sadness in her house in the spring of  as the hunger strikes in the Maze Prison unfolded, how tense her mother was, the national grief, the protests. Four days before she turned , on May , , Bobby Sands died after  days on hunger strike. It was the moment at which I realised there was something radically, radically wrong in the politics and the le of the Ireland in which I was growing up, McDonald reflected last week.A cynic would ponder how such enlightenment could come so early in le and, evenit did, why it would take nearly  years before McDonald even considered joining the party that Sands represented.Read MoreEilis O#Hanlon:Opinion Mary Lou McDonald is living proof that the real struggle now is about who gets to tell the story of the Troubles... perpetrators or victimsBut it#s her story and she sat down to tell it in detail on Wednesday in Leinster House.Hugh O#Connell: Why have you agreed to sit down with the Sunday Independent Mary Lou McDonald: Well, I don#t think it#s a secret that there have been tensions between the Sunday Independent and Sinn Fein for quite some time. I mean, the editorial line has been, to our way of thinking, quite hostile towards us. But like everything  in le, things move on - people move on, the world changes, politics changes. We came out of the last election having taken more votes than any other political party. We#re now the largest political party on the island, we#re a party that#s preparing to enter into government.I think the Sunday Independent has changed as well, as I observe it from the outside. And I think my first preference would always be to have open dialogue and cordial relations. The Sunday Independent is a big newspaper - so I think now is the right time for us to talk.HOC: Do you think Gerry Adams would have done this MLMcD: I don#t know, to be honest. Was he ever asked HOC: You mentioned before that there were people in the party who didn#t want you to do this.MLMcD: There#d be an anxiety for people who either read or don#t read the Sunday Independent - that it has a very negative view that#s sounded out consistently. Lots of people believe that very often the commentary was unfair.HOC: Did you have to get clearance to do this interview MLMcD: No, absolutely not. Absolutely not.In , Mary Lou McDonald#s parents, Patrick and Joan, separated.The Pope was coming that September, she recalls. At that time - it sounds mad now - but this isn#t something you talked about. For your parents to announce they#d separated, it was a big deal.It was almost like a big scandal because it was one of the great taboos. I mean, back in those days it was a time when that awful term #broken families# was used, so I suppose you didn#t advertise the fact that you came from a broken family.Her mother raised her, her two brothers, Bernard and Patrick, and her sister Joanne. She is reluctant to talk about her relationship with her father. We#re very dferent and we#re very similar, I suppose. So it#s just one of those things, you know.Askedthe relationship was - and remains - dficult with her father, she says: Well, of course it was dficult. I mean your parents separate - of course that#s dficult - and you#re raised by your mother, so of course that#s one of the consequences of people#s parents separating. But I think that we managed it reasonably well.But my mam raised us, so of course that#s dferent thanyou grow up in a household where your parents don#t separate and where you#re all together.It is not something she wishes to discuss further.Privately educated at Notre Dame des Missions in Churchtown, McDonald studied English at Trinity, did an MA in European integration studies at the University of Limerick and went to DCU, where she abandoned a PhD in industrial relations.She doesn#t believe she grew up in privilege but acknowledges she had a privileged education. I#m very well educated and it#s amazing how sometimes those two things are confused. I#ve never been wealthy, I have no prospect to be wealthy and I have no ambition to be wealthy.HOC: [The hunger strikes] radicalised a lot of people. If you had been older at the time, would you have joined the IRA MLMcD: I don#t know, maybe. I certainly understand how it was that people volunteered to [join] the IRA - anybody looking at the circumstances from partition onwards, the nature of the northern state, everything that happened, how young people in particular took the fight to the British state. And, let#s face it, there have been previous chapters where previous generations of young people in a dferent context, but with the same impulse, had equally volunteered to the IRA and taken on that fight.HOC: You must have thought about it, in all the years since then MLMcD: Not hugely - you live the le that you live.HOC: I am putting it to you now. What do you think MLMcD: Yeah, I think there#d be every chance, every possibility. I grew up in Dublin so the Troubles and the conflict were the background noise of my generation.When we were growing up, we were at a distance from it in one sense […] but it was the framing narrative of news broadcasts, night in, night out, the political debate. So growing up in Belfast, growing up in Derry, growing up in Tyrone - they weren#t at a distance, they were right in the middle of the conflict. But you can only live the le that you have lived and I don#t think you can second guess yourself on what you might and what you might not have done. What doesn#t change is the politics that I have and my beliefs in terms of Irish freedom.HOC: A lot of bad things happened in the s, perpetrated by the IRA. You were  when the Enniskillen bomb happened, you were  when the Warrington bombing happened.MLMcD: I remember them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Enniskillen blast aftermath FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Enniskillen blast aftermathHOC: How did that impact on your thinking about republicanism and what the IRA were doing at that time MLMcD: I just think that the whole cycle of armed actions and of violence just became debilitating for everybody.HOC: What did you think at the time about those acts MLMcD: I remember Gordon Wilson [whose daughter was killed at Enniskillen], I remember him recounting how his daughter had said goodbye to him. Anybody seeing that, it was absolutely heartbreaking, it was absolutely devastating. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGordon Wilson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGordon WilsonYou don#t see suffering like that and not feel devastated for the people who are hurt - and all of that happened in a political context. You cite two horric incidents - and they happened all round. That#s the thing when conflict takes a grip, it takes on almost a le of its own and it#s very, very hard to stop that cycle of violence.HOC: Did you think the IRA were wrong to do that  Did you think, #what an appalling act by a group of terrorists #MLMcD: I thought all of the acts of violence were awful.HOC: Did you think they were terrorist acts MLMcD: Back then - and now - I don#t regard that people who fought for Irish freedom were terrorists. I do accept that IRA actions hurt and killed a great many people. I also know that actions of state forces and actors and loyalist paramilitaries similarly caused grief and loss. For me, the important piece of this is not to label any people as #terrorists# but to accept that there was a political context, there was a reason.HOC: Did you see a political context back then MLMcD: Oh, absolutely. And I think that any thoughtful person would have understood. You couldn#t have understood what was happening  miles up the road unless you understood the political context.HOC: An awful lot of people back then - and now - would say that was terrorism.MLMcD: And others would say the terrorists were those who went onto the streets of Derry, and went into Ballymurphy and those who colluded with loyalist death squads to kill people. That argument is circular and frankly gets us nowhere. The important piece, to my way of thinking, is that you have to understand the #why# of a conflictyou#re going to contribute to its resolution.McDONALD#S political le began in Fianna Fail, sometime around  when she joined a branch in Dublin West.Fianna Fail is very comfortable for me, because of my family#s sort of political tradition - in a typical way, where Irish families split along the Civil War lines. My family were anti-treaty and that#s the origins of Fianna Fail.A former Fianna Fail politician, who knew McDonald at the time, said: She was always a star, she was highly intelligent and highly educated. My observation was there was no room for her in Fianna Fail. She was in the same constituency as Brian Lenihan Jr. There was no room for her there.McDonald denies this, says she never met or spoke to Bertie Ahern when she was in Fianna Fail, nor does she believe she was being groomed to run for election. If I was, that#s news to me.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBertie Ahern FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBertie AhernHer interest in the North was evident from her involvement in the Irish National Congress , of which she was chair, at around the same time. The organisation led a protest against an Orange Order plaque being erected on Dawson Street and some INC members were against the Good Friday Agreement.McDonald says she was not one of them, but did harbour concerns at the time about the removal of Articles  and  - the State#s territorial claim to the North - from the Constitution.I suppose at the end of the day, people figured that the negotiators who had gone in, who had thrashed all of this out in all of its aspects, had landed on the best available deal at the time, she says now.The best available deal was sold to hardline republicans by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness - a feat McDonald says she viewed as incredible at the time. She joined Sinn Fein not long after that.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSinn Fein’s Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein’s Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinnessHer middle-class background was not to everyone#s liking. In , when she was picked to run for Europe, one disgruntled party activist, speaking to the Sunday Independent, bemoaned the party picking a spanking new middle-class candidate over an experienced, long-serving working-class candidate.Not that she cared. Then, or now. Obviously I am a middle-class woman. I am who I am. How I was raised and everything, yeah absolutely. It#s not a big thing for me but, yes, I was amused at times, when I initially came on the scene, that I was written up as very posh - like, the poshest human being that ever lived in Ireland. I used to throw my eyes to heaven and say #Oh, for God#s sake#.HOC: You were a favourite of Gerry Adams, weren#t you MLMcD: Yeah, I probably was. Yeah.HOC: How did that make you feel MLMcD: It was grand, yeah… It#s nice to be affirmed, it#s great to be given the chance, it#s great to be given opportunities. It#s great, then, to go out and do the best that you can with the opportunities that you have, to be part of a team, work together. [But] there was lots of other people coming up as well.HOC: You were the party#s MEP candidate in Dublin. You were a big deal.MLMcD: I was the first Sinn Fein MEP, so that was a little bit of history at the time. That was a big deal, that was a huge big deal.HOC: So that put you up ahead of anyone  up-and-coming in the party.MLMcD: Oh, it was a huge deal for me, obviously personally. But it was a hugely big deal for the party in the city and nationally.HOC: In August , you spoke at a Sinn Fein event to commemorate Sean Russell, who was the IRA chief of staff during World War II and is viewed as a Nazi collaborator. Why did you do that  [Russell died in  on a German U-boat travelling to Nazi Germany where he was seeking support for the IRA#s efforts to reunite north and south.]MLMcD: I don#t believe that anybody actually believes that he was a Nazi collaborator. He was certainly a militarist. He was certainly somebody who saw in pretty stark terms that Britain#s problem was Ireland#s opportunity. So there was a commemoration there annually. I was asked to speak at it and I did.HOC: Do you regret speaking at it MLMcD: No. I mean, there were members of his family who still lived in Fairview. Some of them still lived in London and used to come back for the commemoration.HOC: A lot of people would be appalled that you#d speak at a commemorative event for someone like Sean Russell.MLMcD: He was a militarist, but he was not a Nazi collaborator. There#s nothing to support that contention. My assessment of him is that he saw in very narrow terms the struggle for freedom in a framework that was, as I said, #Britain#s problem is our opportunity#. I think that was misguided,that assists you in your line of questioning.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseOn speaking at commemorations: #If you examine the words that are spoken ... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation# FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappOn speaking at commemorations: #If you examine the words that are spoken ... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation#HOC: You don#t have any regrets about doing it MLMcD: It#s like I said earlier on - you have to make your decisions, do your work.HOC: Some people might see that as testing your mettle, your preparedness to back people associated with the IRA, the republican movement, and Sinn Fein who wouldn#t be commemorated by other parties. Do you see it that way MLMcD: No, because I#ve spoken at countless commemorations since and will speak at countless commemorations again.HOC: In , you spoke at a commemoration for the Tyrone Volunteers in Strabane. A lot of victims# campaigners were very annoyed by that. Kenny Donaldson, of the victims and survivors groups, the South East Fermanagh Foundation, said you were associating yourself with a number of commemorative events to those within the republican movement, many of whom were serial killers who murdered their own neighbours because of sectarian and ethnic-motivated hatreds.MLMcD: Well, I don#t accept that assessment - although I absolutely accept the fact that there are survivors and victims across society who need to be acknowledged and supported.HOC: But they feel that you kind of give them two fingers when you do that MLMcD: No. I would invite you to examine the words that I said at that commemoration. What you will find is that a great deal of what I had to say was about healing and reconciliation.And in fact,you examine the words that are spoken at commemorations... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation, about forgiveness, about forging a new future. They#re not occasions on which there is an attempt made to stir up hurt or offence for others. They are used as occasions to assess our republican progress.HOC: A lot of people see these as events that try to justy those actions. A lot of people are appalled by that.MLMcD: Lots of people, I#m sure, are equally appalled at commemorative events for the British army and for loyalism… Those things, those people mattered, they lived, they lived the le that they lived. We had a war, there was a conflict, they lost their lives in the course of that. They have families who live still on this island. I think it is not just valuable to remember, I think it#s essential to remember.HOC: So, IRA volunteers matter MLMcD: Of course they matter. Their people buried them too. Of course they matter. And British soldiers matter and loyalists matter. All of those human lives mattered, every single one of those human lives mattered. The men that died in the Blocks mattered - of course they mattered.HOC: Do you ever think about how much hurt it causes people when you do things like that MLMcD: I met with a group called Wave [Trauma]. They#re actually a group of victims and survivors. Alan McBride, who lost his we in the Shankill Road [bombing], co-ordinates and facilitates them. I met with them, I#ve met with other groups.

I#m always struck by the fact that that#s their primary concern and consideration.HOC: But not all people accept that. Not all victims, not all the families of victims accept that MLMcD: No, and I accept that too.She understands the hurt she causes but sees her role as one of looking forward, not back. My job is to ensure that we have an Ireland and we have a society, politics that ensures that we never have a repeat of what happened through the #s, the #s and into the #s.

Ted#s a great cook. Not alone do I know him, anybody who would have been involved for decades in the whole process of peace and negotiations, they all know him.

Far from resiling from her two-decade defence of everything her predecessors in the republican movement did, McDonald, emboldened by her electoral success, defends them more vocerously now than ever before. It is a strategy which, objectively, is bearing fruit.With a spell as the lead opposition appearing likely, she is making the case for greater state intervention to deal with the fallout from the Covid- crisis. Much of this can be funded from borrowing, she argues. But it is not, as the Taoiseach said last week, free money.HOC: How do we pay for it eventually MLMcD: We work hard, we pay our taxes ... We made the point consistently - banks should not have a honeymoon period in respect of corporate tax. We#ve talked about people on very high incomes, and I#m not talking about people who are well paid…HOC: You#re talking about people on €,-plus MLMcD: €,-plus.[McDonald misspoke here. Sinn Fein#s manesto proposed a pc levy on income above €, - an effective third rate of income tax.]HOC: You think that#s a lot of money MLMcD: Oh, I thinkyou#re earning €,, lucky you, it#s a lot of money. The vast bulk of Irish workers earn less than €,, soyou#re earning €,, more power to you, fair play to you.HOC: It used to be €, and you#ve moved it to €, now, why was that MLMcD: I mean, you sht and move your policies all of the time. When you look at the maths and you have to balance the books and things have to add up and things have to be paid for, you make taxation decisions on that basis.HOC: Is it because it would appeal to more people on Orwell Road MLMcD: No... There#s lots of people on Orwell Road who don#t earn €, - most of them don#t. It#s a very small section of workers who are that lucky.Taxation isn#t an instrument of punishment or vengeance it#s the mechanism by which we raise the funds that collectively we need to provide for the services that we rely on. So it#s movable but, of course, what#s not a movable option is the reality thatyou have more, you pay more.HOC: One of the core wealth taxes in other economies is property tax, but you want to abolish that.MLMcD: If you live in a two-up two-down in East Wall or in Ballyfermot, your house is your sole asset. You#ll have spent your whole working le paying for it - oryou#re a younger person and you#ve negative equity. For some people. it nearly becomes an albatross around your neck. I don#t believe an effective wealth tax is directed at the family home and that#s the dference that we have.Sinn Fein believes the Border poll question cannot be ignored by any party.

Unfortunately, Guy has asked we pass on this.” ‘Guy’ is Guy Pearce, a British-Australian actor, musician and singer-songwriter and crucially, a man who made a guest appearance at Slaughtneil disco back in . While no reason is given for him deciding to pass on our offer to relive the memories, there is a good chance the trip in Sean McGuigan’s silver Renault  may have something to do with it. “I picked him up in Maghera town – I don’t know who got him there, but that’s where I lted him,” says the current club chairperson. googletag.cmd.push “We were going out the road and it just got immediately dark. It scared the wits out of the poor fella. He said, ‘Jesus mate, where are we going to ’. “The poor fella thought he was getting hijacked, but he went in and did all he needed to do.” Pearce was nearing the end of a three-year stint as ‘Mike Young’ in Australian sitcom ‘Neighbours’ after making his acting debut on the show in . Terry McIl was DJ at the time of Pearce’s visit and recalled how hordes of frenzied teenagers packed Slaughtneil hall to the rafters for a glimpse of the star. googletag.cmd.push “There were , people there the night Guy Pearce came. There was even a marquee at the side of Slaughtneil that night as well as the hall being packed.” he said. “They just came up with this idea that they were going to get Guy Pearce. I had to go and buy myself a radio mic for it. He was civil, a nice fella. “He was good with the people, chatty and friendly. Even with the photographs we have, the stage was packed because everyone was up to get autographs and that kind of thing.”  Among those who had made their way to Slaughtneil with fancy notions of chatting to the Neighbours star were three girls who ended up getting closer than they had bargained for. The rush to the front caused a bit of a crush, and amid the screaming and the heat, a few of the girls who were closest fainted. They were hastily dragged onto the stage by the bouncers. Cathy Rennie was one of those who were lted out of the crowd and said she was sure to make the best of a bad situation. “I don’t know how I got up near the front, to tell you the truth,” said the Dungiven woman. “I don’t even know what he was doing on the stage, whether he was singing or anything, but I just felt myself getting all faint. “The next thing there was somebody lting me. Two bouncers lted me up onto the stage and it was near where he was at. He just looked round and smiled at me and I touched his hand. “I think he had on a black leather jacket and I just grabbed him. It’s a wonder he didn’t take me for assault! “Then I was took to the back of the stage and there were a couple of girls sitting there who had fainted too. We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

Shrouded in darkness on a Friday evening, its charms were not easily advertised, butthe mountain would not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. But how would south Derry’s teenage prophets get there  “Putting on the Ulsterbuses and all the coaches is what really got it going. They came in fairly quickly and it did the trick,” said current club chairperson Sean McGuigan. “Darragh’s and McLaughlin’s only had maybe four buses and they were a wee bit reluctant to send good buses to the disco. Ulsterbus were a great saviour.” googletag.cmd.push Every Friday evening, a group of hardy bus drivers would set off from towns across Derry, delivering the county’s youth to Slaughtneil hall. It wasn’t for everyone. Pat McGlade, who drove the Draperstown bus for a brief period as the disco was drawing to a close, beat a hasty exit. “I was never at Slaughtneil in my le, I didn’t even know where it was at, but the first night I landed, we got them off and the fighting started,” he said. “I said, ‘JesusI get out of here tonight, I’ll not be back!’. I’d never seen the like of it – they were killing each other that night!” googletag.cmd.push His predecessor, Loup man Sean Glendinning, approached the journey with a little more relish. “They all called me Big Sean for some reason. I wasn’t that big, but I would have gave an odd roar out of me and they sort of listened to me!” he said. “I got on well with them, really. You can’t put old heads on young bodies. You have to be flexible, andyou work with young people, they’ll work with you. “We had no real hassle on the bus, the young people were easy talked to. I gave them a bit of space and they knew how far they could go with you. I never had any hassle. “You’d have got a bit of fighting, but you never passed any remarks on it. It wasn’t too bad, just a bit of a row. “I used to tell the young boys thatthey wanted to box, to go and do it in the ring and earn a bit of money. “The worst bit was whenever the snow was on, you got a bit of a snowballing! There was many a hairy night about it now, but we made it, we got there.” Every night the fleet of drivers was ushered into the club’s kitchen and were wined and dined in traditional GAA style, with plenty of sandwiches, tea and biscuits to be had. “We were well looked after up there,” said Sean. “Once you got there, they took you into the club and Willie Hampson was the main man. You got your tea and all the drivers got a fiver. “You had men from everywhere. The Ulsterbuses came from Kilrea and Dungiven and you had men from all round. Good times and good chat. There was the odd lie told! “The kettle was going and there would be biscuits and a bit of craic. There were four or five in at one time and one or two would have stayed out to keep an eye on the buses.” Willie Hampson is held in high esteem by all the drivers and his hospitality on a Friday night is remembered fondly when they recall the disco. “Willie Hampson looked after the bus drivers and he was some man,” said Colm McGuigan, who started driving the Dungiven bus around . “He used to try and give us all a fiver, but we would have left it all and split it at Christmas time. I would say Slaughtneil got me through twelve Christmases when the weans were young!”  Colm is the current Derry GAA kit man and never tires of reminding the Slaughtneil players of his role in their success. “I used to slag the Slaughtneil men when they came on the Derry team that it was me built their club, bringing all the weans over,” he said. An Ulsterbus employee, he did the school runs by day from Limavady depot, and it was after some pestering from a few of the pupils that the routes to Slaughtneil expanded. “When I started, it was only Dungiven going over to it. They would have gathered at the bus depot and two buses would have left,” said Colm. “A year or so into it, the school weans used to say ‘would you not put a bus on to Slaughtneil ’ “I was in Limavady depot at the time, so I talked to a few of the drivers and we said we’d book a bus ourselves in our own name.” Demand for the bus shot up as hordes of teenagers clamoured for a place every Friday night, but the Troubles still cast a shadow over South Derry in the s and s, and the chances of stumbling on a security checkpoint with an overloaded bus were high. “Some nights there were maybe  weans on the bus, but we were lucky, we were never stopped,” said Colm. “I remember we left Limavady during holiday time with about  in a -seater. Another  or  got on in Drumsurn, another  or  in Ballerin and by that time I was looking down the bus thinking ‘Jesus, how many is in this thing ’ “When I got theof Glenullin, there were  weans standing and I was thinking ‘what am I going to do here ’ “I put the  weans on anyway and they were up in the racks and everywhere, so I said to myself I couldn’t go down onto the main road with these weans. “I had to put the bus into first gear to get it over the top of that hill past the Gaelic pitch and I took it over the back roads into Slaughtneil. “I came back that way and once I got those weans left off in Glenullin, I was happy enough to go down onto the main road again after that!” In order to reduce the potential for mischief on the buses, the GAA club provided bouncers who would travel on the bus with the drivers. Colm generally preferred to police the bus himself and recalls one night in particular when support came from an unlikely corner. “One night I couldn’t get a driver, so I had to drive it myself. This boy got on with a bag of drink,” he said. “Usually you weren’t allowed it, they just poured it down the drain, but this boy was a bit older than the rest of them and had a bag, so I took it off him and told him he’d get it after. “I put it in around the cab. He behaved badly on the way over and I warned him a few times, so coming back again I said, ‘you behave yourself til we get home.’ “He didn’t do so bad until we got theof Drumsurn and he went clean mad again, wrecking and tearing at the back of the bus. “We got to Limavady and he came to me and said, ‘I want my drink’ and I said ‘you’re not getting it, you didn’t behave yourself.’ “He drew out and he hit me and knocked the glasses off me. He had long hair and I managed to grab him, and the next thing was he landed out onto the street. “I looked and the police were sitting in the Landrover. I could see them coming and I thought ‘Jesus I’m in bother.’ “He got up and ran and the policemen chased him. The two cops came down then and askedI was alright andI wanted to press charges. “I said ‘naw you’re alright’ and they said, ‘you did a brave job with him anyway’ and I never heard another word about it.” Despite the odd bit of trouble here and there, Colm is full of praise for the Slaughtneil clubmen who kept things under control. “All the boys that were looking after the disco were pioneers. They were great clubmen and they were never short,” he said. “Even when the younger boys that were going to the disco in the early days, when they got past it they were doing their bit at it too. “It gave them a serious name in those early days, and it put a bit of a push on the other clubs about the county to make their club as financially strong as Slaughtneil.” With his parents’ house being in Maghera, Colm was able to take advantage by dropping in for a visit while the hundreds of teenagers he transported were dancing just a few miles out the road. “Every Friday night I would have reversed the bus up to the side of the house and watched The Late, Late Show with my mother and father,” he said. “You had to rush back to get up before the parents came up in cars. It would take you  or  minutes to get out, but it was well-marshalled and it was a good time for the weans.” The bus drivers who braved the roads leading to Slaughtneil disco kept teenagers dancing in the South Derry hills. They became the trustworthy ferrymen of teenage dreams.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil disco. The Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. googletag.cmd.push “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. googletag.cmd.push “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us. “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There is a wide range of financial support available to firms of all sizes. Today we take a look at how some companies have benefited from the help available. Furlough scheme ‘offers a leline to many businesses’  WORKING HARD: A Seating Matters employee producing medical equipment at the company’s workshop CASE STUDY PROTECTIVE GEAR A COUNTY Derry company has been protecting health care workers by supplying high-end protective gear for intensive care units during the COVID- crisis. Seating Matters, based outside Ballykelly, has been able to use the Government’s furlough scheme to protect about a quarter of its -strong workforce, while also helping provide box shields to protect healthcare workers while they are ventilating patients googletag.cmd.push The family-owned company has specialised in creating chairs to provide comfort, postural support, pressure management and improve quality of le for disabled adults and children since . During the COVID- outbreak, however, the company has teamed up with medical experts and designers to create the box shields. Managing director Martin Tierney said: “We have been making clinical therapeutic chairs for hospitals and we are very close to the front line in that respect because a lot of our chairs are being used in intensive care and in COVID wards.” Seating Matters was established by Martin’s mother Martina, an occupational therapist who had identied a global demand for therapeutic chairs. googletag.cmd.push It now has  staff but Mr Tierney said it had to furlough a quarter of its staff. He said the government furlough scheme was a leline for many businesses. Mr Tierney said: “I’m grateful that we can keep moving forward because there are a lot of places that are stopped altogether. I’m just grateful that we are not in that boat.” The firm has strict social distancing and changed an office entrance in order to safeguard staff against coronavirus infection. ‘Critical to Scouts’ survival’  HELPING HAND: Scouts Scotland supports , volunteers and , young people CASE STUDY SCOUTS SCOTLAND SCOUTS SCOTLAND chief executive Katie Docherty says the Coronavirus Job Retention Schemehas been absolutely critical to the survival of Scouts Scotland as an organisation. Almost  per cent of Scouts Scotland’s  staff have been furloughed as outdoor education centres and campsites have been closed and fundraising events have postponed due to the coronavirus lockdown. The organisation, which supports , volunteers and , young people in Scotland, has suffered a pound. million shortfall as a result. Ms Docherty said they had received some funding from the Scottish Government, but that furlough scheme is “the leline that’s keeping us going just now”. She said: “It’s the furlough scheme that’s allowed us to keep paying our staff whilst we have no income coming in. It’s been absolutely critical. We would have had to make most of our staff redundant otherwise.” The CJRS has been extended until the end of October by the UK Government in order to protect businesses and jobs across the country. Chancellor’s measures to safeguard firms and their staff  FINANCIAL HELP: Chancellor Rishi Sunak The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a range of measures for businesses and workers to protect them against the current economic emergency.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

Any timescale is a matter for the Executive following consultation with the Chief MedicalOfficerand Public Health Authority . Only when the Executive judges that conditionsare suitable and the key criteria to inform this judgement are presented within the Executive’s document, can sport resume. Initial focus will be on the sht from the current RED Phase to an AMBER phasewhen certain outdoor sports can start activity in small groups . Following any announcements from the Executive, sports will have a short period of notice before any easing in public health measures to initiate a move towards amber. googletag.cmd.push WATCH: Sport NIs Director of Performance Peter McCabeCLICK HERE... A risk assessment will need to be carried out, including numbers involved, social distancing andidentication of a safe space for isolation of an inidual should they become unwell and education will need provided to participants.  In time and when the Covid- outbreak is contained sufficiently, focus will sht on to step  which will be an extended YELLOW Phase when both outdoor and indoor sport activity would take place in larger groups, up to  people. The next progression would be to a GREEN phase which would lead to full training and competition across sports in line within general PHA guidelines that exist at the time, a re-opening of leisure centres and spectators able to attend live sporting events in restricted numbers. googletag.cmd.push Completion of each phase will represent a key milestone in the progression towards the resumption of sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland. The time spent in each step may y, from a minimum of three weeks, butany of the criteria are met, this could stretch to six weeks, or more. Caution will be important at each step but especially during the AMBER phase which encompasses steps  and step  of the Executive’s Pathway to recovery. It provides for all sports, including outdoor recreation, from grassroots level to high performance sport andprofessional athletes. Sport NI recognises that there are dferent categories, to cover the range in a manner that is useful and applicable within Northern Ireland.  - Outdoor RecreationHill walking, orienteering, mountain biking, angling - Water sportsCanoeing, rowing, sailing, surfing, swimming - Non-ContactWeight-lting, golf, tennis, cricket, bowls, archery, cycling, athletics, equestrian, motorsports - Contact - lower risk Soccer, Gaelic football, camogie, hurling, hockey, netball, basketball - Contact - higher riskRugby, boxing, wrestling, karate - High Performance   Professional athletes Here is the pathway for contact lower risk sports below. The rest can be viewed via the link below  “It is vitally important that we emerge from lockdown in a managed, safe and consistent way and this Framework will help with this process,” commented Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey. “I would urge the sports sector to use this Framework as they finalise their own protocols.” Also commenting was Antoinette McKeown, Sport NI CEO. “There is a huge appetite across sports athletes, coaches, fans and spectators toto sport and many sports are actively planning how to implement the first step on this pathway,” she said. “Sport NI’s Framework aims to facilitate that and acts as an important bridge between the NI Executive’s document and the more detailed protocols that sports will need to develop on an inidual basis.” She commended the sporting bodies for their response to Covid- and highlighted the role they still have to play. “Through responsible actions within each phase and at each of the five steps of the Executive’s pathway to recovery, all sport participants can play their part in gradually and safely transitioning NI towards a new type of normality.” The full document can be viewed here...

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

I lost a few people to the Foyle and I wrote a poem about it A River of Tears which people really connected with. That is my favourite poem and one that resonates this week because of Mental Health Awareness Week.

Debbie shares her poetry on Facebook and has been approached in the past about publishing a collection of her work. If I write something and someone relates to it then thats great, she said, If it lts someones spirits thats enoughfor me really.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

From skipping to keepy uppys, Hanging Tough to Netball Shootouts, the Faughanvale staff showed their sporting talents and set targets for the children to beat. Being confined to home means that our pupils who are normally immersed in exercise, through school PE, after school activities, organised sport and outdoor play, have had to find a new normal,” commented Vice Principal Ciaran OHare. The Sink the Staff challenge, is the most recent initiative by the staff in what has proved to be a busy few months. Their Music co-ordinator, Miss Moore has captivated the pupils through the creation of the Virtual Choir, releasing new songs each week for the pupils to perform. googletag.cmd.push The PE coordinator, Mrs McKeever has continually promoted a healthy and active lestyle in the build up to a Virtual Sports Day in early June. Moving more and sitting less are key to help our pupils maintain physical and mental health. Launching the Sink The Staff challenge on Mental Health Awareness week, would make that connection stronger,” OHare added. Our staff have been absolutely brilliant and jumped at the opportunity to engage our pupils through exercise challenges. Whilst stepping out of their comfort zone, the staff knew that this would create a great buzz of excitement and lt the spirits of the children. googletag.cmd.push Each day, two  second challenges were posted on the schools social media accounts, encouraging the pupils to take on the mite of the staff and to video their best efforts. The response from the children was incredible and indicative of the amazing support we receive daily from our families. The bond between school and parish has never been stronger,” Ciaran continued. Over the course of the  challenges, the school had in excess of  videos, with each child relishing the opportunity to take on the staff in their school. I hope that amid the gloom of this pandemic, our pupils will look back fondly at the week they took on and proved victorious against the school staff. Restoring a little piece of normality and structure to the lives of the pupils has been so important,” he concluded. The competitive spirit may have been lying dormant within Faughanvale in recent weeks. The Sink the Staff challenge has whet the appetite of our pupils as we look forward to our Virtual Sports Day on June th.

From skipping to keepy uppys, Hanging Tough to Netball Shootouts, the Faughanvale staff showed their sporting talents and set targets for the children to beat. Being confined to home means that our pupils who are normally immersed in exercise, through school PE, after school activities, organised sport and outdoor play, have had to find a new normal,” commented Vice Principal Ciaran OHare. The Sink the Staff challenge, is the most recent initiative by the staff in what has proved to be a busy few months. Their Music co-ordinator, Miss Moore has captivated the pupils through the creation of the Virtual Choir, releasing new songs each week for the pupils to perform. googletag.cmd.push The PE coordinator, Mrs McKeever has continually promoted a healthy and active lestyle in the build up to a Virtual Sports Day in early June. Moving more and sitting less are key to help our pupils maintain physical and mental health. Launching the Sink The Staff challenge on Mental Health Awareness week, would make that connection stronger,” OHare added. Our staff have been absolutely brilliant and jumped at the opportunity to engage our pupils through exercise challenges. Whilst stepping out of their comfort zone, the staff knew that this would create a great buzz of excitement and lt the spirits of the children. googletag.cmd.push Each day, two  second challenges were posted on the schools social media accounts, encouraging the pupils to take on the mite of the staff and to video their best efforts. The response from the children was incredible and indicative of the amazing support we receive daily from our families. The bond between school and parish has never been stronger,” Ciaran continued. Over the course of the  challenges, the school had in excess of  videos, with each child relishing the opportunity to take on the staff in their school. I hope that amid the gloom of this pandemic, our pupils will look back fondly at the week they took on and proved victorious against the school staff. Restoring a little piece of normality and structure to the lives of the pupils has been so important,” he concluded. The competitive spirit may have been lying dormant within Faughanvale in recent weeks. The Sink the Staff challenge has whet the appetite of our pupils as we look forward to our Virtual Sports Day on June th.

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

I wasn’t on all fours exactly so I didn’t fit the bill for treatment. When the job was finally completed and my plants began to grow nicely I had a running battle with slugs and, no, used tea bags do not keep the wee blighters away from your lettuce. I should get some tips from that County Tyrone photographer who dug up his front lawn to grow vegetables when he couldn’t get out to work. Jim Kerr said the gardening acted as a kind of therapy for him. I must remember that.Sticking to the safe distance rules isn’t easy. I forget myself at times whilst out walking the dog which leaves me having to perform a quick jump right or left with him yelping as I almost fall over him.

There’s been a lot of sunny days and what I wouldn’t give to take off in the car to the North Coast just to see something dferent.Ahead, there’s the possibility of a severe depressionwe can’t get our economy back on track. Unemployment is soaring into the millions and, no, the people do not want to go and pick fruit and vegetables from the ious English farms. That’s too much like hard work I suspect though I recall, as a young child, many men leaving the province and catching the Liverpool ferry and then going by train to the fruit and vegetable farms in the south. Farmers are currently looking for , UK workers as there is a shortage of the usual seasonal workers from Europe who are facing travel restrictions. When the furlough arrangement, where the Government pays  per cent of people’s wages, ends, for many there may be no jobs toto. It could be back to the s when massive workers’ strikes could not save jobs as technology was turning industry upside down.There is the other possibility that working from home can be more profitable for employers and employees – a headline in the News Letter’s business pages this week indicated that workers were getting more work done at home. The possibility that home could be the next workplace is not as far fetched as it seems. It could solve our pollution problems, doing wonders for our planet.

No-one decides it for you, it depends on your personal history and beliefs and values.But citizenship is something we share with everyone who has the same citizenship. It grants us rights and protections and other countries recognise you as being part of the national community that granted it to you.I’ve lived all my le in that national community, I was born in a hospital, built and staffed by that community, drive on roads built by it, went to schools paid by it and now pay my taxes into the same United Kingdom communal funds that pay for our schools, our hospitals and police.To say that anyone who is automatically entitled to all these benefits should automatically be considered been part of our national community seems to be quite jarring.Our access to citizenship should not be treated any dferently from other parts of the same nation, because of someone ’s personal identity.Supporters of Emma DeSouza quote the Belfast Agreement, but that is a document that first and foremost confirms Northern Ireland’s position within the national community .By all means reject your citizenship nowyou want to, burn the flag you are giving upyou wish to do so, it makes a greater point to give something away than claim you never had it.But do not demand I be treated unequally to my fellow countrymen in regards to my automatic UK citizenship.Do not pick apart the agreement that allows us to find a path together peacefully.

travels","story":"While the Prime Minister, speaking at the Downing Street press conference, said his most senior adviser ldquoacted responsibly, legally and with integrity, there remain questions about Mr Cummingrsquos decision to make the initial journey, along with the further allegations levelled against the -year-old.ndash Why did he need to go  miles north The argument pushed by Number  is that Mr Cummings, fearing there would be no one to look after his four-year-old sonhe and his we became ill with coronavirus at the same time, travelled to be near his family in County Durham to seek childcare.Yet Labour shadow policing minister Sarah Jones said, in an interview on Sky Newsrsquo Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, she knew of ldquosingle mothers who have had Covid-, when their child has had to stay with them and neighbours and volunteers had to ldquochip-in food so they can eat.Given the sacrices made by others, critics have queried why Mr Cummings, as someone involved in setting the lockdown rules, could not call on any friends or family in London to assist them in adhering to the restrictions.ndash Did he have Covid- when travelling The PM tested positive for coronavirus on March  and Number  confirmed that Mr Cummings developed symptoms over the weekend of March -.He was seen running out of Downing Street on March , shortly after it was confirmed publicly that Mr Johnson had the virus. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings began showing symptoms over the weekend of March -, No  said On Friday, a statement issued by Durham Constabulary suggested Mr Cummingsrsquo father had confirmed his son was self-isolating in the North East as of March .Given the average incubation period for Covid- is five days, but can be as long as , the four-day gap between the two dates suggests he could have been asymptotic while travelling.ndash Did he have to stop en route to Durham Driving  miles across the country with a four-year-old and a sick we in the car, who was already displaying Covid- symptoms, Mr Cummings might well have needed to stop for a break.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was asked during the Sunday morning media round about whether the family took a pit stop, but said he did not know the answer.But he argued Mr Cummings was a ldquostickler for social-distancing rules, indicating he would have abided by them during any stop-off. vw,vw,px, px\"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended Dominic Cummings over his lockdown travels on Sunday The Cabinet minister told Sophy Ridge: ldquoI saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart, so I know he is a stickler for those rules about what to do to make sure you are following the two-metre rule and the like, so Irsquom sure that they took all the necessary precautions.ndash Did he go on a day trip to Barnard Castle The Observer and Sunday Mirror reported that an eyewitness ndash Robin Lees, a -year-old former teacher ndash saw Mr Cummings with his we and child at Barnard Castle, a popular tourist spot  miles from Durham, on April .Downing Street has not specically addressed this allegation, but Mr Shapps suggested the Easter Sunday outing,it took place, ldquowould have been outside the -day period for self-isolation.Government advice is that anyone suffering from coronavirus symptoms must quarantine for seven days after contracting the virus.And guidance issued by the National Police Chiefsrsquo Counciland the College of Policing in early April advised officers not to punish people for using their cars to drive ldquoa reasonable distance for exercise.ndash Why is the PM standing by him Mr Johnson said he thought his aide acted in the best interests of his child, acting in a way ldquoany parent would frankly understand.But Tory MPs have questioned the Conservative leaderrsquos judgment in backing him, complaining they remain ldquounconvinced by the PMrsquos defence.Former minister Paul Maynard said Mr Cummingsrsquo case seemed ldquoutterly indefensible.It is a classic case of do as I say, not as I do ndash and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up.It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable.  mdash Paul Maynard MPMay , ndash Was his son cared for by family while in Durham Mr Cummingsrsquo defence for his actions, along with the PMrsquos justication for keeping him on, hinges on the belief he and his we could need childcarethey both became unwell.In No rsquos Saturday statement setting out what went on, it made no reference to his son being looked after by family members, only that Mr Cummingsrsquo sister ldquoshopped for the family and left everything outside their property, which is said to be adjacent to the family home.ndash Was the childcare caveat to the ldquoStay at homeldquo message made clear in Government messaging Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Governmentrsquos ldquoStay at home guidance was an instruction, ldquonot a request at a briefing on April . vw,vw,px, px\"Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer But deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries had said at a daily Downing Street press briefing on March  that a small child could be considered ldquovulnerable and therefore provide exemptions from the stringent rulestheir carers became ill.Dr Harries said: ldquoAlthough we are encouraging everybody to stay in their own householdshellipclearlyyou have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance.For those who were listening

by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss

Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not

support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council
